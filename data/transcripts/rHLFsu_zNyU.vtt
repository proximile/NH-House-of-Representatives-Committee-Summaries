and we'll start with the introduction
 
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
apparently

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chair good morning to
 
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
the members of the Commerce Committee uh
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Jess Edwards from
 
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
Rockingham uh District 31 representing
 
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 align:start position:0%
um my my my town of Auburn Candia
 
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
Chester and Deerfield I'm here today to
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
introduce house bill 172.
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
um now to my right is a representative
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
leishman we both have a finance
 
00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 align:start position:0%
committee starting right about now so I
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to talk for long
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
but you have some really great people in
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
the in the audience today who can
 
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
amplify this
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to
 
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go and point out that uh it
 
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
it it is the goal of the New Hampshire
 
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
legislature and and the executive branch
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
to assist with
 
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
um assist with trying to make sure that
 
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh prescription drugs can be made
 
00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
available to the market affordably and
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's so much of an objective that we've
 
00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 align:start position:0%
already implemented several programs
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
both at the federal and state level
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
this is the latest of multiple attempts
 
00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:40.259 align:start position:0%
to try to do the same thing and so I'm
 
00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:43.259 align:start position:0%
not here to dissuade you from the
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
objective of trying to do what we can to
 
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
assist with affordability I'm really
 
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
here to say that this legislation was
 
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.370 align:start position:0%
here to say that this legislation was
created

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.089 align:start position:0%
created
um

00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
in a way in which the house did not hear
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
it normally so there was no house uh
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
hearing on it or testimony back when the
 
00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
bill was originally passed the way it
 
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
got passed was through uh what was
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
called the Christmas tree or an Omnibus
 
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.309 align:start position:0%
called the Christmas tree or an Omnibus
Bill

00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
and it didn't get the respect it
 
00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
deserved and I think in our haste to do
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
it we took a some model legislation that
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
has been implemented by Maine and other
 
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:32.459 align:start position:0%
states I think representative leishman
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
or somebody is going to testify to who
 
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
else has been trying this but the
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
results no no one's no one doing this is
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
producing results and and so I'm just
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
generally a guy who wants
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
government if it's going to do something
 
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.290 align:start position:0%
government if it's going to do something
important

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
to do it well and not to be redundant
 
00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:58.220 align:start position:0%
and not to be wasteful and in this case
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
the the affordability board is on the
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
precipice of issuing tax levies
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
upwards to about six hundred and fifty
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to the Pharma industry
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
various players in the Pharma industry
 
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
and I I know that the members of the
 
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.949 align:start position:0%
and I I know that the members of the
board

00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
do not view this as a tax levy and so
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
when I say tax levy it's it's probably a
 
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
bit offensive to some people who see
 
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
this as a fee
 
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
I think it's a tax levy because
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
um our fees are intended to provide some
 
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
governmental benefit to the people who
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
pay the fee like a marriage license fee
 
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:47.300 align:start position:0%
for example this this is a
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
a tax on the farm industry so that we
 
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
can make them give us data that we may
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
already be getting so that we can do
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
some data analysis that's already
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
possible to produce a report that we
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
don't really know exactly what's going
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
to be done with it and so so to me what
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
this bill does is just say let's time
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
out let's look before we leap
 
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.630 align:start position:0%
out let's look before we leap
um

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
by looking we're we're asking to
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
investigate the status quo and what this
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
board does
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
we'd like the department of
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
administrative Services the insurance
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
department and DHHS to look for
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
potential redundancies that's on line 15
 
00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:36.620 align:start position:0%
and 16 of page one
 
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
we already know that the department of
 
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:43.100 align:start position:0%
administrative Services reverse auctions
 
00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:47.579 align:start position:0%
in this area and Mr arlinghaus has told
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
me in public hearing that he thinks that
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's successful and is accomplishing
 
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:55.220 align:start position:0%
much of what was intended by this bill
 
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
we we are and that's in statute we
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
already know that at the state and
 
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
federal level we have things like the
 
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Comprehensive Health
 
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
Information System and we also have the
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
federal Consolidated Appropriations Act
 
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
all intended to solve the same problem
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
in this same space in different ways and
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
this this program did not really get uh
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
integrated or smoothed with those others
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
um that investigative report would be a
 
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:31.820 align:start position:0%
due by one November 23
 
00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:34.019 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and in parallel we're
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
asking HHS oversight committee which is
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
a joint committee of the of the
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
legislature to uh to to begin looking
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
into this as well with some very
 
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
specific items those are on page two
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
from line five to Eighteen with the
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
final report date of the November 1st of
 
00:11:55.079 --> 00:11:56.630 align:start position:0%
final report date of the November 1st of
24

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
24
 
00:11:59.690 --> 00:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
and until we can do all of that we're
 
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
saying let's take a time out let's
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
suspend operations under this bill this
 
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
is not a repeal of the bill this is a
 
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
time out so that we can look before we
 
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
leap again we're on the verge of issuing
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
new tax bills for 650 000 and uh and I
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
don't even know that most legislature
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
legislators appreciate that we've got a
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
650 000 new tax in a Hang Fire situation
 
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:32.060 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to stop
 
00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:35.459 align:start position:0%
one other small thing just that just is
 
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
was a little irritating and reviewing
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
all of this is that of all of our
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs 46 percent of those
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
drugs are are done through special
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
prescriptions which are or managed and
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
created in a in a hospital uh
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
environment and don't come through the
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
national Pharma companies directly and
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
that's 40 46 percent of New Hampshire's
 
00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:05.339 align:start position:0%
drug costs yet this board was not going
 
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
to look at them uh instead they were
 
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
going to focus on things like the
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
prescription drug or the prescription
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
benefit managers there seemed to be an
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
inherent bias to not look at the entire
 
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
problem but to miss 46 percent of it I I
 
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
think they've since figured fixed that
 
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:28.019 align:start position:0%
but I'm still worried that they're going
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
to blend this white bag approach that's
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
meant to be competitive with the
 
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
hospital system costs so we'll never
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
really see what the right policy is and
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
providing those special prescriptions
 
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
and and so so in in an area that seems
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
to me to be apparently a place where we
 
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
have to worry about affordability I'm
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
just not sure that we're going to get
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
any actionable information and
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
um I I can take questions but Mr chair
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
I'd recommend letting representative
 
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
leishman do his intro and then the
 
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
committee if they have questions were
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
both available
 
00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:08.339 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
please representative Leachman
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee for the record my
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
name is Peter leishman I represent
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
Peterborough and Sharon Hillsborough 33.
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's nice to follow
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards because he
 
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
covered just about everything that you
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
should know so uh I'm certainly here to
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
address any questions you may have but
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
also to point out some of my concerns
 
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
that representative Edwards did not
 
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
bring up but they have a position as uh
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
for an executive director and the cost
 
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
of that position is about 166
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
000 with a an assistant an
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant that they have
 
00:14:52.449 --> 00:14:52.459 align:start position:0%
budgeted 75 000 for
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at some of our pay scales
 
00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
for even assistant commissioners of this
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
state such as the insurance
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner's Deputy I think he's uh
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
getting somewhere in the neighborhood of
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
a hundred and twenty thousand dollars
 
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
and has the oversight of dozens and
 
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
dozens of individuals so there's a cost
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
element here there's a transparency
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
matter here as far as I'm concerned and
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards as representative
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
Edwards pointed out
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
this didn't receive its normal review by
 
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
the finance committee specifically
 
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
division three it did not receive any
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
review from the ways and means
 
00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
committees as far as the establishment
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
of fees so I think is again
 
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
representative Edgewood stated we need
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
to take a step back and take a hard look
 
00:15:41.449 --> 00:15:41.459 align:start position:0%
at this board before we go further
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
if I could just uh add to my earlier
 
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.170 align:start position:0%
if I could just uh add to my earlier
comment

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
um that this is my reasonable Bill uh
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
the other bill that I think is coming to
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
Commerce uh recommends just killing this
 
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
board outright uh the point of this bill
 
00:15:59.930 --> 00:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
is uh let's talk because I know there
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
are Advocates of the program and I I
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
hope those who are advocating for the
 
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
program will will do a reasonable thing
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
and just take the time to talk about it
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
and work through it to make sure that
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
whatever we end up doing it's it's it's
 
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
reasonable and integrated with existing
 
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.069 align:start position:0%
reasonable and integrated with existing
efforts

00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
all right we'll open up uh questions
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
um representative can you tell us why
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
um uh the bill proposes to spend suspend
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
certain Authority this is um section
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
four at the very end why the bill
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
proposes to suspend certain Authority uh
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a good question I think
 
00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
uh representative leishman uh hit on on
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
the on the main wise pretty pretty well
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
where uh they're on the precipice of
 
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
hiring uh an expensive executive
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
director and an exec an expensive
 
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:08.339 align:start position:0%
assistant to the executive director and
 
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh that we're going to have to establish
 
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
you know additional Manpower in the
 
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.909 align:start position:0%
you know additional Manpower in the
system

00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:17.339 align:start position:0%
um so so I would like to suspend it so
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
that we don't go with those hires
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
because at this point without the
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
program being clear it's not clear that
 
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
we what we would be asking of these
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
quarter million dollar total employees
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
so so there's that and then they are so
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
close in the jail car process that
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
within a month or two they're getting
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
ready to issue tax levies uh on an order
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
of six hundred and fifty thousand
 
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
dollars to the Pharma industry and and
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
and I think uh what we're trying to do
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
is trying to make sure that before we
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
tax somebody we know what we're doing we
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
know how it's going to be used we're
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
convinced it's a good purpose and that
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's efficient
 
00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
further inquiry
 
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:05.220 align:start position:0%
follow thank you uh
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
could you tell us a little bit more
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
about the proposed tax where you said it
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
earlier it might be considered a fee can
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
you explain
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
what that is proposed for and how it's
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
yes I can thank you for the question
 
00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:24.669 align:start position:0%
yes I can thank you for the question
um

00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
what the existing law provides for is
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
that once the the the the the board's
 
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
budget is approved and I'm still trying
 
00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
to figure out exactly how that's done
 
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming it's going to be part of
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget process I hope
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
it's part of the governor's budget
 
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
process but once that budget gets
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
approved they have the authority to
 
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.230 align:start position:0%
approved they have the authority to
Levy

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
Levy
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
fees taxes of 125 percent of that budget
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
and what what I understand at this point
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
is that they have a five hundred
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar proposed budget that
 
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
they'd like and and 125 percent of that
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
would be six hundred and fifty thousand
 
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.330 align:start position:0%
would be six hundred and fifty thousand
dollars

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me further inquiry further
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
um but what are they proposing to
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
Levy that you say they're proposing to
 
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
Levy that fee on the Pharma industry but
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
what for
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
you want to take them
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question uh they have
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
put forward a proposal their proposed
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
budget and they would be assessing a fee
 
00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:39.500 align:start position:0%
of 700 dollars per
 
00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:43.100 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that's uh there are 442
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
identified manufacturers that they have
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
identified the bill the 700 to then
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.679 --> 00:19:53.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
Distributors that they would send bills
 
00:19:55.919 --> 00:19:56.870 align:start position:0%
Distributors that they would send bills
to

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
also additional pharmacies 37 so a total
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
income of almost six hundred thousand
 
00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:06.059 align:start position:0%
dollars that they would just they would
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
send out a bill and if you go to their
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
website they've actually got a proposal
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
as far as the invoicing for that bill
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
which would be assessed every year on
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
identified manufacturers and
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
Distributors of pharmaceutical products
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you
 
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
uh so do I understand correctly that
 
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
these fees then would be to fund the
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
board's operation rather than funding it
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
through the general fund that's correct
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.580 align:start position:0%

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
an objective or is this just under
 
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
consideration to get started when the
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel are hired yeah thanks for the
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
question yeah the board has been formed
 
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
as representative Edwards pointed out it
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
was formed more than a year ago when
 
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
they've been trying to get themselves
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
organized what brought it to our
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
attention both the representative
 
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
Edwards and I serve on the joint
 
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee and they
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
came before the fiscal committee last
 
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
year looking for an appropriation or for
 
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
us to give them money to establish
 
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
themselves and to pay for an executive
 
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:34.220 align:start position:0%
director and an administrative assistant
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
we started digging further into this
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
after the request we tabled their
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
request and that's when we decided this
 
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:43.820 align:start position:0%
needs a little more oversight and
 
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
scrutiny so that's where that it all
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
came from
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
just to clarify no recommendations have
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
come out of this because there is not a
 
00:21:52.679 --> 00:21:54.250 align:start position:0%
come out of this because there is not a
staff

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:54.260 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
formed yet correct I think they they've
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
probably done some recommendations on
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
their owns but I have not specifically
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
seen them okay thank you to expand on
 
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059 align:start position:0%
that a little bit
 
00:22:09.049 --> 00:22:09.059 align:start position:0%
um so so this board has been constituted
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
the board has some members from the
 
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
legislature that have been appointed
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
into other uh civilians in the industry
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
and they've been meeting and they've uh
 
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
and and I know the leader of that
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I'm sure he's
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
going to testify I know he's been
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
working very very hard to accomplish the
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of of the board but he's had to
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
jump through some hurdles he's had to
 
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
get ready for gel car for example and so
 
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299 align:start position:0%
they've made recommendations to gel car
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
gel car has responded they've come back
 
00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:45.419 align:start position:0%
to address jail car concerns and so so
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
they are actively working but they're
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
doing it with you know part-time
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
legislators and others and so what
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
they're looking to do is to mature to
 
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
the next level people to get an
 
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
executive director and assistant so that
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
they can you know worry the problem on
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any any more questions
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
okay representative Herbert please
 
00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:12.470 align:start position:0%
okay representative Herbert please
um

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
I just want to I've been here what eight
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
years and and I've never suspended a
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
bill that has already been passed
 
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
so it this is news to me I didn't know
 
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
we had the
 
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
we could do that
 
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:28.340 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
and would you believe
 
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
if you haven't given them any money
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's unreasonable to
 
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
expect them to offer you recommendations
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
that are well thought out
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh in the beginning so it's you
 
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
it's to me it's like a a circular
 
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
argument about well I don't want to fund
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
this so therefore and I'm not getting
 
00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
the recommendations and I'm thinking
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
well of course you haven't but it's
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
legislation that we passed
 
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
so I I'm uh I'm I'm a little confused
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
about our what we're actually doing here
 
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.789 align:start position:0%
about our what we're actually doing here
so

00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
so let's let's just assume for the sake
 
00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
of argument that everyone agrees with
 
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the board the board wants
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
to make drugs affordable all right uh
 
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
the the the the the the issue is not
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
whether or not they should spend money
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
the issue is whether or not they should
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
waste money and do things that are
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
redundant and basically are not moving
 
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
us towards the objective and that's the
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
concern and so the legislature has the
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
power to repeal which is my other bill
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
just repeal it outright so certainly the
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
legislature has the power to call a
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
timeout and hold it in advance uh the
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
the statute until we have an opportunity
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
to have the legislative legislature do
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
its duty to ensure that this is not a
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
wasteful redundant program and that it's
 
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
set up for success and and and not just
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
to spin wheels did you have one more
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
yeah perhaps as was mentioned earlier if
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
the process had gone through the normal
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
review like by the Ways and Means
 
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
Committee as far as fees and the expense
 
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
side of it through the finance committee
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be here but because it kind
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
of went through a different process uh
 
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
that's I think why we're here and
 
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
looking for a little pullback to get a
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
better handle on what the board is
 
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
supposed to do and again there isn't
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
redundancy between the department of
 
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
administrative services and the
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
so I just want to get it straight so one
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
bill you want to be repealed entirely
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
is and and that passed as well no you
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
you haven't heard that bill yet I think
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's coming up in Commerce in a I don't
 
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
know your next hearing or two okay so
 
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
and that one you want to kill
 
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm trying to have a conversation
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
with with your committee I I I could
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
easily be convinced to just repeal the
 
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
entire thing and start fresh and use the
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
normal legislative process to figure out
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do I I could do that
 
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
this is my this is our attempt I think
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
to to to have a reasonable conversation
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
without the repeal this is this is the
 
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
less uh aggressive approach to to make
 
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
sure that we're doing the right thing
 
00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:27.740 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
representative uh remind me how to
 
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
pronounce your name I'm sorry
 
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
Julio representative
 
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
given that prescription drug prices is a
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
long-standing problem throughout
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
American politics what do you think is a
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable time frame in which to see
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
drug prices come down with a board such
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
get Rudy um okay so
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
um what I think uh we we want to go back
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
to is that already under statute of the
 
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services is
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
conducting reverse options on
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals and I wish Mr arlinghaus
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully somebody from that department
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
is in here I I've I've heard reported
 
00:27:15.649 --> 00:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
some success in controlling price
 
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:18.059 align:start position:0%
increases through that reverse auction
 
00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:21.419 align:start position:0%
process I'm not prepared to brief it for
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
them but but I've heard success is there
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
also uh in statute we're collecting a
 
00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:30.980 align:start position:0%
lot of this data already uh in the
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Health Information System
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
and so so the data is is there and could
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
be accessed to answer questions that we
 
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
may have and federally there's already
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
in statute Federal Consolidated
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations Act of 2021 and so the
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
efforts legislatively have already begun
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
to shorten the timeline to when we think
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to see positive results
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
again the this board
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
is probably redundant my instinct says
 
00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
this is redundant and let's look at it
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
so so even we accept the goal the same
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
goal we want to reduce drug prices
 
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.110 align:start position:0%
goal we want to reduce drug prices
rapidly

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
rapidly
 
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not convinced this is this board is
 
00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:24.419 align:start position:0%
the right way to go YouTube Follow did
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up
 
00:28:27.529 --> 00:28:27.539 align:start position:0%
I do have a follow-up to return to the
 
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
question that I actually asked what is
 
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
the time frame in which you would expect
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
to see drug prices reduced with a board
 
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
uh I would turn your attention to this
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
report that was issued by the New
 
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department uh back
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
in 2021 and they looked at an 85-page
 
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
report and there's actually been a
 
00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
decline in a number of drug price
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
drivers the thing that's really pushing
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
things up right now are the specialty
 
00:28:59.570 --> 00:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
drugs that are very expensive and often
 
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
insurance companies don't cover but
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's as you probably well know on the
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
this movement right now as far as
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
lowering prescription drug costs is some
 
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
question whether the states even have
 
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
the authority to go down that road since
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
the federal government is already doing
 
00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
it so I think all of us would agree that
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
drug prices need to come down and the
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
whole idea of this board was a good idea
 
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
but again there seems to be a lot of
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
redundancy in what we're trying to do
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
when we're already having it done and
 
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
the review of drug prices by the
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
and the insurance department
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions thank
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
you and um I guess you can get back to
 
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:45.059 align:start position:0%
next up
 
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
next up we'll call uh Jen Delay from
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
and uh it says time needed to speak 30
 
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
seconds but we'll give you a little more
 
00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:08.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
turn your microphone on just red means
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
good yep sorry about that uh good
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
morning committee members uh thank you
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%

affordability board
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
um they have been working
 
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.730 align:start position:0%
um they have been working
um

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal piece and can get into
 
00:30:59.210 --> 00:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
great detail on that with you and answer
 
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
all of your questions
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I also uh wanted to just mention that
 
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
in the 2022 session there were two
 
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
additional uh pieces of legislation on
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug afforded
 
00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
affordability board
 
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
um it was uh one bill was voted on in
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
the executive departments and
 
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.510 align:start position:0%
the executive departments and
administrative

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:31:23.889 --> 00:31:23.899 align:start position:0%
committee that was sent to interim study
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
additionally there was SB 450 which went
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh which passed the uh Senate with a
 
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
unanimous Voice vote and then also
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
um was voted on on the house floor
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
um that was a bill that actually
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
strengthened the prescription drug
 
00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:45.299 align:start position:0%
affordability board and would allow it
 
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:48.539 align:start position:0%
to carry out its duties
 
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
um and so uh from what we have seen
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
this bill has been looked at ins in
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
committee and has been voted on on the
 
00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
floor the prescription drug
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
affordability board it also was signed
 
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
into law in 2020 by the governor with
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
um and AARP is in strong opposition to
 
00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.059 align:start position:0%
anything that would inhibit the
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board in
 
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
uh continuing on their work
 
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
um uh and it is very important I mean
 
00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:27.059 align:start position:0%
people across 85 percent of granite
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
Staters say that uh the cost of
 
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs is one of the most
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
important things to them
 
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
um and anything well we're all for
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
um government transparency and avoiding
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
redundancy we've we believe that the
 
00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:45.380 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
will bring that much needed transparency
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
and help Granite Staters and also help
 
00:32:54.049 --> 00:32:54.059 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
um you know save funds
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
um in you know paying exorbitant costs
 
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
for prescription drugs for the public
 
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.510 align:start position:0%
for prescription drugs for the public
payers

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
payers
 
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you any questions
 
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh you you heard the previous testimony
 
00:33:16.009 --> 00:33:16.019 align:start position:0%
and the claim of redundancy so in in
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
your opposition uh aarp's opposition to
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
um how does redundancy factor into your
 
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
decision-making process do you recognize
 
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
it or do you believe that it is uh not a
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
real issue sure so um when uh the bill
 
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
was enacted
 
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
um from I was not a lobbyist for AARP at
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
that point but from what I understand it
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
was put into place because
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
um despite best efforts of uh the
 
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
insurance New Hampshire Insurance
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
Association and
 
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
um and other state agencies in bringing
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
down the cost of prescription drugs
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
um due to lack of funding and lack of
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
Staffing they weren't able to do that
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
job do that effectively and so that is
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons the board was brought
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
into existence
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Terry any
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
so next we'll call Donald funstein from
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
a hip and he's in support of the bill
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
primary lobbyist for a hip we have been
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
very involved in the operation of this
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
prescription drug board and I'm going to
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
try to touch upon the questions that
 
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:24.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
usually people can hear me there we go
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
there's a audience on YouTube during the
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
21st century I just want to make sure my
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
mother's volume is okay I couldn't you
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
get that now here we
 
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
um this bill
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
was passed two and a half years ago it
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
took effect
 
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
two and a half years ago
 
00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:48.380 align:start position:0%
there are only two states in the nation
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
that have tried this spending Target
 
00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:54.010 align:start position:0%
that have tried this spending Target
experiment

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:54.020 align:start position:0%
experiment
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
established this law in 2019 I believe

June 23rd is the effective date
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire bill is identical
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
to the language that was in Maine it was
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
adopted as the representatives before me
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
explained as a result during the covid
 
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.849 align:start position:0%
explained as a result during the covid
emergency

00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
so as a result of the emergency and not
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
due to anybody's mischief's Behavior
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
the bill never had a hearing in the
 
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.530 align:start position:0%
the bill never had a hearing in the
house

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
an experiment that Maine thought might
 
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
work for Maine and Maine you may know
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
has an income tax the relationship
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
between the state and the municipalities
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
is different than a relationship between
 
00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:52.140 align:start position:0%
the state and the municipalities here in
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's one fundamental
 
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.270 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's one fundamental
difference

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
the experiment in Maine is three and a
 
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
half years old
 
00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:06.740 align:start position:0%
to pick up on some of Representatives
 
00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
filio's questions
 
00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:12.839 align:start position:0%
recommend what has the state of Maine
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
done in three and a half years
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
I looked at the minutes for the last 10
 
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.870 align:start position:0%
I looked at the minutes for the last 10
meetings

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
over three and a half years
 
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.010 align:start position:0%
over three and a half years
they

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
in the fourth quarter or 2022 we're
 
00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
still discussing what their law does
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
they created it we copied it the
 
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
principal component of the bill is the
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
establishment of spending targets
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
for prescription drugs purchased by
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
public payers
 
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
they're still debating
 
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
what that language means
 
00:37:59.329 --> 00:37:59.339 align:start position:0%
the only recommendation that Maine has
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
come up with in three and a half years
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
is they think now it might be a good
 
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
idea to look at some type of reverse PBM
 
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.589 align:start position:0%
idea to look at some type of reverse PBM
auction

00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
auction
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
well New Hampshire as you've heard from
 
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has already
 
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
successfully using that mechanism
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
which is like the board incorporated
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
into our statutes
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
in fact I believe it was the same
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill but I may be wrong about
 
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.030 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill but I may be wrong about
that

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:32.540 align:start position:0%
so with three and a half years in Maine
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
two and a half years in New Hampshire
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
with our
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
adaptation of the main experience and
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
we're all in on representative Edwards
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
and leishman's Bill
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
because it's time now to do it the New
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way
 
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to point out a few
 
00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.069 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to point out a few
observations

00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
observations
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
that we believe firmly support
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
the reason why you should stop and take
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
a look at what's going on
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
the spending Target methodology
 
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
that we are still debating two and a
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
half years down the road
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
and meaning in October 10th
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
2022 of this board
 
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
one hour in 18 minutes into the meeting
 
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
as it is recorded
 
00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the legislation
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
makes a joke about who filed this bill
 
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
when reading
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
the spending Target methodology
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
which was an obvious acknowledgment of
 
00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
you know what does it mean
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
yet at the very next meeting
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
at which the board undertook a
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
substantive review of issues as opposed
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
to Simply voting on the latest iteration
 
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
of their Communications with gel car on
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
they rolled out a budget
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
that now I can respond to representative
 
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.109 align:start position:0%
that now I can respond to representative
Gibbs

00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
Gibbs
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
that is representative Edwards says once
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
the tax the prescription drug channels
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
for over half a million dollars
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
they want to spend a quarter of a
 
00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars on an executive director
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
and an assistant
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
when the meeting before
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
they acknowledge that the principal
 
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
component of their bill
 
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
the spending Target methodology one
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
member wanted to know whether it was a
 
00:40:56.569 --> 00:40:56.579 align:start position:0%
methodology and suggested it shouldn't
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
be the primary response left and wanted
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
to know who filed the bill which of
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
course he did and it was a good natured
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
thing I don't mean to criticize
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
individuals it was all done in this
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
covert pandemic but what's let's let's
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
put the brakes on let's take a look
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
so what do they want to do with the rest
 
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
of the money
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
one of the members of the board
 
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
is a professor
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
and he spent the meeting talking about
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
spending a hundred thousand dollars of
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
the budget they want to raise
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
by hiring his employer
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
to look at Dater
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
and to tell them what their
 
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
responsibility is
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
for fifty thousand dollars develop a
 
00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:48.500 align:start position:0%
methodology to set spending targets
 
00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:52.460 align:start position:0%
now if the member had been
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
associated with Southern New Hampshire
 
00:41:54.599 --> 00:41:56.210 align:start position:0%
associated with Southern New Hampshire
University

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
University
 
00:41:59.569 --> 00:41:59.579 align:start position:0%
would we now be looking at the data
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
once from Southern New Hampshire
 
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
University I don't know
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
I don't I didn't see any proposals I
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
don't know if there was an RFP I don't
 
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
know if anybody talked to anybody
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
now what really is astonishing
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
when you look at that is the fact that
 
00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:23.099 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has on its state employee
 
00:42:23.099 --> 00:42:24.530 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has on its state employee
payroll

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
payroll
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
a PhD Healthcare data professional
 
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
that's actually been following the
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
developments here
 
00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has getting to
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Terry's comments
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
questions concerning do you see
 
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.990 align:start position:0%
questions concerning do you see
redundancy

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
redundancy
 
00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:44.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the professional staff
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
that people want to contract for in tax
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
for or impose assessments is the way the
 
00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:54.380 align:start position:0%
language reads
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
we have the data system New Hampshire
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
has the all pairs
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
Health Care claim data system the
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
prescription drug claims under both
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy benefit and the medical
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
benefit the latter of which includes the
 
00:43:16.809 --> 00:43:16.819 align:start position:0%
real expensive drugs that representative
 
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
Leachman was referring to the specialty
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
farmer drugs we have all that data it's
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
already being collected we have
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
professionals that can analyze it
 
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
those are just two redundancies there
 
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
are others so these are just examples of
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
what why we think it makes a lot of
 
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
sense to slow down and take a look at
 
00:43:47.809 --> 00:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
what's going on and let's stop
 
00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:50.099 align:start position:0%
trying to adapt
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
the experiment in Maine which if you
 
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
read the minutes three and a half years
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
out pretty well has failed and let's
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
look at the New Hampshire way thank you
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
for your patience and I'm happy to
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
you want to speak I guess I'm just going
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
to add um I wanted to also just be clear
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
that From ahib's perspective we very
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
much support lowering prescription drugs
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
and making them affordable for New
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumers whether it's
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
individuals businesses paying the
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
premiums or state payers
 
00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
um paying for the drugs and the premiums
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
our our hope is that we can do that
 
00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively
 
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:40.370 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively
um

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
and in a timely way as well so I just
 
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to to mention that the other
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
thing I was going to mention
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
um Mr funstein mentioned that the kind
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
of central focus of this board is to
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
come up with spending targets
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just read for you what what
 
00:45:00.849 --> 00:45:00.859 align:start position:0%
the the law says
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
the board shall determine annual
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
spending targets for prescription drugs
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
purchased by public payers based upon a
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the medical care services component
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
of the United States Department of Labor
 
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer
 
00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
Price Index Medical Care Services index
 
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
plus a reasonable percentage for
 
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
inflation and minus a spending Target
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
for pharmacy savings as determined by
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
so far no one has been able to figure
 
00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:32.579 align:start position:0%
out what that means it sounds like
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
there's a CPI plus another
 
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.890 align:start position:0%
there's a CPI plus another
um

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
inflation Factor on top of it so
 
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
first of all we're trying to figure out
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
what that even means and other states
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
haven't figured it out either the other
 
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
question is even if we do by some
 
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:51.650 align:start position:0%
question is even if we do by some
um

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
happy happenstance figure out how to do
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
that you know the question is are we
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
coming up with spending targets for each
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
prescription drug are we coming up for
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
spending targets for each prescription
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
drug for each public payer which is the
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
state 10 counties and 200 and some odd
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities and even if we're able to
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
deliver spending targets to the public
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
payers are they going to be able to do
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
anything with those given that many of
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
them have contracts with unions that
 
00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
or you know it's hard to um adjust uh
 
00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:32.339 align:start position:0%
health insurance benefits
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
um when you have a Union contract so I
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
just wanted to be very clear that we
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
very much support the goal as others
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
have said
 
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
um but we just want to make sure that
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
we're not spinning our Wheels as other
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
states have and make sure that we can
 
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
figure out actually how to move forward
 
00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
we're all for transparency around drug
 
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
pricing and in fact greater transparency
 
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
we do think could help put some pressure
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
some downward pressure on pricing so
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
we're very much in support of
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
transparency but we think we can you
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
know there's already other entities
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
working on transparency both at the
 
00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
federal and state level
 
00:47:08.819 --> 00:47:09.470 align:start position:0%
federal and state level
um

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make those points
 
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.430 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
oh represent Gibbs
 
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:23.579 align:start position:0%
um apparently up to this point uh we
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
have provided neither funding nor staff
 
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
to the board considering that
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
would you be open to the idea that it's
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
better to give the board a chance to
 
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
obtain the funding and hire staff and we
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
could we could discuss what the
 
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.530 align:start position:0%
could we could discuss what the
reasonable

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
um uh salary level uh I don't think that
 
00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
that's necessarily controlling
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
um but give it a chance to obtain some
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
funding and hire some staff that would
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
actually allow it to do the work
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
um that the statute proposes for it to
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
do before we decide that it's impossible
 
00:48:10.809 --> 00:48:10.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
this would be sure what else it would be
 
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's a good investment
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh particularly after
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
a acknowledgment
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
that the primary principle
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
of the law
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
is in my words anyways nonsensical it
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be redone
 
00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:34.670 align:start position:0%
needs to be redone
um

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know anyone that successfully
 
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
can run a business
 
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
that will raise capital
 
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
for something
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
they have no idea what they're going to
 
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
do with it
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:56.300 align:start position:0%
but but we have no no app no business
 
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
plan the fundamental component of the
 
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
existing war is the spending Target
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
methodology nobody knows what it means
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
the people that wrote it originally
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
three and a half years ago don't know
 
00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:11.099 align:start position:0%
what it means
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
and that's why at the meeting of October
 
00:49:15.359 --> 00:49:17.210 align:start position:0%
and that's why at the meeting of October
10th

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
10th
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know the prime sponsor basically
 
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
said to representative Edwards who was
 
00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
in the audience
 
00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
you know I guess we're going to have to
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
I would just in in addition to that
 
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
response I would say that you know as
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
you've heard hopefully from us in the
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
prior testimony
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
um we do think that a lot of this work
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
either is already be done or could be
 
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
done within the department of
 
00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:44.339 align:start position:0%
administrative Services the New
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department and HHS
 
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
and so I think it would be reasonable to
 
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
see what is already being done there and
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's already built into those agencies
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
budgets now maybe there needs to be some
 
00:49:57.359 --> 00:49:58.730 align:start position:0%
budgets now maybe there needs to be some
enhancement

00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
enhancement
 
00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.109 align:start position:0%
enhancement
um

00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
but would it you know would the
 
00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
enhancements need to be you know north
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
of a half a million dollars I don't know
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
um but again I I do think uh the other
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
piece of it is this idea of a spending
 
00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:14.339 align:start position:0%
Target is just
 
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
kind of impossible to wrap your head
 
00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.210 align:start position:0%
kind of impossible to wrap your head
around

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
um originally it came from there was
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
model legislation it was not a spending
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
Target it was price setting and even
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
Maine recognized that they couldn't get
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
away with price setting so they turned
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
it into a spending Target
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
um but it the language really even if
 
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
you hire my point is even if you give
 
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
the money allow the board to assess fees
 
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
and collect money and hire an executive
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
director and Staffing
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that the executive
 
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
director and the staff are going to have
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
any easier of a time understanding what
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
this means and even if they could figure
 
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
out what it means and they do come up
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
with spending targets to my other point
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the public payers are
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to do with those spending
 
00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.309 align:start position:0%
supposed to do with those spending
targets

00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
targets
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
great oh representative Philip
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
if the issue here then is we have an
 
00:51:09.049 --> 00:51:09.059 align:start position:0%
indecipherable statute and to be clear
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
the work of lawyers administrators and
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
judges is to decipher indecipherable
 
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.630 align:start position:0%
judges is to decipher indecipherable
statutes

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
when it's an equal fix to just be for
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
the legislature to make this statute
 
00:51:21.049 --> 00:51:21.059 align:start position:0%
clearer rather than to throw out the
 
00:51:21.059 --> 00:51:26.510 align:start position:0%
clearer rather than to throw out the
board

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.069 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
I mean if Maine created the statute
 
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
three and a half years ago and they're
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
still debating what it means and haven't
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
done anything in three and a half years
 
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
why would you try to build as I said
 
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
in one of our the meeting of October
 
00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.690 align:start position:0%
in one of our the meeting of October
10th

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
10th
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
why would you build a house on a
 
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:56.579 align:start position:0%
are too expensive right now
 
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much
 
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh chair will call on Tom Sherman
 
00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:05.819 align:start position:0%
who is in opposition to the bill
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
and I bet you you were in the room when
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
and Gary merchant do you want to speak

00:52:45.049 --> 00:52:45.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.809 --> 00:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for the
 
00:52:53.819 --> 00:52:54.770 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for the
committee

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Gary Merchant
 
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
representing Sullivan County district 6
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
which is Claremont Croydon I also chair
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug affordability
 
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
board which seems to be a Hot Topic this
 
00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:09.710 align:start position:0%
board which seems to be a Hot Topic this
morning

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
before I get into trying to explain the
 
00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:14.990 align:start position:0%
before I get into trying to explain the
board

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
is trying to help people understand and
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
you can relate to this because you had a
 
00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
previous bill you heard from the setting
 
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
a Mac price
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
and how challenging it is for a retail
 
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.049 align:start position:0%
and how challenging it is for a retail
pharmacy

00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:27.059 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
that's only a tip of the iceberg
 
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
when you start looking at the pharmacy
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
this is how complex it is how
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
convoluted it is it's not
 
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.430 align:start position:0%
convoluted it is it's not
straightforward

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
and part of that is because it lacks
 
00:53:51.839 --> 00:53:57.049 align:start position:0%
and part of that is because it lacks
transparency

00:53:57.049 --> 00:53:57.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
the reason why it lacks transparency
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
because most people in the pharmacy
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
supply chain benefit from
 
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
the lack of transparency
 
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
they will fight any effort to bring
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:15.059 align:start position:0%
now a couple of things were said this
 
00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:18.839 align:start position:0%
morning I'd like to clarify or at least
 
00:54:18.839 --> 00:54:20.569 align:start position:0%
morning I'd like to clarify or at least
counter

00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:20.579 align:start position:0%
counter
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
one regards to the executive director
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
the 165 thousand dollars is fully loaded
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
the actual salary is 118.
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
and has to be said by
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
The Joint Commission an employee
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
compensation so we don't actually know
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
where it's going to be said
 
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
through its Consultants will set it
 
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
appropriately depending upon the market
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
35 to 40 000 is called benefits
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
but we pay in Social Security will we
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
pay in health care dental benefits Etc
 
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
the same thing with the administrative
 
00:54:59.339 --> 00:55:01.370 align:start position:0%
the same thing with the administrative
assistant

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
it's only a level two folks
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
get somebody to help with the paperwork
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure the office is running
 
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.609 align:start position:0%
to make sure the office is running
accordingly

00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:17.099 align:start position:0%
specialty drugs we did listen to that
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
initially we wanted to focus our
 
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
attention on
 
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
the drugs in the pharmacy benefit
 
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
Channel because the data was more robust
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
and was rich
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
but after listening to
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
we recognize that specialist drugs
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
according to the insurance department
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
was elect was a Lion's Share not Lion
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
Share but a large part of it and we
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
needed to include it and the board
 
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.530 align:start position:0%
needed to include it and the board
changed

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
it changes direction we listened and we
 
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.569 align:start position:0%
it changes direction we listened and we
responded

00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:47.579 align:start position:0%
responded
 
00:55:50.329 --> 00:55:50.339 align:start position:0%
as far as transparency
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
every single meeting we have is open to
 
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
the public it's recorded all of you can
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
go online and listen to it
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
it's virtual you don't even have to be
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
there in person we wanted it to be
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
totally transparent
 
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
all the minutes
 
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
all the documentation by law
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
have to be published seven days before
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
the meeting occurs can you think of your
 
00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:20.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
I wish I could say it was my mother but
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
in we are required by law by the statue
 
00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:31.140 align:start position:0%
itself to post all the documents that we
 
00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:32.150 align:start position:0%
itself to post all the documents that we
share

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.950 align:start position:0%
share
publicly

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
seven days before we actually review
 
00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:38.579 align:start position:0%
them at the board level that's how much
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
we take transparency it's hard to hold
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
other people accountable to transparency
 
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
in regards to levies on pharmacies
 
00:56:55.609 --> 00:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
there's levees on pbms like Caremark
 
00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.010 align:start position:0%
there's levees on pbms like Caremark

by the way the insurance or the

pharmaceutical Market the United States
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
is over 500 million dollars they have

the billion dollars
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
back to the issue of not having
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
reports to share with you folks we have
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%

00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
than glad to send them to you
 
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
we've struggled because of lack of
 
00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:30.530 align:start position:0%
we've struggled because of lack of
funding

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:32.339 align:start position:0%
we don't have the resources to
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
accomplish what the law was set out to
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
do we have been struggling through this
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
whole process
 
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:39.500 align:start position:0%
trying to get the board up and running
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
including through gel car getting the
 
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
rules written
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
it's a long process without having
 
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate staff and relying upon
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
the good nature of volunteers
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
none of this work would have
 
00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.730 align:start position:0%
none of this work would have
accomplished

00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
accomplished
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
with regards to the insurance department
 
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
they do provide an annual report
 
00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
it tells us
 
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
the key to it is trying to understand
 
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
why why are drugs going up not just
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
reporting the fact that they went up we
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
all know that every time you go to the
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
pharmacy you know that
 
00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
but why is it going up
 
00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
where's the money being made in the
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacy supply chain who's making the
 
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.410 align:start position:0%
pharmacy supply chain who's making the
money

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.849 --> 00:58:30.859 align:start position:0%
get all this
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
Pharma used to have approximately 80
 
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
percent of the profit or the dollar it
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
in 2021 it was less than 50 50 cents on
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
a dollar
 
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
so if they're not making the money who's
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
making it
 
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
should we find out
 
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
we're talking about hard earned taxpayer
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
dollars this is in the public domain
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
this is not in private
 
00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
we as legislators are responsible on how
 
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
we spend taxpayer dollars should we not
 
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
try to figure out and solve the problem
 
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
to use those monies wisely and
 
00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:12.890 align:start position:0%
to use those monies wisely and
appropriately

00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.150 align:start position:0%
in regards to
Maine

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
I talked to Noah I can't think it was Dr
 
00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:21.829 align:start position:0%
I talked to Noah I can't think it was Dr
Noah

00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
Noah
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
they're wrestling with the same thing
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
states have passed similar legislation
 
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
and they struggle because a lot of times
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
the comment about Dr Woodward being a
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
retired UNH Professor he is
 
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
he's very proud of it I think we should
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
too he's from our State University
 
00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.410 align:start position:0%
too he's from our State University
flagship

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
flagship
 
00:59:48.829 --> 00:59:48.839 align:start position:0%
do you realize that UNH has a contract
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health and Human
 
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
Services to do analysis
 
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
all he was saying was to build off from
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
that contract why create another one
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:06.299 align:start position:0%
in regards to Dr Jason ezzy he is
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
with the insurance department he does
 
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
have a PhD
 
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
he also has a full-time job
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
I think he has a full-time job assuming
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
that's why they hired him
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
so if he has a full-time job how is he
 
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
going to do the role we're talking about
 
01:00:20.099 --> 01:00:21.530 align:start position:0%
going to do the role we're talking about
here

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
so in closing looking at things with you
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
folks the primary goal of the board is
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
to try to begin to unravel and provide
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
more transparency to the marketplace
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
we need a competitive Marketplace
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
lacking competition
 
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
prices don't go down
 
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
so the question we need to do in this
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
legislative body and through the board
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
is to understand why
 
01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
it's the why so all we're asking for is
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
don't repeal the board don't put it on
 
01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.609 align:start position:0%
don't repeal the board don't put it on
ice

01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
ice
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
if you're looking for your Dynasty I
 
01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
don't think there's redundancy because
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
no other
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
entity in the state is tasked with what
 
01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
we're tasked with
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
so that's my my comments for you folks
 
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.870 align:start position:0%
so that's my my comments for you folks
today

01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.190 align:start position:0%
today
um

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
any other thing as far as another confu
 
01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:21.059 align:start position:0%
another confusion the board does not
 
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
regulate Price Books it does not it
 
01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.170 align:start position:0%
regulate Price Books it does not it
cannot

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
federally it cannot
 
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
it's a red flag
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
what the board can try to do is help
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
people understand
 
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
when they're spending more money on
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
drugs than they should
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
and then for them to ask the question
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
why we need to find a way to educate
 
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
people on how this thing works so thank
 
01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.470 align:start position:0%
people on how this thing works so thank
you

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%

representative aside I am the prime
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill and I do have a
 
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
sense of humor and it's nice to see it
 
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
used against me and in public forum but
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%

uh so
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here though really to talk about the
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
board and this bill
 
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.190 align:start position:0%
board and this bill
um

01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
this bill puts the board on ice for a
 
01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.130 align:start position:0%
this bill puts the board on ice for a
year

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
year
um and

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
there are several reasons for that but
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
going back to where this bill came from
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh as state senator representing
 
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
District 24. I was Prime sponsor of SB
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
687 uh in 2020. this was introduced and
 
01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
heard in the senate in January of 2020
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
before the covid crisis hit New
 
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.089 align:start position:0%
before the covid crisis hit New
Hampshire

01:02:58.089 --> 01:02:58.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
and due to the pandemic after clearing
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
the Senate it was incorporated as one of
 
01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:06.260 align:start position:0%
several prescription
 
01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
related or Pharmacy related bills
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
including the reverse auction bill which
 
01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:12.980 align:start position:0%
I was a co-sponsor of
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
into HB 1280 as an amendment
 
01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.250 align:start position:0%
into HB 1280 as an amendment
um

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
the bill made changes in the statute uh
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:03:28.609 --> 01:03:28.619 align:start position:0%
we also last session introduced SB 450
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
and I was Prime sponsor of that bill
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
SB 450 was in response to the initial
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
meetings of the board and recognizing
 
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
that there were several areas that
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
needed to be upgraded or amended or
 
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
changed and how the board was structured
 
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:48.230 align:start position:0%
changed and how the board was structured
um

01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
how we limited fees
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
how we limited our budget these were all
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
brought forward by people like
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative leishman by ahip by
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
others and we were trying to respond to
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
that and adjust the board accordingly
 
01:04:09.289 --> 01:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
because we thought there was Merit to
 
01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
SB 450 did have a house hearing
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
it had a senate hearing it passed both
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
Chambers and was signed into law by the
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
governor so the notion that this board
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
has never had a full Hearing in the
 
01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:30.380 align:start position:0%
house is just false patently
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
and the house and the Senate
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
moved it forward with SB 450.
 
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
moved it forward with SB 450.
um

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:39.310 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:41.270 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
so SB I'm sorry HB 172
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
has been introduced
 
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe the findings that
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
are listed in the bill are supported by
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.349 align:start position:0%
are listed in the bill are supported by
fact

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire drug affordability
 
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
board prescription drug affordability
 
01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:00.380 align:start position:0%
board which we call pdab
 
01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh without the benefit of full
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
legislative review I just addressed that
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
it has had subsequent hearings in the
 
01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:11.339 align:start position:0%
house on at least two occasions uh and
 
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
the house went ahead and moved the pdab
 
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.210 align:start position:0%
the house went ahead and moved the pdab
forward

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
the second finding was that recognized
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
that there were a high costs of
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs
 
01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:29.339 align:start position:0%
but uh said that this was identical to
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
the main law
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
it wasn't identical to the main law it
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
was adapted to as was previously stated
 
01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire way as best as I and
 
01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:41.579 align:start position:0%
others the AARP new Futures and other
 
01:05:41.579 --> 01:05:42.849 align:start position:0%
others the AARP new Futures and other
supporters

01:05:42.849 --> 01:05:42.859 align:start position:0%
supporters
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
knew to do
 
01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.910 align:start position:0%
knew to do
but

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
it has been further modified just like
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
was suggested right here in today's
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
discussion and it will continue to be
 
01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.289 align:start position:0%
discussion and it will continue to be
modified

01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:57.299 align:start position:0%
modified
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
the overarching goal here is to
 
01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
understand the prescription drug Market
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
as it impacts State cost
 
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
and to do everything we possibly can to
 
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
identify strategies for lowering that
 
01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
cost that
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
not the sentence that Mr fundstein
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
brought forward is the principal goal of
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
this and if we need to change which is
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
where my quip came from if we need to
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
change how we do that
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
we have legislative oversight we have
 
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
several legislators on board we have
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
already come back to the legislature for
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
modifications and we can certainly do
 
01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
that if we need to
 
01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:38.660 align:start position:0%
and as an aside the idea that
 
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
UNH currently has a contract that
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
provides much of the data we need
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't go ahead and utilize
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
that but we should use a different
 
01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:50.660 align:start position:0%
entity that would require
 
01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
completely new contract is redundant and
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
we're trying to avoid that redundancy
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
finding number three
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
we created redundancies
 
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
honestly there is no entity in the state
 
01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire right now that does
 
01:07:12.049 --> 01:07:12.059 align:start position:0%
what pdab is trying to do
 
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
we are trying to make sure we fully
 
01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:17.579 align:start position:0%
understand the drug market and provide
 
01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
strategies for lowering costs for the
 
01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the State of New Hampshire
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
that does not exist
 
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
but there are people in different
 
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
positions including Jason and including
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
in Department of administrative services
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
and Department of Health and Human
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
Services and UNH and Dartmouth that
 
01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
actually have resources that the board
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
can tap into to achieve its goal
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
and that's the role of the goal of the
 
01:07:46.319 --> 01:07:47.450 align:start position:0%
and that's the role of the goal of the
board

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
we've spent the last two and a half
 
01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.270 align:start position:0%
we've spent the last two and a half
years

01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
really and my hats off to representative
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
Merchant he's done a phenomenal job we
 
01:07:57.770 --> 01:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
are leading the effort in the country on
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
this and it is no surprise that the
 
01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
people who are asked to pay fees and the
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
people who might feel threatened by the
 
01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
existence of the board would come before
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
you and try to kill it
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
but we're here to serve the people of
 
01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:15.299 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
we're here to provide that transparency
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
that currently does not exist
 
01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
and for which there is no mechanism to
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
do so in spite of what this bill claims
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
section two and three of the bill
 
01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:31.140 align:start position:0%
require unnecessary and burdensome
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
investigation I thought our goal is to
 
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
decrease the work of the government this
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
board is
 
01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
not increasing the work of the
 
01:08:42.249 --> 01:08:42.259 align:start position:0%
government it's using actual
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
data and resources already available
 
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
coordinating them and coming up with a
 
01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
strategy to move forward
 
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
can you imagine suspending the board and
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
then asking three different departments
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
to investigate whether the board is
 
01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.390 align:start position:0%
to investigate whether the board is
redundant

01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
I mean that speaks for itself and
 
01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.510 align:start position:0%
I mean that speaks for itself and
finally

01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:05.900 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement that the
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
oversight committee out of Da out of the
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
committee on Health and Human Services
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
that the law is required to
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
ask the oversight committee to provide
 
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
oversight over the board
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
they already have that Authority
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
we are statutorily attached to DHHS
 
01:09:30.169 --> 01:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
and that's what the oversight board
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
is designed to oversee
 
01:09:36.769 --> 01:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
so that's not even necessary it doesn't
 
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
need to be in statute they can already
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
do it and we'd be happy to work with
 
01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.110 align:start position:0%
do it and we'd be happy to work with
them

01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
the part that to me is a little
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
disingenuous is that we have worked with
 
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
this bill's sponsor
 
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
over and over we've had public session
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
during and aside from the actual
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
pdab meetings
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
and yet this session
 
01:10:01.199 --> 01:10:03.169 align:start position:0%
and yet this session
again

01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
there are two bills designed to torpedo
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
and repeal pdab so the state of New
 
01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.410 align:start position:0%
and repeal pdab so the state of New
Hampshire

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
with millions of dollars
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
of cost for prescription drugs will
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
remain in the dark and the Black Box
 
01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
around these expenses
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
as a physician my highest priority has
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
always been to advocate for the health
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
of my patients
 
01:10:32.689 --> 01:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs have always been a
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
critical component of the provision of
 
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate care
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
as a provider I have had to have a full
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of their efficacy side
 
01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.330 align:start position:0%
understanding of their efficacy side
effects

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
effects
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
and even their financial impact on my
 
01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.130 align:start position:0%
and even their financial impact on my
patients

01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
in a similar vein the role of pdab
 
01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
is not based on a single sentence that
 
01:10:58.850 --> 01:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
may need to be modified
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
the role of pdab is to ensure that the
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire has done
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
everything possible
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
to fully understand the extremely
 
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
complex prescription drug Marketplace
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
and cost structure in order to ensure
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
that patients covered by the state and
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County programs have
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
access to the medications they need at
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
the lowest possible cost
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
that makes sense that's common sense and
 
01:11:29.689 --> 01:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
by the way this was never
 
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
a partisan bill
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
neither of my bills that I've filed
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
we're a Democrat or a Republican bill
 
01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
they had bipartisan sponsorship and
 
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
strong support in the Senate and the
 
01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:46.370 align:start position:0%
strong support in the Senate and the
house

01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
we have all watched as prescription drug
 
01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:51.500 align:start position:0%
prices continue to Skyrocket
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
representing a significant and Rising
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal burden to patients municipalities
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
into the state
 
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
HB 172 will effectively eliminate
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
the only tool
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
that we have to fully understand why
 
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
this is happening and how we might
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
mitigate its impact
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
I asked you to itl this bill
 
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
and to allow the prescription drug
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
affordability board to continue its work
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
with transparency
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the people of New Hampshire
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm happy to take questions
 
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
uh we do have questions representative
 
01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.410 align:start position:0%
uh we do have questions representative
Burroughs

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
Burroughs
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks uh thanks for taking my
 
01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
question Dr Sherman good to see you
 
01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:39.050 align:start position:0%
question Dr Sherman good to see you
um

01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
you say the board's been in it has been
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
going for two and a half years is that
 
01:12:45.649 --> 01:12:45.659 align:start position:0%
right yes can you can you tell us about
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
what you feel has been accomplished or
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
how you're getting to the goal from the
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
past two and a half years
 
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
well yeah
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's you know for somebody who likes to
 
01:12:59.209 --> 01:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
get things done yesterday this has been
 
01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:02.300 align:start position:0%
an exercise in
 
01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
incredible patience
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
um we have moved forward the the
 
01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
approach to fiscal last year and and
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant can speak to
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
this as well came from the fact that you
 
01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
know what's the horse and what's the
 
01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:18.590 align:start position:0%
know what's the horse and what's the
cart

01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
cart
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
we need funding to hire an executive
 
01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.610 align:start position:0%
we need funding to hire an executive
director

01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
but we need an executive director
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
to move forward with our fee structure
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
and our budget
 
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
and what we realized is that
 
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
not only did we take pretty much the
 
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
first year to bring the entire board up
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
to Snuff on the complexity of this
 
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
system and by the way I'd recommend
 
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
people actually go back and look at some
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
of those if you've ever wondered what a
 
01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:50.780 align:start position:0%
PBM is how insurers work how
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals price all of these
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
things were covered in the first six to
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
12 months
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
then we've gone through the rulemaking
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
process which is onerous and you know
 
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
for good reason this has to be done
 
01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
properly we also realize that in the
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
original Bill we had the wrong
 
01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
classification for the executive
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
director we had to go through that
 
01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:15.860 align:start position:0%
process of reclassifying
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
changing the classification of the
 
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
so there were things in the construction
 
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:14:26.689 --> 01:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
board that I did not anticipate as Prime
 
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
sponsor and that learning curve has been
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
occurring over the last two and a half
 
01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:32.420 align:start position:0%
years requiring further legislation
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
requiring rules going back and forth to
 
01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.229 align:start position:0%
requiring rules going back and forth to
fiscal

01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
with the budget we are poised to start
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
the data collection
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
and the data collection is both from the
 
01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:51.780 align:start position:0%
entities that we are asking to work with
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
and some of it is proprietary so it has
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
to remain confidential we tightened the
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
accountability on board members for that
 
01:14:59.159 --> 01:15:00.790 align:start position:0%
accountability on board members for that
confidentiality

01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
at the request of Pharma and at the
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
request of ahip we have adjusted much of
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
what we do at the request and on based
 
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
on the input of a hip
 
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
um and so we are really listening and
 
01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
responding and finally we're at a point
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
where we can start Gathering that data
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
but again trying to avoid increased cost
 
01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
avoid redundancy
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
we recognize that UNH even though
 
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh one of our board members is from UNH
 
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
is a professor there UNH actually
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
through the College of Health and Human
 
01:15:42.649 --> 01:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
Services has the data that would be very
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
helpful Dartmouth also has it so we're
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
not exclusive
 
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
working with UNH and understanding
 
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
normally that would be the role of the
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
executive director but we don't have one
 
01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
so we're doing it and representative
 
01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
Merchant has been very good at divvying
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
up the burden so that each of us on a
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis is trying to fill that
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
role until we have the ability to hire
 
01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
and assign that role to our executive
 
01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.570 align:start position:0%
and assign that role to our executive
director

01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
the point is that right now we feel
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
poised to start Gathering data
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out by Mr fundstein and
 
01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
Heidi there is a question about whether
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
the metric that we identified originally
 
01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
in the original bill is the most
 
01:16:32.209 --> 01:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
appropriate metric for understanding
 
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
cost and how is it applied that's part
 
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
of the deliberations of the board
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
we still completely understand our
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
mission which is to lower cost
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
if possible to make recommendations on
 
01:16:48.530 --> 01:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
strategies to lower costs for
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs for the people of New
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the taxpayers of New
 
01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.610 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the taxpayers of New
Hampshire

01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's our goal
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
whether we have to make further
 
01:16:58.850 --> 01:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
adjustments in the actual metrics we use
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
to achieve that goal
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's something we talk about every
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
time as you can tell from the prior
 
01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.290 align:start position:0%
time as you can tell from the prior
testimony

01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:06.300 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean
 
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
that we should stop the process
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
Maine is a is a different state it has a
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
completely different process ours has
 
01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.550 align:start position:0%
completely different process ours has
been

01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
incredible for me personally I thought I
 
01:17:23.689 --> 01:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
knew a lot about prescription drug
 
01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
pricing and cost
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's been a very steep learning curve
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
but there is no redundancy there is no
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
other place in the state of New
 
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where
 
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
there is a charge to actually look at
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
all these costs unmask the Black Box
 
01:17:45.649 --> 01:17:45.659 align:start position:0%
understand what the price driver what
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
the cost drivers are and then come up
 
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
with strategies that allow patients to
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead and get the meds they need at
 
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
the lowest possible cost of the state
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up quick follow-up I'll
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
make it further question I'm sure you'll
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
make it quickly
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
so okay Dr Sherman would you if this
 
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
board was put on Ice which is is what
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
the what seems to be what the the goal
 
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
is how would that impact the commission
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
would the all this data I mean all this
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
work be basically be fleshed out to see
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
what's your what's your take
 
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
um you know the the work that we've done
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
would be archived I assume
 
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:26.450 align:start position:0%
would be archived I assume
um

01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
if the legislature chose to
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
unsuspend I mean the suspension goes
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
until June 2024
 
01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:38.699 align:start position:0%
it you know these things are very fluid
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
um changes in the prescription drug
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
market and in cost drivers change
 
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.750 align:start position:0%
market and in cost drivers change
rapidly

01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
rapidly
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
as you've heard there's Federal
 
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
legislation but there's no federal
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
equivalent to this board especially
 
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
focused on taxpayers of New Hampshire
 
01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.010 align:start position:0%
focused on taxpayers of New Hampshire
so

01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
I I can't tell you what would happen but
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
I can tell you because the law requires
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
it I would have more free time
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
um we would be done the work would not
 
01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:09.770 align:start position:0%
um we would be done the work would not
continue

01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's a that's a huge
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
um just got a card in from the New
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department DJ
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
Bettencourt and Jason Dexter two minutes
 
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
they do not take a position on the bill
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
but they do feel obligated to in Parts
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
committee it is in fact true uh well
 
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
first for the record uh DJ Bettencourt
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:48.659 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'm joined by Jason Dexter who is the
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
head of our life and health unit it is
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
in fact true that we did not intend to
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
speak initially
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
but throughout the course of the
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
testimony we were invoked so many times
 
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
and both supporters and opponents of the
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
bill were asking why we weren't going to
 
01:20:08.689 --> 01:20:08.699 align:start position:0%
testify and we just couldn't disappoint
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
our loyal fans any longer so thank you
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
so first and foremost the
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
department is always happy to do the
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
work that is given to us by the
 
01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
legislature so if the legislature this
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
committee and others would like us to
 
01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
take up this work we will of course do
 
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
that work we do have a member of our
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
department on the pdab board and we are
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
kept abreast of their deliberations and
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that service
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
I did want to share before I turn it
 
01:20:41.689 --> 01:20:41.699 align:start position:0%
over to Jason that the New Hampshire
 
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
insurance department has a long-standing
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
commitment to transparency and that
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
includes the prescription drug space
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
I don't recall if we got around to this
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
when we had our orientation with you but
 
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
the department is very very proud of its
 
01:20:58.490 --> 01:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
Health cost website so the health cost
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
website takes all of the list prices for
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
procedures across the state of New
 
01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and allows consumers to plug
 
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
in their particular insurance coverage
 
01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
and then create a geographic region
 
01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
around wherever they are depending on
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
how far they're willing to travel it
 
01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
will give them prices that they can
 
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
consider so that they can perhaps choose
 
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
a provider that gives a lower cost than
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
another provider and we are looking to
 
01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
expand that effort into prescription
 
01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
drugs for a long time we were looking
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
very seriously at expanding
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
that effort to prescription drug
 
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
formularies unfortunately our life and
 
01:21:43.209 --> 01:21:43.219 align:start position:0%
health actuary decided to retire on us
 
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
and so that work
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
um is on hold for now until we can find
 
01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
a replacement for him if any of you know
 
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
any good actuaries please do send them
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
our way
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
but in the absence of that we are
 
01:22:01.729 --> 01:22:01.739 align:start position:0%
looking to add high cost drugs to our
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
health cost website and then hopefully
 
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to expand that later
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned earlier I believe the
 
01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
department has in the past looked into
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs and cost drivers and
 
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
that was the subject of a portion of our
 
01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
annual hearing report back in 2021 I
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
believe it was
 
01:22:25.130 --> 01:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
and so we do look at this very very
 
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
seriously and on a regular basis you
 
01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
know as it pertains to pdab the ultimate
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
choice of what you want to do as a
 
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
policy decision and that is entirely up
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
to you as the policy makers but there
 
01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
are complexities and some considerations
 
01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
that I think are worthy to consider as
 
01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
you deliberate and Jason's going to get
 
01:22:48.169 --> 01:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
into some of those
 
01:22:48.179 --> 01:22:49.790 align:start position:0%
into some of those
foreign

01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:22:51.649 --> 01:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
thank you DJ
 
01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you for having me today Jason
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
Dexter director of Life and Health New
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department I oversee
 
01:23:00.970 --> 01:23:00.980 align:start position:0%
a few units one is the healthcare
 
01:23:03.169 --> 01:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
analytics unit the other is the market
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
regulation unit Dr as is uh is the head
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
right now of the healthcare analytics
 
01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.290 align:start position:0%
right now of the healthcare analytics
unit

01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:11.300 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that's been I think
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned a few times is we have
 
01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority over carriers who
 
01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
have these relationships and contracts
 
01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
with pbms which are ultimately managing
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
something on their behalf we collect
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
data either through a market regulation
 
01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
process or through our chis
 
01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Health Insurance system I
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
forget what just stands for but we
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
collect a lot of data but the reality
 
01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
for us is that information that the
 
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
carrier and that Contracting with that
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
PBM is we're not able to give out it is
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
proprietary trade secret contracts that
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
we can't give that secret sauce that
 
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
explains where that money is moving it's
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
not something we can do both the chis
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
regulations make that clear that we have
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
to be protective of that in a market
 
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
regulation when we're doing Market
 
01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:14.219 align:start position:0%
conduct exam that information is the
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
exam work is confidential
 
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
so that inhibits our ability to explain
 
01:24:22.209 --> 01:24:22.219 align:start position:0%
it at that level
 
01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
as DJ mentioned we we collect
 
01:24:26.930 --> 01:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
information at the behest of the
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
legislature we collect information on
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
what carriers are doing with rebates
 
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
they have to file and attestation saying
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
we send our rebates are flowed back into
 
01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
premium or something else there's a
 
01:24:40.930 --> 01:24:40.940 align:start position:0%
statute on that that we adhere to
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
there's another where we collect
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
information from
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturers about high-cost drugs that
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
information we post on a website which
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
gives us the ability to as DJ mentioned
 
01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
potentially add that to our health cost
 
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
page so that information is available so
 
01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
if there's additional
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
information that can flow through us
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
we're happy to do it the primary concern
 
01:25:11.090 --> 01:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
being the confidentiality
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
how did you take questions
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
uh when we have the bill that you
 
01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
referred to last time so you came in and
 
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
and spoke to us
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh we also had we were looking at the
 
01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
drug prices and I found this picture
 
01:25:32.689 --> 01:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
online this exact one and then I said to
 
01:25:32.699 --> 01:25:34.370 align:start position:0%
online this exact one and then I said to
myself

01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
follow the money and I found out how
 
01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
pbms make their money
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly I was appalled because
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
they make their money at the expense
 
01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:47.719 align:start position:0%
they negotiate with uh
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
make sure you're focusing on a question
 
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.530 --> 01:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
so the fact that there is absolutely no
 
01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
transparency in that process as a buyer
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
of drugs upon occasion was really
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
appalling what Dr Sherman and uh
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant were talking
 
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
about was opening up some of that
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
transparency because otherwise how would
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
you get to that and you're saying that
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
you cannot get to that is is that what
 
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:20.930 align:start position:0%
you're saying
yes

01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
and they will not be able to either
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think so interesting thank you
 
01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:31.550 align:start position:0%
I don't think so interesting thank you
foreign

01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh the chair will call on Jake Berry
 
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman honorable
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Jake
 
01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
Ferry I'm the vice president of policy
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
and new Futures as many of you know new
 
01:27:01.490 --> 01:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
Futures is a nonpartisan non-profit
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
Health policy and advocacy organization
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
we work to ensure access to quality
 
01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
affordable health care for all Granite
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
Staters I don't want to repeat too much
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
of what's been said here this morning I
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
think we've all been here long enough
 
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
but I do want to stress new Futures
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to this bill certainly
 
01:27:17.689 --> 01:27:17.699 align:start position:0%
we don't have an issue with exploring
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
redundancies and looking into maximize
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
efficiency and cost savings but we're
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the piece of this
 
01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
bill that would suspend the activity of
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
the p of the pdap uh we believe strongly
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
that pdab plays an important role
 
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
helping the state set spending targets
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
and identify strategies to address
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
Rising drug costs and for the health of
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
our state we believe that it must uh be
 
01:27:40.729 --> 01:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
allowed to continue to do its work
 
01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned earlier uh that drug
 
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
prices are are that certain drug prices
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
are coming down I would ask if anybody
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
in this room feels that drug prices are
 
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
where they need to be
 
01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:52.570 align:start position:0%
where they need to be
um

01:27:52.570 --> 01:27:52.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
and believe it can everybody you know
 
01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
can all of us access the pictures the
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs that we need at the
 
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
pre at an affordable price point I would
 
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
certainly think not people are still
 
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
unable to afford their prescription
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
drugs people are still rationing their
 
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
medications people are still skipping
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
their medications entirely and the cost
 
01:28:13.729 --> 01:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
you know the the human cost of that the
 
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
cost that adds to our Health Care system
 
01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
are our uh are immeasurable uh so
 
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
certainly uh as I said yeah you know
 
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
simply put Rising drugs Rising drug
 
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
costs are impacting the health of our
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
friends and our neighbors across the
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
state it's critical that we do all that
 
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
we can to support the pdab to help to
 
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
allow to continue it to do its work to
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
help address these issues rather than
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
enforcing it to stop to suspend the pdab
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
at this point would be unfortunate and
 
01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
misguided and would really undercut our
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
ability to address this uh this
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
Healthcare crisis of affordable drug
 
01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
costs with that I'm happy to take any
 
01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:50.270 align:start position:0%
costs with that I'm happy to take any
questions

01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%

01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
I like competition but not in all cases
 
01:30:31.129 --> 01:30:31.139 align:start position:0%
um so uh bring before you uh House Bill

extremely knowledgeable about the system
 
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
which is currently in use in the state
 
01:30:56.530 --> 01:30:56.540 align:start position:0%
of Maryland so this is not a New Concept
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
it has been looked at by several States
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
and is being used very successfully in
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
the state of Maryland and so I will
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%

and you're likely hearing from
constituents

01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
and certainly from many doctors that
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
Health Care in New Hampshire is in
 
01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.169 align:start position:0%
Health Care in New Hampshire is in
trouble

01:32:45.169 --> 01:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
I've been here for 40 years I have never
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
seen it like it is right now
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
I'm a Vanishing breed I'm a primary care
 
01:32:53.159 --> 01:32:55.370 align:start position:0%
I'm a Vanishing breed I'm a primary care
doctor

01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and um you're going you are seeing I
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of you are having
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
difficulty finding a primary care doctor
 
01:33:04.450 --> 01:33:04.460 align:start position:0%
where you live that is not an accident
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
and I'll discuss this briefly
 
01:33:09.169 --> 01:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
um so you're hearing from your
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
constituents about this and what I'd
 
01:33:14.110 --> 01:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
like to do is introduce HP 319
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
which is sponsored by representative
 
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
Schmidt and proposes creating a
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
legislative committee
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
based in the legislature appointed by
 
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
folks in the legislature but including
 
01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
multiple stakeholders
 
01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:30.860 align:start position:0%
including folks from communities
 
01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
this committee would study the merits of
 
01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
an all-payer Global budget system
 
01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
that can bring down the Absurd costs of
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
Health Care that your constituents are
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with both in their property
 
01:33:49.330 --> 01:33:49.340 align:start position:0%
taxes in their
 
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
employee sponsored insurers
 
01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
and business owners who are trying to
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
keep up with this
 
01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make a couple of key
 
01:34:01.370 --> 01:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
points I'm going to just read a little
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
bit from here as well but
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
we have seen just now from uh the
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
discussion simply about drugs
 
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has no overall
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
strategy to manage the explosion of
 
01:34:18.770 --> 01:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
health care costs that we have all seen
 
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
in the past 40 years there is no overall
 
01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
strategy you have one group that may be
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
looking at prescription drugs another
 
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
looking at insurance issues but unlike
 
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
all other New England states by the way
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Advantage has in this
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
case resulted in a major disadvantage
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
according to the New Hampshire Insurance
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
Department's published information in
 
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.229 align:start position:0%
Department's published information in
2021

01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the highest premiums
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
and deductibles
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
that our Citizens need to pay for
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
employee sponsored Insurance in all of
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
New England
 
01:34:53.159 --> 01:34:54.350 align:start position:0%
New England
and

01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:57.250 --> 01:34:57.260 align:start position:0%
we are 49th
 
01:35:00.649 --> 01:35:00.659 align:start position:0%
in having the highest cost with the 49th
 
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
highest cost of deductibles of that
 
01:35:06.169 --> 01:35:06.179 align:start position:0%
insurance this is a real issue
 
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
it's not imaginary
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
a couple things about all pair is
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
probably something that is new to you
 
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
that word
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh it is not going to be new to you in
 
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
the next six months next 12 months
 
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
you're going to be reading a lot more
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
about this because centers for Medicare
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
Services has looked at the Maryland
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
model and said hey this does work we
 
01:35:29.209 --> 01:35:29.219 align:start position:0%
have saved in Maryland
 
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
billions that's B of dollars since the
 
01:35:36.649 --> 01:35:36.659 align:start position:0%
institution of this program and they are
 
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
now going to be introducing this across
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
the country
 
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking that this legislature in
 
01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:45.290 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking that this legislature in
fact

01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
start to look at taking responsibility
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
for overall strategy for health care
 
01:35:53.050 --> 01:35:53.060 align:start position:0%
costs and accessibility and quality
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
and this is one such model that would be
 
01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
important to look at
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I heard something about
 
01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.970 align:start position:0%
um you know I heard something about
transparency

01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
of costs
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
and I hear from my patients as you hear
 
01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
from your constituents
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
you have no idea what the cost of that
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
procedure will be until you get the bill
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the mail
 
01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
um yes you could see prices listed uh
 
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire there's been
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
efforts there's been legislation passed
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
nationally as well as locally but those
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
costs remain opaque
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
not by accident it's how the system is
 
01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:38.270 align:start position:0%
not by accident it's how the system is
structured

01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
structured
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
um we heard a little bit about
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
proprietary costs for drugs well the
 
01:36:45.970 --> 01:36:45.980 align:start position:0%
amounts paid by your insurance company
 
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
for a particular service if it's a
 
01:36:51.850 --> 01:36:51.860 align:start position:0%
private a for-profit insurance company
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
what they pay for your appendectomy for
 
01:36:57.290 --> 01:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
your colonoscopy for your whatever it
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
might be Hospital related or even
 
01:37:02.689 --> 01:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
outpatient is not transparent if you
 
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
have an MRI your doctor ordered
 
01:37:07.610 --> 01:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
yeah you could look up what MRIs cost
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
but you're not clinicians you're not
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to know if you need intravenous
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
contrast with that MRI if it needs to be
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
of this organ or that the costs remain
 
01:37:20.090 --> 01:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
opaque because that is how the status
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
quo has designed it that's not by
 
01:37:24.649 --> 01:37:24.659 align:start position:0%
accident so as you know Private health
 
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
care insurers
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
during the 1990s uh basically led the
 
01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:31.990 align:start position:0%
during the 1990s uh basically led the
show

01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
show
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
so American health insurance plans ahip
 
01:37:39.649 --> 01:37:39.659 align:start position:0%
represents a managed care hmos that
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
basically Ruled The Nest or the roost uh
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
in the 1990s and dictated to hospitals
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
this is how much we're going to pay you
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
for that procedure
 
01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
hospitals got smart
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
they decided to structure systems
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not by accident that Leahy
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
Clinic expanded as it did that Brigham
 
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
and women actually MGH Brigham used to
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
be called Partners expanded as it did uh
 
01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
that Dartmouth Health has expanded as it
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
has it wishes to have more clout in
 
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
those negotiations and in fact now
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
the Health Care Systems local Health
 
01:38:21.169 --> 01:38:21.179 align:start position:0%
Care Systems like Leahy DH and these
 
01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
large systems they actually have more
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
command of those negotiations that
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
happen behind closed doors
 
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
with the insurance companies that is
 
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
proprietary information although there's
 
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
may there's now a law and effort there
 
01:38:38.930 --> 01:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
is recent legislation trying to pry open
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
that that information it is hard to do
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
so what you have is the health insurers
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
now dictating to the insurance companies
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
this is what you need to pay us because
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
we have this many communities that you
 
01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
have insurance in
 
01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:57.950 align:start position:0%
have insurance in
okay

01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.930 --> 01:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
the health insurance companies say no
 
01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.629 align:start position:0%
the health insurance companies say no
problem

01:39:01.629 --> 01:39:01.639 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
the ACA mandated that Health insurers
 
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
pay 80 percent of their revenue
 
01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
to Health Care
 
01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
the other 20 percent you could use for
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
administration for overhead for profit
 
01:39:16.679 --> 01:39:17.570 align:start position:0%
administration for overhead for profit
Etc

01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
so it the health insurance like a
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
utility that's unregulated says okay
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're charging us more no problem we
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
will raise our premiums and our
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
deductibles it's no issue and it's not
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
by accident that these prices have been
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
accelerating in the recent past because
 
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
of the change in the health structure in
 
01:39:37.729 --> 01:39:37.739 align:start position:0%
the health industry
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
um this is uh well recognized by the way
 
01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:42.620 align:start position:0%
there was a study that came out Tuesday
 
01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
in general American Medical Association
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
looking at Health Systems
 
01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
they raised the the prices through
 
01:39:52.850 --> 01:39:52.860 align:start position:0%
communities uh and they do not pay that
 
01:39:54.770 --> 01:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
they do not provide better quality and
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's been my experience as a
 
01:39:59.450 --> 01:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
practicing physician in in New Hampshire
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
so they have little incentive to keep
 
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
down costs they make the same profit
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
regardless the problem is
 
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
what we pay for as Citizens this is
 
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
public knowledge it's on the New
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Insurance department's website
 
01:40:17.410 --> 01:40:17.420 align:start position:0%
published 2020 and 2021
 
01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
both in the large and small group
 
01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
Insurance markets this is private
 
01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:23.870 align:start position:0%
Insurance markets this is private
insurance

01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:40:26.930 --> 01:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh we averaged 19 higher than the
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
average deductible in the United States
 
01:40:33.169 --> 01:40:33.179 align:start position:0%
and as you know we also pay higher
 
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
premiums for both the large and small
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
group markets than the U.S average or
 
01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
any other New England State that's not
 
01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
by accident because no one's watching
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
the store uh I don't have to tell you
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
between 2000 2019 when average inflation
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
given recent variables has been about 53
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
percent the price of your employee
 
01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
premium contributions went up 243
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
percent that is not looking at their
 
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
deductibles that's premiums so there's a
 
01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:01.850 align:start position:0%
deductibles that's premiums so there's a
problem

01:41:01.850 --> 01:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
if you have to have a colonoscopy and
 
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
you have to pay five thousand dollars
 
01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
out of your pocket to get that done
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
because you have a cheaper plan but
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's your deductible are you going to
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
get your colonoscopy heck no you're
 
01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
going to get your surgery for your colon
 
01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:16.729 align:start position:0%
going to get your surgery for your colon
cancer

01:41:16.729 --> 01:41:16.739 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
um is what's going to happen
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and this is do I see this in my
 
01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:22.550 align:start position:0%
um and this is do I see this in my
practice

01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
yes this is a reality
 
01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:27.890 align:start position:0%
yes this is a reality
um

01:41:27.890 --> 01:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:29.570 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
um another reality I mentioned I'm a
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
Vanishing breed of primary care Ducks I
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of you have had
 
01:41:37.609 --> 01:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
difficulty finding primary care where
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:41:41.689 --> 01:41:41.699 align:start position:0%
that is not by accident either and
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:48.380 align:start position:0%
the private intermediary Health insurers
 
01:41:52.129 --> 01:41:52.139 align:start position:0%
selectively pay for more services than
 
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
others The Benchmark is Medicare as you
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
know Medicaid pays the least nobody
 
01:41:59.149 --> 01:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
wants to take it Medicare intermediate
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
employee sponsored insurers they pay the
 
01:42:04.129 --> 01:42:04.139 align:start position:0%
most but not for everything
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
if you ever wondered why you see the ads
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
for knee Replacements in the local
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
hospital or the bypass surgery it's
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
because the hospitals make 330 percent
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
over Medicare for some selected
 
01:42:19.729 --> 01:42:19.739 align:start position:0%
procedures and surgeries
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%
they get the best revenue for doing
 
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
things to people
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
Primary Care
 
01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
um family practitioners Primary Care
 
01:42:32.410 --> 01:42:32.420 align:start position:0%
internists pediatricians
 
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists what do we do we spend
 
01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
time in front of our patient talking
 
01:42:37.729 --> 01:42:37.739 align:start position:0%
about okay tell me about how you're
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
managing your diabetes how are you doing
 
01:42:42.169 --> 01:42:42.179 align:start position:0%
with your depression is that impacting
 
01:42:43.609 --> 01:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
how you're taking care of your diabetes
 
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
of course it is that's lengthy that
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
takes time guess what that's reimbursed
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
10 percent more than Medicare
 
01:42:52.490 --> 01:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:42:55.930 --> 01:42:55.940 align:start position:0%
Primary Care is the only
 
01:42:58.490 --> 01:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
sub-specialty recognized that you have
 
01:43:00.649 --> 01:43:00.659 align:start position:0%
more docs who are primary care docs you
 
01:43:03.169 --> 01:43:03.179 align:start position:0%
have improved longevity you have less
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
illness why we do lead screening for
 
01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
kids we take care of your cholesterol
 
01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
before you need that bypass surgery we
 
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
manage your diabetes it's low cost
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
low-tech timely and not reimbursed
 
01:43:20.450 --> 01:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
hospitals look at primary Hospital
 
01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:22.010 align:start position:0%
hospitals look at primary Hospital
systems

01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
whose intent is the right place don't
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
get me wrong when they have to manage
 
01:43:28.189 --> 01:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
their finances
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
they look at Primary Care as a lost
 
01:43:30.119 --> 01:43:31.490 align:start position:0%
they look at Primary Care as a lost
leader

01:43:31.490 --> 01:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
leader
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we'll keep we'll we'll maintain
 
01:43:36.970 --> 01:43:36.980 align:start position:0%
it but we certainly won't incentivize it
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
this has been the experience across the
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
United States this is not new this has
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
Maryland and other states that have all
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
pair systems figured this out some years
 
01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:52.729 align:start position:0%
pair systems figured this out some years
ago

01:43:52.729 --> 01:43:52.739 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
if we can disincentivize hospitals from
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
building more more real estate
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
if we can level the payments for a
 
01:44:04.199 --> 01:44:05.930 align:start position:0%
if we can level the payments for a
service

01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
between all insurers and by all insurers
 
01:44:10.570 --> 01:44:10.580 align:start position:0%
that means Medicare
 
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
Medicaid which hospitals hate taking
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
because they lose money on it and
 
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
employee sponsored insurers then there's
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
one price for a service it's easy to
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
translate what your MRI is going to cost
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
because there's one price for it it's
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
not across the state it's per hospital
 
01:44:26.890 --> 01:44:26.900 align:start position:0%
by the way that's important
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals by the way that are teaching
 
01:44:32.209 --> 01:44:32.219 align:start position:0%
hospitals that have a neonatal ICU these
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
have big ticket items
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
they have different needs than Cottage
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hospital or Androscoggin hospital or
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
whatnot they have different costs so the
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
all-payer system
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
creates a transparent state agency
 
01:44:52.250 --> 01:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
basically would incorporate all the
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
other agencies that you that comes
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
before this committee on HHS on a
 
01:44:59.330 --> 01:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
regular basis gathers the data and says
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay let's sit down between Southern New
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Center St Joe's and
 
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
Humana or Cigna or whatever and let's
 
01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
negotiate what you think is going to be
 
01:45:11.689 --> 01:45:11.699 align:start position:0%
the right price they set a price that's
 
01:45:14.689 --> 01:45:14.699 align:start position:0%
uniform for all those in those employees
 
01:45:16.729 --> 01:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
sponsored for profit insurers Medicare
 
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
guess what it is allowed many hospitals
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
in Maryland to avoid the revenue issues
 
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
they've been dealt dealing with during
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
the pandemic they have a global budget
 
01:45:30.169 --> 01:45:30.179 align:start position:0%
they can predict what they're going to
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
get paid the next year and it's up to
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
the hospital there's a lot of autonomy
 
01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
hospitals can decide do I want to pay
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
staff more do I want to invest more in
 
01:45:43.609 --> 01:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
prevention of of opioid addictions do I
 
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
want to spend more on I don't know an
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
orthopedic procedures if it's if that's
 
01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
their their want but they they have the
 
01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
autonomy to do that
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
but they have the data by which to do it
 
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
because that's also an important
 
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
component of this it's compiled it's
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
it's put together
 
01:46:01.129 --> 01:46:01.139 align:start position:0%
um and it works
 
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
you have before you some of those
 
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
specific statistics
 
01:46:09.410 --> 01:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
but the reason CMS is now going to
 
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
incentivize the development of all pair
 
01:46:13.609 --> 01:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
systems is it is
 
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
um really had a major impact on saving
 
01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
money for the residents of Maryland
 
01:46:23.209 --> 01:46:23.219 align:start position:0%
one other issue it's also helped keep
 
01:46:25.729 --> 01:46:25.739 align:start position:0%
rural hospitals out of the red I don't
 
01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
need to tell you many rural hospitals
 
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
have closed across the country
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
the reason for that as you may know is
 
01:46:35.290 --> 01:46:35.300 align:start position:0%
they don't have pair mix
 
01:46:37.609 --> 01:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
rural hospitals such as where I'm
 
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
practicing currently are working often
 
01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
where manufacturing has left these are
 
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
rust belts
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have a lot of folks on
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
employee sponsored insurances who pay
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
better they have a lot of folks on
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid even if they're working a lot
 
01:46:51.890 --> 01:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
of working folks on Medicaid and many
 
01:46:53.209 --> 01:46:53.219 align:start position:0%
older folks who remained in the
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
communities on Medicare they don't they
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
have Medicare and Medicaid and that's
 
01:46:58.490 --> 01:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
where they get their revenue they don't
 
01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
have the pay or mix
 
01:47:02.689 --> 01:47:02.699 align:start position:0%
so when you set a price on a global
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
budget for such a hospital it can
 
01:47:06.169 --> 01:47:06.179 align:start position:0%
predict what's going to happen the next
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
year it's not going to be vulnerable to
 
01:47:10.129 --> 01:47:10.139 align:start position:0%
pandemics or to these payer mixes
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be incentivized
 
01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
actually towards quality and serving the
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
community which is some of the
 
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
benchmarks that the total cost of Care
 
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
Program in Maryland has done
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
I think the other important issue this
 
01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
is a Commerce Committee you you deal
 
01:47:28.370 --> 01:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
with folks in many different
 
01:47:31.629 --> 01:47:31.639 align:start position:0%
jobs and works and walks of life
 
01:47:34.129 --> 01:47:34.139 align:start position:0%
hospitals actually have come to embrace
 
01:47:35.689 --> 01:47:35.699 align:start position:0%
this remember there's academic
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
institutions in Maryland namely John
 
01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:38.530 align:start position:0%
institutions in Maryland namely John
Hopkins

01:47:38.530 --> 01:47:38.540 align:start position:0%
Hopkins
 
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
the academic institutions which are
 
01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
teaching hospitals as well as the
 
01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
independent other hospitals private
 
01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals or Community Hospitals have
 
01:47:49.850 --> 01:47:49.860 align:start position:0%
embraced this because it makes it more
 
01:47:51.890 --> 01:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
predictable and they're having
 
01:47:53.689 --> 01:47:53.699 align:start position:0%
assistance in looking at these Global
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
budgets for with the data that's
 
01:47:55.199 --> 01:47:57.229 align:start position:0%
budgets for with the data that's
gathered

01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
gathered
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think that it's something to get
 
01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be important in years
 
01:48:06.530 --> 01:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
to come because of the the crisis that
 
01:48:09.050 --> 01:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
we're actually seeing right now
 
01:48:11.450 --> 01:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
um I don't the statistics are in um the
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
stuff that I've I've provided you
 
01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
um and um uh I think that I will share
 
01:48:20.689 --> 01:48:20.699 align:start position:0%
that no health system is perfect I want
 
01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:24.179 align:start position:0%
to underline that that is clearly true
 
01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
but in my career I have never seen the
 
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
health system in as much trouble as it
 
01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
is right now
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
the status quo is not working it's not
 
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
serving as an advantage to New Hampshire
 
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
um and I think that creating this
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
legislative committee well I'm sorry the
 
01:48:42.890 --> 01:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
study committee from the legislature uh
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
to at least look at all pair and other
 
01:48:47.770 --> 01:48:47.780 align:start position:0%
options is a first necessary step
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
to have some overall strategy for New
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and create a sustainable
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
affordable Equitable and trusted Health
 
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:57.950 align:start position:0%
affordable Equitable and trusted Health
System

01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
System
 
01:49:01.129 --> 01:49:01.139 align:start position:0%
so at that I'll conclude and welcome to
 
01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
take questions great uh representative
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
Herbert has a question for you
 
01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
um your last statement
 
01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:08.990 align:start position:0%
um your last statement
um

01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:11.209 --> 01:49:11.219 align:start position:0%
we I don't know if you were here when we
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
and the previous bill was discussed
 
01:49:17.290 --> 01:49:17.300 align:start position:0%
would it be your advice
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:21.050 align:start position:0%
that we
um

01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:23.689 --> 01:49:23.699 align:start position:0%
keep that uh original
 
01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
I am speaking on a related but different
 
01:49:36.410 --> 01:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
topic yeah no no it's not no I I would
 
01:49:38.450 --> 01:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
say I would agree with Dr Sherman
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
because with what's obvious to all of
 
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
you yeah that there are no restraints
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
on the cost of pharmaceuticals because
 
01:49:48.770 --> 01:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
there are no restraints on the cost of
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals pbm's uh the pharmacy
 
01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
benefit managers
 
01:50:00.050 --> 01:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
are opaque they do not serve insurance
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
subscribers they serve the for-profit
 
01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
insurers that's their design and
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
non-profit too anyhow but that's not far
 
01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:09.669 align:start position:0%
non-profit too anyhow but that's not far
sorry

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:50:12.530 --> 01:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
that was a terrible question okay uh
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
yeah you don't ask you have an opinion
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
about a different bill yeah what do you
 
01:50:18.169 --> 01:50:18.179 align:start position:0%
have a specific question about this bill
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
in front of you do you have a specific
 
01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
question about this bill
 
01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
um no I was going to do would you
 
01:50:27.649 --> 01:50:27.659 align:start position:0%
believe that uh chairman hunt and I have
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
sat through uh an explanation literally
 
01:50:34.729 --> 01:50:34.739 align:start position:0%
a couple hours of about pbms and and
 
01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
trying to explain to us
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
that uh what it how it works and I'll be
 
01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
honest with you
 
01:50:46.250 --> 01:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
I left that and I had no idea other than
 
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that it was very this is a
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
would you believe question would you
 
01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
believe would you believe that the cost
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
of your hospital care and your community
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
care is equally opaque
 
01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:58.609 align:start position:0%
care is equally opaque
yes

01:50:58.609 --> 01:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:51:00.649 --> 01:51:00.659 align:start position:0%
okay unless you go on the insurance
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
Department's price doesn't help you
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm getting at why doesn't
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
it because every procedure has details
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
that are clinical
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
is this an emergency procedure because
 
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
you're Landing in that emergency room
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
because you're in the midst of having it
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
no I'm not worried about emergency no no
 
01:51:18.770 --> 01:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
but but those are part of the costs no
 
01:51:20.810 --> 01:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
no but I'm saying that MRI but you'll
 
01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
get a bill for four weeks later you
 
01:51:25.149 --> 01:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
can't shop around you're you're
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
obviously you can't shop around an
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
emergency yes right but those costs are
 
01:51:31.490 --> 01:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
extraordinary and that's where people go
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
bankrupt okay not when they have
 
01:51:37.250 --> 01:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
three months to research where in New
 
01:51:40.850 --> 01:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can I get my knee replaced I'm
 
01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:43.139 align:start position:0%
passing a kidney stone today
 
01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
I need to go to the local hospital
 
01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
because I'm in excruciating pain I can't
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
figure out or I'm having an MI a
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
myocardial heart attack I can't tell the
 
01:51:56.090 --> 01:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
ambulance driver take me to Androscoggin
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
instead of you know uh Littleton because
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's cheaper they will take you to the
 
01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
closest hospital when it comes to real
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
costs for New Hampshire citizens
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
that emergency
 
01:52:11.330 --> 01:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
is real that's what kill that's what
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
makes New Hampshire citizens go bankrupt
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
if you have the time to to shop around
 
01:52:18.169 --> 01:52:18.179 align:start position:0%
it's still going to be opaque you're not
 
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
I just talked with somebody the other
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
day got an immunization for something I
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
didn't realize it was going to cost 600
 
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
I checked beforehand it and and that's
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
someone who's Savvy and not in an
 
01:52:31.070 --> 01:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
emergency so to answer your question is
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
it equally opaque yes does ahip want
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
Americans to know that no
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
um they were in it legitimately to make
 
01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
a profit that's their mission statement
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
serving New Hampshire citizens you have
 
01:52:49.370 --> 01:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
to come you have to balance that so it
 
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
is equally opaque and I make that
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
statement comfortably represent feellet
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
it would be fair to say that on the
 
01:52:58.970 --> 01:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
insurance department's website all
 
01:53:01.129 --> 01:53:01.139 align:start position:0%
procedures are listed however my ability
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
to choose the provider for those
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
procedures is limited by whether it is
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
um so what's the distinction between
 
01:53:17.209 --> 01:53:17.219 align:start position:0%
listed prices for emergencies versus so
 
01:53:18.649 --> 01:53:18.659 align:start position:0%
I haven't been on the website recently
 
01:53:20.209 --> 01:53:20.219 align:start position:0%
last time I did I was pulling my hair
 
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
maybe it's better now
 
01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:24.050 align:start position:0%
maybe it's better now
um

01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
the problem is insurance companies so a
 
01:53:29.689 --> 01:53:29.699 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of issues with managed care
 
01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
and employee sponsored insurance by the
 
01:53:34.729 --> 01:53:34.739 align:start position:0%
way Medicare and Medicaid it's pretty
 
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
transparent because we pay for it
 
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
directly from the taxpayer when it comes
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
to our premiums and deductibles that's
 
01:53:43.729 --> 01:53:43.739 align:start position:0%
not transparent because it's paid
 
01:53:43.739 --> 01:53:45.530 align:start position:0%
not transparent because it's paid
indirectly

01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
indirectly
 
01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:46.189 align:start position:0%
indirectly
um

01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:48.590 --> 01:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
so there is a difference between an
 
01:53:50.090 --> 01:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
emergency procedure and a non-emergency
 
01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
procedure but we are clinically there's
 
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
so many details that go into the
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
performance of a particular procedure
 
01:53:59.870 --> 01:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
that you really have to be a physician
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
to know does this kidney stone that I'm
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
passing need intravenous contrast can I
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
do it without contrast can I do this CT
 
01:54:09.770 --> 01:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
scan versus an ultrasound Etc plus your
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
insurance changes if you're if your
 
01:54:13.970 --> 01:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
company changes insurances and the
 
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
insurance changes their policies and
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursements depending on their
 
01:54:19.370 --> 01:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
negotiations I don't know if that
 
01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
answered your question uh that was great
 
01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:27.129 --> 01:54:27.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh I'm afraid I have a would you believe
 
01:54:33.470 --> 01:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
um in reference to non-emergency
 
01:54:39.169 --> 01:54:39.179 align:start position:0%
procedures would you believe that every
 
01:54:41.570 --> 01:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
single time I have a routine procedure
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking really routine think
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
blood tests I ask what my out-of-pocket
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
cost is going to be because if I could I
 
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
would rather pay up front than get a
 
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
bill in the mail
 
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
and every single time I am told we have
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
no idea
 
01:55:02.810 --> 01:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
absolutely I hear this daily your
 
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
constituents are seeing this daily
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's not a what would you believe it's
 
01:55:10.609 --> 01:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
yeah I know
 
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much for your
 
01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
testimony we appreciate it welcome thank
 
01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:14.930 align:start position:0%
testimony we appreciate it welcome thank
you

01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:55:28.750 --> 01:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.850 --> 01:55:31.860 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Dr James Fisher I'm
 
01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
retired also a primary care physician I
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
I don't have a ton of things to add to
 
01:55:40.729 --> 01:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
what Dr dolcart said because he's been
 
01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
leading this uh but I do want to clarify
 
01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that might be helpful
 
01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
and I also want to answer any questions
 
01:55:48.050 --> 01:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
that you might have and I think it's
 
01:55:51.169 --> 01:55:51.179 align:start position:0%
probably more important right now
 
01:55:54.290 --> 01:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
um I think uh one of the things that
 
01:55:56.450 --> 01:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
came up in the questions were about
 
01:55:59.810 --> 01:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
emergency care versus routine costs and
 
01:56:01.850 --> 01:56:01.860 align:start position:0%
and that's important I'm glad that you
 
01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
were able to make a distinction
 
01:56:06.109 --> 01:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
but one of the problems that that Dr
 
01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
dolkart mentioned is that it's more
 
01:56:10.370 --> 01:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
difficult to find primary care
 
01:56:14.450 --> 01:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
physicians I was one of them and on a
 
01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
personal story I've been working for at
 
01:56:20.689 --> 01:56:20.699 align:start position:0%
um Portsmouth Hospital for about
 
01:56:24.290 --> 01:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
close to 20 years and Portsmouth
 
01:56:26.209 --> 01:56:26.219 align:start position:0%
Hospital back in
 
01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
2014 2015 went through a primary care
 
01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
Purge there was a report that we heard
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
one of our
 
01:56:38.689 --> 01:56:38.699 align:start position:0%
meetings that the administration gave
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned specifically that Primary Care
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
was a loss leader and that the hospital
 
01:56:47.090 --> 01:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
Administration thought that they had way
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
too many Primary Care Providers
 
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
and they said we need to cut about 20 or
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
30 positions which they did and I was
 
01:56:58.729 --> 01:56:58.739 align:start position:0%
one of those those positions I ended up
 
01:57:01.129 --> 01:57:01.139 align:start position:0%
at the VA hospital and was happy to get
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
into the VA system that's another story
 
01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
um but as a result of having fewer
 
01:57:09.770 --> 01:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
Primary Care providers and it's not just
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
Physicians there's nurse practitioners
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
there's Pas and so on but what happens
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
is fewer people able to get in in a
 
01:57:19.310 --> 01:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
timely manner and when you have fewer
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians it means that
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to be taking care of
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
themselves as much you're going to get
 
01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
more emergencies you're going to get
 
01:57:30.530 --> 01:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
more problems coming out and people are
 
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
going to need emergency care emergency
 
01:57:35.810 --> 01:57:35.820 align:start position:0%
procedures and so by definition you're
 
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
going to drive up the cost of medical
 
01:57:40.669 --> 01:57:40.679 align:start position:0%
care so yeah it's nice to know in
 
01:57:43.370 --> 01:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
advance but even trying to know in
 
01:57:45.050 --> 01:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
advance is difficult because sometimes
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
things happen even during regular
 
01:57:51.770 --> 01:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
procedures so it's difficult as as Dr
 
01:57:54.169 --> 01:57:54.179 align:start position:0%
dulcart mentioned you know complications
 
01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
occur even when it's a routine procedure
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
and so you don't always know and so
 
01:58:00.109 --> 01:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
you're you're getting these extra bills
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
and it's driving up the cost
 
01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
the other thing I like about uh this
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
particular house bill it doesn't force
 
01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
you to do anything okay it asks you it
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
it beckons you to look at other ways of
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
reducing medical costs and and I I know
 
01:58:21.169 --> 01:58:21.179 align:start position:0%
some of you campaigned on issues on
 
01:58:24.649 --> 01:58:24.659 align:start position:0%
inflation well there's no bigger spot to
 
01:58:26.689 --> 01:58:26.699 align:start position:0%
look at inflation than in medical care
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
costs it's been the the biggest driver
 
01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
that's been going on for well over a
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
decade several decades so that if you're
 
01:58:37.689 --> 01:58:37.699 align:start position:0%
really truly interested in in in
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
containing inflation this is a great
 
01:58:43.129 --> 01:58:43.139 align:start position:0%
place to start this is something you can
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
go back to your constituents and say
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
look we've looked at this okay and we
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
want to do something about it it doesn't
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
commit you to actually doing something
 
01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:52.729 align:start position:0%
commit you to actually doing something
yet

01:58:52.729 --> 01:58:52.739 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
but it at least gives you a perspective
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
that you can take back to people and let
 
01:58:58.729 --> 01:58:58.739 align:start position:0%
you let them know about
 
01:59:01.609 --> 01:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
others of you were concerned about local
 
01:59:04.689 --> 01:59:04.699 align:start position:0%
care and and local community control
 
01:59:08.209 --> 01:59:08.219 align:start position:0%
well that's what this also does okay it
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
allows individual hospitals to decide
 
01:59:14.990 --> 01:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
what their Global budget is going to be
 
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
from from one year to the next or for as
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
long as you decide that that time
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
commitment that time frame is going to
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
be and so it takes it takes a lot of the
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
the costs or the determination of costs
 
01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
away from large insurance companies
 
01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure aren't going to like this
 
01:59:36.649 --> 01:59:36.659 align:start position:0%
very much and it puts it more in the
 
01:59:38.930 --> 01:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
control of local hospitals
 
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
where we live uh so those are just a
 
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
couple of points that I heard from the
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
questioning I I'm not as well let me
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
just answer any questions you might have
 
01:59:52.850 --> 01:59:52.860 align:start position:0%
based on either what I've said or any
 
01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
backup on on your questions on Dr
 
01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:58.370 align:start position:0%
backup on on your questions on Dr
dolkert

01:59:58.370 --> 01:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
02:00:03.649 --> 02:00:03.659 align:start position:0%
oh come on I'm not that clear you've got
 
02:00:05.810 --> 02:00:05.820 align:start position:0%
to have some questions well sure I'll
 
02:00:07.070 --> 02:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
ask a question how is this going to
 
02:00:09.410 --> 02:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
control prices when when the house you
 
02:00:10.669 --> 02:00:10.679 align:start position:0%
say the hospitals will determine the
 
02:00:13.250 --> 02:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
price or is it or is it good I see here
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
is that there's going to be a select
 
02:00:19.370 --> 02:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
board who's going to decide how much
 
02:00:22.089 --> 02:00:22.099 align:start position:0%
that hospital can get no
 
02:00:24.589 --> 02:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the hospital is
 
02:00:26.209 --> 02:00:26.219 align:start position:0%
going to con is going to have their
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
Global budget and and it's it the budget
 
02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
is based on patient care not based on
 
02:00:33.709 --> 02:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
real estate you know we're going to buy
 
02:00:36.050 --> 02:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
up uh you know the land next door so we
 
02:00:38.450 --> 02:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
can expand whatever this is based on
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
care at all as itself so that the
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals determined from one from one
 
02:00:46.370 --> 02:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
year to the next the way that kind of
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
saves money is that we'll take the
 
02:00:50.330 --> 02:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
pandemic for example okay we've just
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
gone through this and we're still going
 
02:00:54.290 --> 02:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
through it it's not over I mean it's now
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
an endemic it's going to be with us for
 
02:00:59.450 --> 02:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
a long long time but the hospitals that
 
02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
that will fare the best are the ones
 
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
that know what their what they need for
 
02:01:06.350 --> 02:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
personnel to manage from one year to the
 
02:01:08.990 --> 02:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
next so part of their Global budgeting
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
will be based on you know how many
 
02:01:13.490 --> 02:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
employees they need so they can
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
determine that if they have to if they
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
what's happening now in New Hampshire is
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
people are burnt out they're quitting
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're retiring early and so
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
what a hospitals doing well they have to
 
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
hire a lot of temps well that's twice as
 
02:01:31.129 --> 02:01:31.139 align:start position:0%
expensive as just simply having somebody
 
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
on staff or having extra people on staff
 
02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
that drives up their costs so by being
 
02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:39.300 align:start position:0%
able to budget a year in advance what
 
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
they're going to need to take care of
 
02:01:42.109 --> 02:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
the people in their Community that's
 
02:01:44.689 --> 02:01:44.699 align:start position:0%
going to save money over time
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you very
 
02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:48.770 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you very
much

02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
Donald College
 
02:02:03.950 --> 02:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and
 
02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
honorable members
 
02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to keep my my comments short
 
02:02:13.729 --> 02:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
um I am a I've been for 42 years a
 
02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
family physician in New Hampshire
 
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
my career began in the North Country I
 
02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
was practicing in Monroe New Hampshire
 
02:02:22.010 --> 02:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
and admitting to The Cottage Hospital in
 
02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:23.209 align:start position:0%
and admitting to The Cottage Hospital in
Woodsville

02:02:23.209 --> 02:02:23.219 align:start position:0%
Woodsville
 
02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
now these comments relate only to this
 
02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
bill about Hospital financing but I'll
 
02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
refer to my background again later for
 
02:02:32.689 --> 02:02:32.699 align:start position:0%
the next bill
 
02:02:34.729 --> 02:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
as president of the medical staff of
 
02:02:34.739 --> 02:02:35.870 align:start position:0%
as president of the medical staff of
cottage

02:02:35.870 --> 02:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
cottage
 
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
I learned that hospitals which serve
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
low-income communities
 
02:02:42.649 --> 02:02:42.659 align:start position:0%
and cottage serve farmers and loggers
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
and small business people
 
02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
depends on an adequate payer mix
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
High proportions of Medicaid and
 
02:02:55.810 --> 02:02:55.820 align:start position:0%
self-pay can sink a hospital
 
02:02:59.149 --> 02:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
during that period I also worked in the
 
02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
emergency room of the hospital in
 
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
Newport and I saw the Newport Hospital
 
02:03:07.609 --> 02:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
close for exactly that reason
 
02:03:09.530 --> 02:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
an oil-payer system has been
 
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
demonstrated in Maryland to save
 
02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:13.790 align:start position:0%
demonstrated in Maryland to save
hospitals

02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
I believe it deserves a close look to
 
02:03:17.629 --> 02:03:17.639 align:start position:0%
see if could result in the same
 
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
combination of controlling costs and
 
02:03:21.970 --> 02:03:21.980 align:start position:0%
improving quality in New Hampshire
 
02:03:27.169 --> 02:03:27.179 align:start position:0%
primarily by establishing a single price
 
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
for services at that hospital regardless
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to take questions
 
02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:37.209 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to take questions
marvelous

02:03:37.209 --> 02:03:37.219 align:start position:0%
marvelous
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
what is the thinking for for all of you
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
for setting up a committee versus just
 
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
crafting a bill to accomplish what
 
02:03:51.709 --> 02:03:51.719 align:start position:0%
you're looking for
 
02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
um I think the main reason is because
 
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
there are many experts here in New
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who we can't readily have
 
02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
access to particularly the experts from
 
02:04:02.649 --> 02:04:02.659 align:start position:0%
the insurance department
 
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
and I think that that from my
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of the Maryland Bill and
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
also of the even more complex overly
 
02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
complex as far as I'm concerned Vermont
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
all pay our bill which requires huge
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
data collection
 
02:04:22.729 --> 02:04:22.739 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that involving
 
02:04:24.649 --> 02:04:24.659 align:start position:0%
the insurance department will make it
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
possible to craft something that is um
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
efficient and
 
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
um and effective so I think in order to
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
bring in the expertise that we have in
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
this state a committee would be the most
 
02:04:41.169 --> 02:04:41.179 align:start position:0%
efficient way of doing it
 
02:04:43.490 --> 02:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
represent Philip
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is probably
 
02:04:46.609 --> 02:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
going to require a little bit of go back
 
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
and forth to to get to where I'm going
 
02:04:52.070 --> 02:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
to as I understand it any medical
 
02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
procedures require any number of
 
02:04:56.930 --> 02:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
variables to get to the final cost as as
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
our previous speaker talked to about
 
02:05:01.010 --> 02:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
that for example Imaging may require
 
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
contrast or no contrast is that correct
 
02:05:09.410 --> 02:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
yes and that will change the cost of the
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
procedure for example if there is
 
02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
contrast or not is that right yes
 
02:05:17.570 --> 02:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
and would that be if we if there was an
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
all-payer system would the need for
 
02:05:22.129 --> 02:05:22.139 align:start position:0%
those types of variables still remain in
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare correct
 
02:05:25.729 --> 02:05:25.739 align:start position:0%
um not quite
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
um because the way that that hospital
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
billing works right now is led by
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
Medicare is by bundling
 
02:05:35.450 --> 02:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
all of the the care for any given
 
02:05:38.589 --> 02:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
condition into a single bill
 
02:05:38.599 --> 02:05:40.510 align:start position:0%
condition into a single bill
this

02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
all-payer system only deals with
 
02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
inpatient services does not deal with
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
outpatient services so that when
 
02:05:49.810 --> 02:05:49.820 align:start position:0%
somebody is admitted to the hospital
 
02:05:52.669 --> 02:05:52.679 align:start position:0%
with let us say a heart attack or a
 
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
kidney stone
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
um the total charge would be for the
 
02:06:00.070 --> 02:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
total care of that condition
 
02:06:02.770 --> 02:06:02.780 align:start position:0%
and so therefore
 
02:06:06.050 --> 02:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
shares risk
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
because it provides a single price
 
02:06:15.169 --> 02:06:15.179 align:start position:0%
for all payers to care for anybody who
 
02:06:17.089 --> 02:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
comes to that hospital with that heart
 
02:06:19.330 --> 02:06:19.340 align:start position:0%
attack or with that kidney stone
 
02:06:22.930 --> 02:06:22.940 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not they
 
02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
use contrast for that MRI or not
 
02:06:29.689 --> 02:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
okay I think I understand so for the
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
question you may inquire rather than
 
02:06:33.770 --> 02:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
under the current system where for
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
example it may be and rather than be
 
02:06:40.370 --> 02:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
particular surgery a is the billing it
 
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
would be heart attack care would be the
 
02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
billing it and you'll have to forgive
 
02:06:46.850 --> 02:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
the facts that I'm not a physician would
 
02:06:48.890 --> 02:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
that be is that correct the way that I'm
 
02:06:50.570 --> 02:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
understanding it short answer is yes
 
02:06:52.729 --> 02:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
although they are often very closely
 
02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
linked if you come in with appendicitis
 
02:06:56.810 --> 02:06:56.820 align:start position:0%
the definitive treatment for
 
02:07:00.169 --> 02:07:00.179 align:start position:0%
appendicitis is an appendectomy
 
02:07:03.070 --> 02:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
um the big difference is that right now
 
02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
Medicare is the only payer that does
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
this bundling
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the other ones all of the other
 
02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
payers the commercial insurers
 
02:07:16.490 --> 02:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
um pay for individual charges for each
 
02:07:20.570 --> 02:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
of the the contrast each of the aspirin
 
02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:21.950 align:start position:0%
of the the contrast each of the aspirin
tablets

02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
tablets
 
02:07:25.550 --> 02:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
um as well as the or charges so by
 
02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
simplifying it to be bundled around that
 
02:07:31.370 --> 02:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
unit of care
 
02:07:33.950 --> 02:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
and by charging the same amount to all
 
02:07:36.589 --> 02:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
payers it will both control costs and
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
allow for planning so one final for a
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up so for me as a
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
as a non-medically trained person if my
 
02:07:45.410 --> 02:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
stomach hurts and I want to quickly
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
figure out how much this is going to
 
02:07:48.589 --> 02:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
cost me I would have to right now
 
02:07:51.410 --> 02:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
without all pay or go onto a website
 
02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
look through these procedures have no
 
02:07:54.530 --> 02:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
idea how much this is going to cost
 
02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:57.179 align:start position:0%
whereas with an all-payer I could
 
02:08:00.410 --> 02:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
quickly look up app uh appendectomy or
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
appendicitis and quick get a quick
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
glance at this is ballpark yeah short
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
answer is is if you're really really
 
02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:08.750 align:start position:0%
answer is is if you're really really
lucky

02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
lucky
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
um because if you have abdominal pain
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
sadly you do not know if it's
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
appendicitis diverticulitis or you know
 
02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
or pseudocyesis
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
um you know and they might want to try
 
02:08:23.570 --> 02:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
to cure it with antibiotics before they
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
put you under the knife so so at any
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
rate so
 
02:08:31.729 --> 02:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
I want you to know I really like you to
 
02:08:33.290 --> 02:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
see check the New Hampshire Insurance
 
02:08:35.570 --> 02:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
Department's page because we are
 
02:08:38.689 --> 02:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
bundling we actually we were able to
 
02:08:40.129 --> 02:08:40.139 align:start position:0%
match up
 
02:08:42.649 --> 02:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
because an office you have uh
 
02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist you'll have the visit
 
02:08:46.370 --> 02:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
care and the physician and you have a
 
02:08:49.129 --> 02:08:49.139 align:start position:0%
hospital truck we were actually able to
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
bundle all those together so when it
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
comes time for one of those procedures
 
02:08:55.790 --> 02:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
that you're interested that you elected
 
02:08:58.250 --> 02:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
obviously non-emergency if it's elected
 
02:09:01.490 --> 02:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
procedure you can actually see what the
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
cost is for that hospital yes and thank
 
02:09:07.790 --> 02:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I I think this might be
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
a true beer conversation about how that
 
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
um that data that that is provided on
 
02:09:16.250 --> 02:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
that website that I've looked at not not
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps as extensively as you would like
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
me to does not
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
um provide the same price for all pairs
 
02:09:28.070 --> 02:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
because each payer negotiates separately
 
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
so again we're what we're talking here
 
02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
is is there's your apples and oranges
 
02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
one is what is the cost that the
 
02:09:37.490 --> 02:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
hospital is going to charge okay so even
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
your insurance company is a little fuzzy
 
02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
on that because they don't know which
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
primary care which physician which
 
02:09:43.129 --> 02:09:43.139 align:start position:0%
surgeon is going to show up that day
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
okay so but you can go on and see what
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
the cost is the hospital Cost Plus the
 
02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
doctor fees plus all those added costs
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
then your question is well how much is
 
02:09:55.010 --> 02:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
my insurance company going to do my
 
02:09:56.689 --> 02:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
deductible you have to call your
 
02:09:58.970 --> 02:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
insurance company that at that point and
 
02:10:01.609 --> 02:10:01.619 align:start position:0%
say with this procedure
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
what gets paid yep I I I I I I do
 
02:10:06.770 --> 02:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and I think that this is
 
02:10:08.330 --> 02:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
almost as
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
um as difficult for hospitals to plan
 
02:10:16.129 --> 02:10:16.139 align:start position:0%
their budget as it is for individuals
 
02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
such as an early representative
 
02:10:21.109 --> 02:10:21.119 align:start position:0%
um because it all again depends on pay
 
02:10:24.609 --> 02:10:24.619 align:start position:0%
or mix and and figuring out how much
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
each of those if there are 100
 
02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
appendectomies they may get paid
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
um 30 different amounts so I'd be
 
02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
interesting you bring that up because I
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
heard you have a statements made before
 
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
and this I'm going to use this as an
 
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
education for my committee because I
 
02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
have a lot of new members so right now
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
we run on fee for service all right so
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
that means absolutely the hospital does
 
02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
not know how many people they're going
 
02:10:49.250 --> 02:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
to get the old model of Managed Care was
 
02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
capitation in which they got reversed
 
02:10:54.770 --> 02:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
regardless of how many procedures they
 
02:10:56.930 --> 02:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
did okay people didn't like habitations
 
02:10:58.010 --> 02:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
because it seemed like they were getting
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
paid for procedures they didn't do and
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's why we got rid of capitation so
 
02:11:04.609 --> 02:11:04.619 align:start position:0%
the idea that you're going to use this
 
02:11:07.550 --> 02:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
bill is to help a hospital budget I
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
would then assume is that you plan to
 
02:11:11.689 --> 02:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
get a rid of fee for service and that
 
02:11:13.970 --> 02:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
you're going to allow that hospital to
 
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
charge some space amount and to the
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
insurance company based on a perp or
 
02:11:22.129 --> 02:11:22.139 align:start position:0%
decapitation rate because you want them
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
to pay for not doctors and nurses who
 
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
might not actually do anything but
 
02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
because that is a fixed price that they
 
02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
negotiated ahead of time
 
02:11:35.209 --> 02:11:35.219 align:start position:0%
um and with apologies um chairman you
 
02:11:36.609 --> 02:11:36.619 align:start position:0%
know we
 
02:11:40.189 --> 02:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
again that this might take a while but
 
02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:43.139 align:start position:0%
um I'm not in favor of capitation I
 
02:11:45.709 --> 02:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
think that that at least not at this
 
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
level I think that what is often now
 
02:11:50.930 --> 02:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
called value-based care ends up being so
 
02:11:50.940 --> 02:11:52.089 align:start position:0%
called value-based care ends up being so
gamable

02:11:52.089 --> 02:11:52.099 align:start position:0%
gamable
 
02:11:56.209 --> 02:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
by by insurance companies that what what
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm proposing is not capitation but
 
02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:02.209 align:start position:0%
what I'm proposing is not capitation but
rather

02:12:02.209 --> 02:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
rather
 
02:12:05.089 --> 02:12:05.099 align:start position:0%
um by bundling
 
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
around a unit of care I'm sorry a unit
 
02:12:11.330 --> 02:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
of concern which is diagnosis and care
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
but then charging the same amount
 
02:12:18.290 --> 02:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
to all insurers
 
02:12:20.030 --> 02:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
for that condition
 
02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
is not capitation
 
02:12:25.609 --> 02:12:25.619 align:start position:0%
what this is doing is creating a even
 
02:12:28.729 --> 02:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
playing field for the hospitals and for
 
02:12:30.410 --> 02:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
the insurers
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
because they're not what what is what
 
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
kills us all is the cost shifting by
 
02:12:36.540 --> 02:12:37.609 align:start position:0%
kills us all is the cost shifting by
having

02:12:37.609 --> 02:12:37.619 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:12:40.490 --> 02:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
um all payer there's no cost shifting
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
everybody pays the same whether it's
 
02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:49.370 --> 02:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much for your
 
02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:50.390 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much for your
testimony

02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
oh my God okay who's got their hand up
 
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
yes representative McVay
 
02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm reading from page two of this
 
02:13:01.729 --> 02:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
bill number one it says establishing an
 
02:13:03.530 --> 02:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
agency or Board of New Hampshire that
 
02:13:06.530 --> 02:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
has the authority to set negotiated uh
 
02:13:08.569 --> 02:13:08.579 align:start position:0%
for in paper in Hospital patient
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
services Etc where do you get the
 
02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
leverage to do that what does this group
 
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
have any leverage I don't understand
 
02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:16.430 align:start position:0%
have any leverage I don't understand
that

02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that I can easily answer
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
that because I don't understand well how
 
02:13:24.050 --> 02:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
how boards I was interested to hear
 
02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
about the the the pharmacy board and how
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
complex it was to establish it but
 
02:13:33.530 --> 02:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
um the I think that that leverage comes
 
02:13:36.050 --> 02:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
through the insurance department and so
 
02:13:37.729 --> 02:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
I think the answer to the question is is
 
02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
that the study committee is then going
 
02:13:42.169 --> 02:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
to be given uh they're going to create a
 
02:13:44.089 --> 02:13:44.099 align:start position:0%
statute that's going to create this
 
02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
board and this board would have the
 
02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
authority to tell the hospital how much
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to get the let me clarify
 
02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
I think that that
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and I'd have to take a very close
 
02:13:58.490 --> 02:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
look at the individual words the amount
 
02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
that the hospital gets for that unit of
 
02:14:03.410 --> 02:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
care is negotiated it is not the board
 
02:14:05.569 --> 02:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
telling it yeah word negotiators there
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
that is correct yeah and and this is
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
very important because
 
02:14:11.450 --> 02:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
um this will determine how much premiums
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
um and and so it the board is not
 
02:14:17.209 --> 02:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
setting prices it's guiding the
 
02:14:17.219 --> 02:14:18.709 align:start position:0%
setting prices it's guiding the
negotiation

02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
02:14:21.010 --> 02:14:21.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
02:14:25.129 --> 02:14:25.139 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yes representative post so what
 
02:14:32.569 --> 02:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
it would be like redistribution because
 
02:14:40.129 --> 02:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid and Medicare that those
 
02:14:42.169 --> 02:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
dollars if it's negotiated now the
 
02:14:45.050 --> 02:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
state's going to have to pick that up
 
02:14:49.030 --> 02:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
um no ma'am the um the each hospital
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
will negotiate with the board with
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
representation of the insurance
 
02:14:56.770 --> 02:14:56.780 align:start position:0%
companies as to how many let's say
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
appendectomies they they take care of in
 
02:15:01.250 --> 02:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
any given year
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
um and instead of
 
02:15:05.410 --> 02:15:05.420 align:start position:0%
um of having
 
02:15:05.420 --> 02:15:06.950 align:start position:0%
um of having
the

02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:08.330 align:start position:0%
the
um

02:15:08.330 --> 02:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:10.189 --> 02:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
each Ensure
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
negotiate a separate price
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
all payers will have the same price for
 
02:15:18.589 --> 02:15:18.599 align:start position:0%
that appendectomy so a person who has
 
02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
none who did not have any insurance at
 
02:15:24.649 --> 02:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
all will still have to pay a bill
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
um although many hospitals some
 
02:15:28.910 --> 02:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals pursue those bills some write
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
it off
 
02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
people who have Medicaid Medicaid will
 
02:15:34.850 --> 02:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
pay that that price people who have
 
02:15:38.569 --> 02:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
Medicare or Cigna or something else they
 
02:15:41.569 --> 02:15:41.579 align:start position:0%
will all pay that price so the the no
 
02:15:43.550 --> 02:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
bill will be coming back to the state
 
02:15:45.169 --> 02:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
except to the extent to which the
 
02:15:48.290 --> 02:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
state's contribution to Medicaid
 
02:15:50.990 --> 02:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
um is is contributing
 
02:15:53.810 --> 02:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
okay now we're all set thank you
 
02:15:56.089 --> 02:15:56.099 align:start position:0%
uh chair we're calling Heather Stockwell
 
02:16:08.890 --> 02:16:08.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:17.629 --> 02:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
it's good
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
I was going to say good morning but I
 
02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
guess it's officially afternoon now
 
02:16:22.079 --> 02:16:22.910 align:start position:0%
guess it's officially afternoon now
um

02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:25.370 --> 02:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
my name is Heather Stockwell I've lived
 
02:16:27.770 --> 02:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for over 50 years and
 
02:16:29.810 --> 02:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
in fact my father served in the state
 
02:16:31.970 --> 02:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
legislature and was a friend and
 
02:16:34.009 --> 02:16:34.019 align:start position:0%
colleague of your chairperson here John
 
02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
Hunt for many of the years that they
 
02:16:38.330 --> 02:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
serve together
 
02:16:40.730 --> 02:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
so thank you for this process and for a
 
02:16:43.250 --> 02:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
chance to speak to you today I'm in
 
02:16:46.490 --> 02:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
support of this bill as a patient
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
um I think that not only does this bill
 
02:16:51.290 --> 02:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
bring more fairness and transparency and
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
oversight to hospitals and insurance
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
companies but it's also here for the
 
02:16:59.629 --> 02:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
patient and as the consumer affairs
 
02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
committee I'm hoping that you all have
 
02:17:07.310 --> 02:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
my Consumer Protections in mind
 
02:17:08.990 --> 02:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
and right now
 
02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
as somebody mentioned before I feel like
 
02:17:14.509 --> 02:17:14.519 align:start position:0%
we don't have a great Advantage we call
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
this state that we have this Granite
 
02:17:20.209 --> 02:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
State Advantage yet not only are in our
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
insurance rates higher than any other
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
state we have very high rates of
 
02:17:27.410 --> 02:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
deductibles as was said before we also
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
which nobody has mentioned has the
 
02:17:31.129 --> 02:17:31.139 align:start position:0%
highest rate or not the highest rate we
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
have one of the higher rates of denials
 
02:17:37.310 --> 02:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:40.129 --> 02:17:40.139 align:start position:0%
this would not in my view I don't think
 
02:17:41.690 --> 02:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
that that kind of thing would happen as
 
02:17:43.250 --> 02:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
much because people would know ahead of
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
time and in fact two years ago my
 
02:17:48.290 --> 02:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
husband had a surgery where he was
 
02:17:49.730 --> 02:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
denied care
 
02:17:51.889 --> 02:17:51.899 align:start position:0%
he already had the surgery so it was
 
02:17:54.530 --> 02:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
afterwards and we were being left with a
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
six thousand dollar bill
 
02:17:59.450 --> 02:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
we had already done our budgeting we
 
02:18:02.030 --> 02:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
thought we'd paid everything
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
the hospital told us that it was our
 
02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:07.429 align:start position:0%
the hospital told us that it was our
responsibility

02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:18:09.889 --> 02:18:09.899 align:start position:0%
now I don't know what you all pay for
 
02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums I'm told I have one
 
02:18:16.669 --> 02:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
of the best policies I can get
 
02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
they still denied that care that year
 
02:18:22.969 --> 02:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
I paid 24
 
02:18:22.979 --> 02:18:23.830 align:start position:0%
I paid 24
000

02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:18:28.610 --> 02:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
in premiums alone we almost lost our
 
02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:30.650 align:start position:0%
in premiums alone we almost lost our
house

02:18:30.650 --> 02:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:18:33.169 --> 02:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire need need
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
y'all to stand up for them we are being
 
02:18:39.469 --> 02:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
nickeled and dimed to death we have so
 
02:18:42.049 --> 02:18:42.059 align:start position:0%
many co-payments and sometimes I don't
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
even know when I'm going to get another
 
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill from another company that's like a
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
like a radiology or an Imaging uh test
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
that I've had to have I get another bill
 
02:18:55.310 --> 02:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
for that or I get blood work and and
 
02:18:59.629 --> 02:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
that lab has their own separate billing
 
02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
it's exhausting as a consumer every day
 
02:19:06.650 --> 02:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
we are we are trying to negotiate
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%
through scam callers emails texting now
 
02:19:15.290 --> 02:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
it's gotten to a point where I cannot
 
02:19:20.089 --> 02:19:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.110 --> 02:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
that's a sad State of Affairs
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
and and I I really um I I don't know all
 
02:19:29.690 --> 02:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
of the ins and outs of uh the details of
 
02:19:31.969 --> 02:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
how the hospital would budget budget but
 
02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
as was said it is a negotiated thing and
 
02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
as someone who has you know not had
 
02:19:40.669 --> 02:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
insurance for over a decade and suffered
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
that way have switched had to you know
 
02:19:46.969 --> 02:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
switched jobs and policies and doctors
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
because this insurance wouldn't pay that
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.610 --> 02:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
a lot of the work is getting put on the
 
02:19:58.010 --> 02:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
patient or the consumer and it's it's
 
02:20:01.610 --> 02:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
gotten to a point where that's part of
 
02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
getting care we I really feel like I
 
02:20:08.570 --> 02:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
don't have any more time and energy I
 
02:20:11.330 --> 02:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
need to concentrate on my care and every
 
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
patient should be concentrating on their
 
02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:14.510 align:start position:0%
patient should be concentrating on their
care

02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:20:17.090 --> 02:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
not worrying about what they're going to
 
02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
be left with as a bill I've also been on
 
02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I've worked with a lot of do a
 
02:20:23.389 --> 02:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
lot of work around Medicaid and I talk
 
02:20:25.310 --> 02:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
to a lot of people about their health
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
care in the state I I work as a
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
healthcare organizer
 
02:20:31.310 --> 02:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
and do a lot of community outreach and
 
02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
even people on Medicaid and Medicare are
 
02:20:36.290 --> 02:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
being denied care it is um or they don't
 
02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
understand oh it's so complex I helped
 
02:20:41.150 --> 02:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
my husband sign up for Medicare this
 
02:20:41.160 --> 02:20:42.170 align:start position:0%
my husband sign up for Medicare this
year

02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:20:45.530 --> 02:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
it was so complex we needed help
 
02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
we couldn't understand all of all of the
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
ins and outs of the policies they're
 
02:20:52.490 --> 02:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
going to pay this much of this if this
 
02:20:54.530 --> 02:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
happens or this much of this if this
 
02:20:56.809 --> 02:20:56.819 align:start position:0%
happens when I was pregnant 20 years ago
 
02:20:59.570 --> 02:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
I called our local hospital to find out
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
how much it would cost for me to deliver
 
02:21:03.469 --> 02:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
my baby
 
02:21:05.929 --> 02:21:05.939 align:start position:0%
and I got that same answer
 
02:21:08.809 --> 02:21:08.819 align:start position:0%
well we can't tell you that
 
02:21:10.849 --> 02:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
because there's too many variables and I
 
02:21:13.610 --> 02:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
said well let's let's just think about
 
02:21:16.969 --> 02:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
no variables my birth is normal fine I'm
 
02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
out of here in 24 hours how much can you
 
02:21:23.330 --> 02:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:25.490 --> 02:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
they couldn't tell me they gave me a
 
02:21:28.429 --> 02:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
range of 20 to 30 000 and when I did the
 
02:21:30.530 --> 02:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
math of the percentage that I would have
 
02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
02:21:34.849 --> 02:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
I realized I was not going to be able to
 
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
afford to deliver my baby in a hospital
 
02:21:41.809 --> 02:21:41.819 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong here I did find
 
02:21:43.550 --> 02:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
Alternative Care
 
02:21:45.290 --> 02:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
at a birthing room
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
near the hospital if I needed it
 
02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
I figured that women have been doing
 
02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
this for thousands of years
 
02:21:54.889 --> 02:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
without hospitals that I should probably
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
be able to do this
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
even that provider told told me that I
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
said how much is it going to cost and
 
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
they said well let's see how much we can
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
bill your insurance company for so what
 
02:22:07.910 --> 02:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is right now we're
 
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
encouraging fraud in the insurance
 
02:22:12.349 --> 02:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
industry and the hospital industry and
 
02:22:14.330 --> 02:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
hospitals are not they say they're
 
02:22:14.340 --> 02:22:15.650 align:start position:0%
hospitals are not they say they're
non-profit

02:22:15.650 --> 02:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
I've heard that in this room today
 
02:22:20.929 --> 02:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
but hospitals aren't really giving back
 
02:22:22.130 --> 02:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
to their Community they're buying
 
02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
to their Community they're buying
property

02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
they're not helping patients that can't
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
afford their care and in fact I've been
 
02:22:30.050 --> 02:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
in that situation where I did not have
 
02:22:31.969 --> 02:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
insurance at the time that I fell down
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
the stairs and broke my leg and I was
 
02:22:36.530 --> 02:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
stuck with an astronomical bill at that
 
02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:38.510 align:start position:0%
stuck with an astronomical bill at that
point

02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
I applied
 
02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:41.929 align:start position:0%
I applied
persistence

02:22:41.929 --> 02:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
persistence
 
02:22:43.969 --> 02:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
they accepted
 
02:22:45.950 --> 02:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
and then I was asked a year later if I
 
02:22:49.309 --> 02:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:51.050 --> 02:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
it was an amount of money that I hadn't
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
seen in
 
02:22:55.250 --> 02:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh at least one you know no year in my
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
life had I ever made that much money it
 
02:22:58.429 --> 02:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
was you know over a hundred thousand
 
02:23:00.650 --> 02:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
dollars uh that's not even including the
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
actual operation that was my Hospital
 
02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:04.210 align:start position:0%
actual operation that was my Hospital
stay

02:23:04.210 --> 02:23:04.220 align:start position:0%
stay
 
02:23:06.590 --> 02:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
this isn't
 
02:23:09.410 --> 02:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
this isn't affordable to average
 
02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire or anywhere
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
really quite frankly we really need to
 
02:23:17.150 --> 02:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
to oops sorry reign in those costs I
 
02:23:19.610 --> 02:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
talk with my hands we really and I I
 
02:23:23.090 --> 02:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
believe that this would help us do this
 
02:23:26.690 --> 02:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh I think
 
02:23:28.130 --> 02:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
we're all questioned out thank you very
 
02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:29.050 align:start position:0%
we're all questioned out thank you very
much

02:23:29.050 --> 02:23:29.060 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:23:31.250 --> 02:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:33.530 --> 02:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh so Ken can you really do it in one
 
02:23:33.540 --> 02:23:36.349 align:start position:0%
uh so Ken can you really do it in one
minute

02:23:36.349 --> 02:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay so what I recommend is is that you
 
02:23:40.429 --> 02:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
mail us you know you can get on the web
 
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
page you can see get all and and and
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
send it to us but that would be the best
 
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
way to do it okay
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:55.610 --> 02:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:59.150 --> 02:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
353 we're about to take up
 
02:24:03.410 --> 02:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:34.080 --> 02:25:04.270 align:start position:0%
 
surprise

02:25:04.270 --> 02:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:07.250 --> 02:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
stay apart
 
02:25:08.990 --> 02:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:39.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
yeah

02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:39.120 --> 02:26:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
Church

02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
everybody who's here to testify to know
 
02:26:26.929 --> 02:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
that all bills in this committee
 
02:26:30.349 --> 02:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
go to a subcommittee and we have a
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
smaller group who are focused on just
 
02:26:35.389 --> 02:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
insurance and so they would be the ones
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
who who would be uh there but we don't
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
take testimony when we do a subcommittee
 
02:26:42.650 --> 02:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
we we just thrash out a bill and you
 
02:26:44.990 --> 02:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
know and and get to go get to an answer
 
02:26:47.450 --> 02:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
so otherwise
 
02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:48.889 align:start position:0%
so otherwise
um

02:26:48.889 --> 02:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
and we love written testimonies yes
 
02:26:53.330 --> 02:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
sending stuff written testimony is great
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's very appreciative okay Peter
 
02:26:59.450 --> 02:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
three minutes you're on
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
again for the record Peter Schmidt
 
02:27:05.150 --> 02:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative Dover award one
 
02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
um and I am pleased to come before you
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 353 FN
 
02:27:12.490 --> 02:27:12.500 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:27:15.790 --> 02:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
I have been the beneficiary of
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
single-payer for about the last 20 years
 
02:27:21.130 --> 02:27:21.140 align:start position:0%
I'm just about to turn 85
 
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
and before I had the coverage under
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
Medicare I was always in kind of a
 
02:27:29.690 --> 02:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
catch's catch can situation sometimes I
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
had coverage sometimes I didn't
 
02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
so not only have I had excellent care
 
02:27:37.130 --> 02:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
for 20 years but I've also had
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
affordability that's the advantage of
 
02:27:43.010 --> 02:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
single-payer is that there's a system
 
02:27:46.190 --> 02:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
that pays a cost on the basis of a
 
02:27:49.070 --> 02:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable Insurance one of the aspects
 
02:27:52.849 --> 02:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
of the Affordable Care Act is that it in
 
02:27:55.790 --> 02:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
El Candor it ain't that affordable but
 
02:27:58.969 --> 02:27:58.979 align:start position:0%
it's better than nothing and way more
 
02:28:01.309 --> 02:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
affordable than nothing which is what
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
many people had before so the concept of
 
02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
my bill is single-payer for the State of
 
02:28:11.330 --> 02:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but to make the
 
02:28:13.309 --> 02:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
affordability much greater because we
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
only have a million 300 000 people
 
02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:17.150 align:start position:0%
only have a million 300 000 people
roughly

02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
02:28:21.050 --> 02:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh is that the the basic costs are
 
02:28:23.090 --> 02:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
spread among a very much smaller
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
population so the other aspect of my
 
02:28:28.610 --> 02:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
bill is it creates a compact of the
 
02:28:30.170 --> 02:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
Willing obviously we would have to
 
02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
negotiate with Maine
 
02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island any other New England
 
02:28:38.330 --> 02:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
states that want to participate to have
 
02:28:41.270 --> 02:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
a compact that would have 10 to 12
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
million people if all the states were
 
02:28:46.490 --> 02:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
involved that would spread the cost out
 
02:28:49.849 --> 02:28:49.859 align:start position:0%
over a much larger number of people we'd
 
02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
obviously have to have a Single Payer
 
02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
plan in place to be able to negotiate
 
02:28:58.849 --> 02:28:58.859 align:start position:0%
with these other states but it it would
 
02:29:00.830 --> 02:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
have that advantage of much greater
 
02:29:02.929 --> 02:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
affordability than we would have
 
02:29:05.410 --> 02:29:05.420 align:start position:0%
otherwise so
 
02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
the The Single Payer com compact uh
 
02:29:12.770 --> 02:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
sorry the single-payer part of the bill
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
is very thoroughly explained it's a
 
02:29:19.130 --> 02:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
standard single-payer player pay payer
 
02:29:22.429 --> 02:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
plan that I believe is based on the
 
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
Illinois state plan so anyway I will I
 
02:29:28.670 --> 02:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
will end my testimony at this point
 
02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
answer any simple questions you may have
 
02:29:36.290 --> 02:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
and then a lead on to my colleagues who
 
02:29:39.410 --> 02:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
will give their testimony
 
02:29:41.690 --> 02:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
okay representative spear
 
02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
and you're going to be right to the
 
02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
good

02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
and you have to speak right into the
 
02:29:51.530 --> 02:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
microphone all of you are not following
 
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
that rule speak right into the
 
02:29:56.690 --> 02:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
microphone then it works it ain't Magic
 
02:29:56.700 --> 02:29:58.910 align:start position:0%
microphone then it works it ain't Magic
okay

02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:30:01.130 --> 02:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:30:03.410 --> 02:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
you talk in the in the in the bill you
 
02:30:06.170 --> 02:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
it's mentioned that um
 
02:30:09.130 --> 02:30:09.140 align:start position:0%
you'll negotiate with Medicare
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
as one of the people to help fund this
 
02:30:14.270 --> 02:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
this trust I went online and looked and
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare said that they don't do that so
 
02:30:19.309 --> 02:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
how would you how do you feel this is
 
02:30:21.469 --> 02:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
going to get funded I think that's a
 
02:30:23.389 --> 02:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
better question from my colleagues who
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
are more knowledgeable in these
 
02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:27.349 align:start position:0%
are more knowledgeable in these
specifics

02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
specifics
 
02:30:29.929 --> 02:30:29.939 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much
 
02:30:47.330 --> 02:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:50.570 --> 02:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay yep go ahead
 
02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
so uh good morning Mr chair and members
 
02:30:55.490 --> 02:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Thomas Lane
 
02:30:57.710 --> 02:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm from Hanover
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
I helped write this bill
 
02:31:01.250 --> 02:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
um because I'm sick and tired of seeing
 
02:31:02.929 --> 02:31:02.939 align:start position:0%
our state suffer needlessly from
 
02:31:04.429 --> 02:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
preventable causes
 
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
as a son and Grandson of three different
 
02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
small business owners and also a student
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
of Economics this bill excites me
 
02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
because it's a new idea to solve one of
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
the biggest problems facing our state
 
02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
our nation and the economy
 
02:31:21.170 --> 02:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
that problem is our health care System
 
02:31:23.450 --> 02:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
as it stands now we pay ridiculous
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
prices and we get ripped off I don't
 
02:31:27.530 --> 02:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
know how many of you have been watching
 
02:31:29.330 --> 02:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
Washington lately
 
02:31:30.710 --> 02:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
um but last I checked they haven't been
 
02:31:33.710 --> 02:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
very helpful on Healthcare recently
 
02:31:35.870 --> 02:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
um for the taxes we pay to them uh we
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
get headlines about fraud waste and
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
abuse in programs like Medicare
 
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
Advantage and the ACO reach program
 
02:31:44.090 --> 02:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
which was just started last year
 
02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
it's time to take agency back into our
 
02:31:48.770 --> 02:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
own pragmatic honest and down-to-earth
 
02:31:51.770 --> 02:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
headlines ants
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
um the big picture here is we pay far
 
02:31:55.130 --> 02:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
more for care that leads to solidly
 
02:31:57.770 --> 02:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
mediocre results compared to our Pure
 
02:32:00.230 --> 02:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
Nations it's an embarrassment and it
 
02:32:01.969 --> 02:32:01.979 align:start position:0%
also puts our businesses at a
 
02:32:04.429 --> 02:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
competitive disadvantage how does that
 
02:32:06.889 --> 02:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
work in our peer Nations businesses
 
02:32:08.330 --> 02:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about health care
 
02:32:10.250 --> 02:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
like they do here
 
02:32:12.770 --> 02:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
their health insurance is managed by
 
02:32:13.969 --> 02:32:13.979 align:start position:0%
something similar to what this bill
 
02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
would create
 
02:32:16.849 --> 02:32:16.859 align:start position:0%
they are free to focus on their trade
 
02:32:19.490 --> 02:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
and offering the best product for the
 
02:32:20.929 --> 02:32:20.939 align:start position:0%
best price
 
02:32:22.429 --> 02:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
in the United States by contrast
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
businesses of all shapes and sizes are
 
02:32:27.349 --> 02:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
expected to somehow also be masters of
 
02:32:28.610 --> 02:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
02:32:30.830 --> 02:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
somehow they're supposed to find a plan
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
to offer their employees amongst a
 
02:32:34.849 --> 02:32:34.859 align:start position:0%
myriad of different overpriced options
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
with ever shrinking benefits and
 
02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:38.630 align:start position:0%
with ever shrinking benefits and
networks

02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
networks
 
02:32:40.670 --> 02:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's a massive chore in financial burden
 
02:32:42.770 --> 02:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
that makes it harder for them to do
 
02:32:44.990 --> 02:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
whatever business it is they should be
 
02:32:46.130 --> 02:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
doing best
 
02:32:47.870 --> 02:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's especially honorous for small
 
02:32:50.929 --> 02:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
businesses like my dads and grandfathers
 
02:32:52.809 --> 02:32:52.819 align:start position:0%
often they just can't afford to navigate
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
the health insurance Maze and struggle
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
to hire workers as a result
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about Labor
 
02:33:01.730 --> 02:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
shortages lately this is part of the
 
02:33:03.889 --> 02:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
reason why in a world of insane
 
02:33:05.330 --> 02:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
Healthcare prices
 
02:33:06.950 --> 02:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
workers don't want to work for firms
 
02:33:08.510 --> 02:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
that can't afford to offer them health
 
02:33:11.210 --> 02:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
insurance after all why would they
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
this bill solves that takes health
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
insurance off the table so our
 
02:33:17.450 --> 02:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
businesses can focus on what they do
 
02:33:19.849 --> 02:33:19.859 align:start position:0%
Best by ensuring that all residents have
 
02:33:22.130 --> 02:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
access to robust health insurance at a
 
02:33:23.809 --> 02:33:23.819 align:start position:0%
price they can afford based on ability
 
02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
02:33:26.650 --> 02:33:26.660 align:start position:0%
we gain a Workforce that is happier
 
02:33:29.210 --> 02:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
healthier and more productive
 
02:33:31.250 --> 02:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
this is an investment in our state's
 
02:33:33.050 --> 02:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
long-term future and will encourage
 
02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
economic growth make our state a more
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
attractive place for folks to move to
 
02:33:39.950 --> 02:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
live in and start businesses in
 
02:33:41.389 --> 02:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
strengthen our families and communities
 
02:33:43.910 --> 02:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
and do all of that in the most cost
 
02:33:46.370 --> 02:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
effective manner
 
02:33:49.309 --> 02:33:49.319 align:start position:0%
as I conclude I want to remind you of
 
02:33:51.230 --> 02:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
some of the key points of this bill
 
02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
it is specifically designed to only go
 
02:33:56.330 --> 02:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
into effect once the time is right in
 
02:33:58.370 --> 02:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
other words it only starts when we have
 
02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
joined with enough fellow states to make
 
02:34:02.270 --> 02:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
it cost effective
 
02:34:04.490 --> 02:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
furthermore it incorporates existing
 
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
Federal funding streams to minimize the
 
02:34:09.349 --> 02:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
burden on taxpayers Via waiver processes
 
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
that do exist
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
02:34:15.230 --> 02:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
it is designed to be durable and
 
02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:16.550 align:start position:0%
it is designed to be durable and
flexible

02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
flexible
 
02:34:19.010 --> 02:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
at its core is the idea of cutting fraud
 
02:34:21.410 --> 02:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
waste and abuse while strengthening
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
families and communities
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
because systems of this type are so
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
efficient even after we open up access
 
02:34:29.870 --> 02:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
to care who all who need it ordinary
 
02:34:31.550 --> 02:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
families will still see significant
 
02:34:34.790 --> 02:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
savings compared to what they pay now
 
02:34:36.889 --> 02:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
finally is about securing our future
 
02:34:38.330 --> 02:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
prosperity and protecting our
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
independence from those who want to take
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
it away from us thank you for your time
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any and all
 
02:34:45.050 --> 02:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
02:34:47.090 --> 02:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
it's perfect that was perfect right
 
02:34:52.010 --> 02:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:54.770 --> 02:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh and if you're willing to part with
 
02:34:57.050 --> 02:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
that does your presentation the clerk
 
02:34:59.270 --> 02:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
would appreciate that of course
 
02:35:01.969 --> 02:35:01.979 align:start position:0%
I thought he was reading from a speech
 
02:35:04.969 --> 02:35:04.979 align:start position:0%
but this is it no that this is different
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
than that
 
02:35:09.170 --> 02:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
okay and representative Burroughs has a
 
02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:10.370 align:start position:0%
okay and representative Burroughs has a
question

02:35:10.370 --> 02:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:35:12.530 --> 02:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question I'm
 
02:35:14.270 --> 02:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if your group has been in
 
02:35:17.090 --> 02:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
contact with with folks who from other
 
02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
states about doing this and what if so
 
02:35:20.990 --> 02:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
what the reaction was yes we have
 
02:35:22.969 --> 02:35:22.979 align:start position:0%
they're interested
 
02:35:28.190 --> 02:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh follow up okay reading here that
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
um you want to incentivize a medical
 
02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
attention uh earlier rather than later
 
02:35:36.830 --> 02:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering how this may fit in
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
with I think one of the biggest failings
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
that we have at least in in my neck of
 
02:35:42.830 --> 02:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
the woods is that we don't do Wellness
 
02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
care we do sick care but we don't do
 
02:35:48.410 --> 02:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
Wellness care which I think could really
 
02:35:51.530 --> 02:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
um save um consumers a lot of money and
 
02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
and avoid a lot of procedures and
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
heartache down the road so I'm wondering
 
02:35:59.030 --> 02:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
if that fits into this at all
 
02:36:00.530 --> 02:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
so the problem with the way we do things
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
now is because people don't know how
 
02:36:04.670 --> 02:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
much they're going to pay and because
 
02:36:07.250 --> 02:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
they hear stories of such big bills they
 
02:36:08.750 --> 02:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
procrastinate going to the doctor you
 
02:36:09.889 --> 02:36:09.899 align:start position:0%
know we should all see the doctor every
 
02:36:11.929 --> 02:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
year for obvious reasons they don't do
 
02:36:11.939 --> 02:36:12.710 align:start position:0%
year for obvious reasons they don't do
that

02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
they only go to the doctor when it's an
 
02:36:16.849 --> 02:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
emergency and emergencies are really
 
02:36:19.130 --> 02:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
really expensive so if we just get
 
02:36:21.950 --> 02:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
people going to the doctor every year by
 
02:36:23.450 --> 02:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
establishing A system that allows them
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
to do so at no charge up front
 
02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:28.610 align:start position:0%
to do so at no charge up front
um

02:36:28.610 --> 02:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:31.010 --> 02:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
they're gonna see the doctor every year
 
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
and that's going to catch things before
 
02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
they turn into disasters which saves us
 
02:36:38.210 --> 02:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
tons of money it saves lives it's just
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
the smart rational thing to do thanks
 
02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:44.150 align:start position:0%
the smart rational thing to do thanks
representative

02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:36:46.670 --> 02:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
are you viewing this as a single pair
 
02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
format or as a public option format a
 
02:36:52.490 --> 02:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
single pair format
 
02:36:56.690 --> 02:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh okay representative here yes
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
actually ladies first representative
 
02:37:05.290 --> 02:37:05.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
oops okay now it's on thank you uh
 
02:37:13.010 --> 02:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure all of my colleagues uh have
 
02:37:15.530 --> 02:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
I've been receiving many many
 
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
um email messages uh in opposition to
 
02:37:23.450 --> 02:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
this bill and many of the writers of
 
02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
those messages make an argument that
 
02:37:29.809 --> 02:37:29.819 align:start position:0%
this proposal would allow interference
 
02:37:31.330 --> 02:37:31.340 align:start position:0%
by the government
 
02:37:36.650 --> 02:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
between uh the doctor and the patient
 
02:37:36.660 --> 02:37:37.190 align:start position:0%
between uh the doctor and the patient
um

02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:40.429 --> 02:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
in your opinion if if you can tell tell
 
02:37:40.439 --> 02:37:41.690 align:start position:0%
in your opinion if if you can tell tell
us

02:37:41.690 --> 02:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:37:48.170 --> 02:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
um would this system uh allow for
 
02:37:51.610 --> 02:37:51.620 align:start position:0%
um greater or lesser or about the same
 
02:37:54.290 --> 02:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
interference uh between the doctor and
 
02:37:56.809 --> 02:37:56.819 align:start position:0%
the patient as we have now from
 
02:37:59.330 --> 02:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
02:38:00.770 --> 02:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
I think it's amusing that you're you're
 
02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
getting those letters because it's
 
02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
actually quite the opposite
 
02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
um we currently have boatloads of
 
02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:07.610 align:start position:0%
um we currently have boatloads of
interference

02:38:07.610 --> 02:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
interference
 
02:38:09.770 --> 02:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
um in the the relationship between your
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
patient and your doctor that existing
 
02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
comes in the form of insurance companies
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
using they'll require prior
 
02:38:19.969 --> 02:38:19.979 align:start position:0%
authorization prior authorizations and
 
02:38:21.710 --> 02:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
other sorts of tactics like that because
 
02:38:24.050 --> 02:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
they make money off of paying for Less
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
care in their insurance company they pay
 
02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
out less they get to keep more
 
02:38:30.050 --> 02:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
um and so what they do is they look for
 
02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
reasons to say no
 
02:38:33.950 --> 02:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
which is really hard which is really
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous because if you're you know
 
02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
some insurance employees some are
 
02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
sitting in an office and you know on the
 
02:38:40.730 --> 02:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
other side of the country in San
 
02:38:42.410 --> 02:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
Francisco or something
 
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
they don't know what's going on in that
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
doctor-patient relationship
 
02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
um and so what we do here with this
 
02:38:50.389 --> 02:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
system is we say you know we're just
 
02:38:53.150 --> 02:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
gonna open it up if the doctor says that
 
02:38:55.610 --> 02:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
that this is what the patient needs
 
02:38:57.710 --> 02:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
and it's you know a normal procedure
 
02:38:59.630 --> 02:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to trust the doctor
 
02:39:02.270 --> 02:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
and we're going to let that go forward
 
02:39:04.370 --> 02:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
um and by you know investing then in in
 
02:39:06.530 --> 02:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
Primary Care
 
02:39:07.849 --> 02:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
because we're going to reduce the amount
 
02:39:09.170 --> 02:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
of those emergency procedures we can
 
02:39:10.969 --> 02:39:10.979 align:start position:0%
afford to do that
 
02:39:12.290 --> 02:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
um and so we're really doing here is
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
again protecting that
 
02:39:16.250 --> 02:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
um doctor-patient relationship from
 
02:39:20.750 --> 02:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:22.910 --> 02:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative McVay
 
02:39:25.130 --> 02:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
um most of the letters I get are saying
 
02:39:27.650 --> 02:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
this is a giant step towards socialized
 
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
medicine and the letters are almost
 
02:39:33.650 --> 02:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
exactly the same who is behind this
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
who's generating generating this kind of
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
negativity you know I see it a lot
 
02:39:41.210 --> 02:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
people see the s word and they get
 
02:39:41.220 --> 02:39:43.130 align:start position:0%
people see the s word and they get
scared

02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
scared
 
02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:43.809 align:start position:0%
scared
um

02:39:43.809 --> 02:39:43.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
this is not socialized medicine
 
02:39:48.530 --> 02:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
socialized medicine is where
 
02:39:50.929 --> 02:39:50.939 align:start position:0%
um doctors are government employees
 
02:39:53.630 --> 02:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
this does not make any doctor a
 
02:39:55.730 --> 02:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
government employee this is just saying
 
02:39:57.889 --> 02:39:57.899 align:start position:0%
that we will provide Insurance to ensure
 
02:39:59.389 --> 02:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
that everyone can go see the doctor the
 
02:40:00.770 --> 02:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
doctors are all going to be employed by
 
02:40:03.290 --> 02:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
the same hospitals or whatever groups
 
02:40:04.730 --> 02:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
they work for if they're you know on
 
02:40:05.929 --> 02:40:05.939 align:start position:0%
their own doing their own private
 
02:40:08.210 --> 02:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
practice nothing that does not change
 
02:40:12.429 --> 02:40:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:15.950 --> 02:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
my question was obviously this is an
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
organized effort to put this down who's
 
02:40:20.090 --> 02:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
behind that
 
02:40:24.050 --> 02:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
George Santos the Koch brothers
 
02:40:25.969 --> 02:40:25.979 align:start position:0%
he's not smart he's paying for his next
 
02:40:27.410 --> 02:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
campaign with this
 
02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:28.370 align:start position:0%
campaign with this
um

02:40:28.370 --> 02:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
you know again I mean the the the
 
02:40:32.270 --> 02:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
private insurance industry is is not
 
02:40:34.309 --> 02:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
going to like this I imagine that that
 
02:40:37.070 --> 02:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
they have an interest in in trying to
 
02:40:38.990 --> 02:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
shoot me down here um I find that
 
02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:40.610 align:start position:0%
shoot me down here um I find that
unfortunate

02:40:40.610 --> 02:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
unfortunate
 
02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:41.690 align:start position:0%
unfortunate
um but

02:40:41.690 --> 02:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know that that's the way it is
 
02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:46.730 align:start position:0%
you know that that's the way it is
okay

02:40:46.730 --> 02:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:40:51.250 --> 02:40:51.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:40:56.690 --> 02:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
I don't have a I don't have a poker face
 
02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:05.570 --> 02:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
is this about the waivers
 
02:41:08.410 --> 02:41:08.420 align:start position:0%
I asked the question before okay
 
02:41:10.910 --> 02:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
it does not allow anybody to go into
 
02:41:12.349 --> 02:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
their income stream and take it and
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
negotiate it away so and neither and I
 
02:41:17.750 --> 02:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
also looked up and neither does
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
um private insurance companies but for
 
02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:20.929 align:start position:0%
um private insurance companies but for
employers

02:41:20.929 --> 02:41:20.939 align:start position:0%
employers
 
02:41:22.969 --> 02:41:22.979 align:start position:0%
employee provided
 
02:41:25.610 --> 02:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
so if these two income streams are not
 
02:41:26.570 --> 02:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
going to work
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
where are you going to get the income
 
02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:41:31.250 --> 02:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
going back to the all player which is
 
02:41:35.330 --> 02:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
not related to this this is not all pair
 
02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
um Maryland has a waiver from the
 
02:41:42.770 --> 02:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:50.210 --> 02:41:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:52.130 --> 02:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
you're you're not Medicare you're not on
 
02:41:54.469 --> 02:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
taxes too you're right you're not on mic
 
02:41:59.170 --> 02:41:59.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
okay so with with programs like um the
 
02:42:07.370 --> 02:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
ACA with Medicare I believe chip as well
 
02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
um you can get waivers they're called
 
02:42:11.210 --> 02:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
Innovation waivers that allow you to
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
take the money and do something better
 
02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
with it than what the federal government
 
02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
is doing if you can prove that you
 
02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
either improve quality
 
02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
or reduce cost without impacting the
 
02:42:22.370 --> 02:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
other or both you know makes sense so
 
02:42:24.590 --> 02:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
these these waivers do exist and they
 
02:42:26.990 --> 02:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
would allow us to take that money and do
 
02:42:28.610 --> 02:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
something better with it
 
02:42:30.889 --> 02:42:30.899 align:start position:0%
yeah so the insurance companies don't
 
02:42:30.899 --> 02:42:31.610 align:start position:0%
yeah so the insurance companies don't
really

02:42:31.610 --> 02:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:42:33.050 --> 02:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
play a role here because they're
 
02:42:34.910 --> 02:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
basically you're telling them to exit
 
02:42:37.190 --> 02:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
the state correct will you put that so
 
02:42:39.410 --> 02:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
yeah the exiting New Hampshire is not a
 
02:42:41.570 --> 02:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
big deal we're only a million what three
 
02:42:43.309 --> 02:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
people but I would say to you since
 
02:42:45.530 --> 02:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
you're in Hanover uh you should look
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
over what happened in Vermont where they
 
02:42:50.389 --> 02:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
are this closest to ever come to
 
02:42:52.910 --> 02:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
actually Implement a single-payer system
 
02:42:55.070 --> 02:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
and it got all the way to the governor's
 
02:42:58.750 --> 02:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
desk and he vetoed it because he said 11
 
02:43:02.690 --> 02:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
increase in the state income tax was too
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
much this bill is designed with that
 
02:43:06.889 --> 02:43:06.899 align:start position:0%
experience in mind
 
02:43:06.899 --> 02:43:07.610 align:start position:0%
experience in mind
um

02:43:07.610 --> 02:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:08.929 --> 02:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
Vermont was trying to do it alone
 
02:43:11.150 --> 02:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
Vermont is very small
 
02:43:12.650 --> 02:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
because of that they're not able to
 
02:43:14.450 --> 02:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
develop the economies of scale necessary
 
02:43:17.150 --> 02:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
to push prices down far enough
 
02:43:20.510 --> 02:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
to limit the the increase in taxes this
 
02:43:21.889 --> 02:43:21.899 align:start position:0%
bill is designed so that it only goes
 
02:43:23.570 --> 02:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
into effect when we have partnered with
 
02:43:25.790 --> 02:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
sufficient states to give us enough
 
02:43:27.650 --> 02:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
economies of scale
 
02:43:31.130 --> 02:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
to make it so that we save lots of money
 
02:43:34.130 --> 02:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
fair enough I don't think New Hampshire
 
02:43:38.210 --> 02:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
wants to put in an income tax for the
 
02:43:40.130 --> 02:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
sole purpose we would we wouldn't have
 
02:43:42.770 --> 02:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
another in we don't have an income tax I
 
02:43:45.530 --> 02:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
know in Vermont needed 11 increase on
 
02:43:49.090 --> 02:43:49.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
do you think that you think economy's a
 
02:43:53.330 --> 02:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
scale got it okay
 
02:43:56.750 --> 02:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh Ahmad Cuddy
 
02:44:01.610 --> 02:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
Dr Cuddy
 
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:17.950 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:21.410 --> 02:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak Mr
 
02:44:23.929 --> 02:44:23.939 align:start position:0%
chairman and esteemed members of this
 
02:44:23.939 --> 02:44:25.190 align:start position:0%
chairman and esteemed members of this
committee

02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:44:31.030 --> 02:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
I'm a physician retired a cardiologist
 
02:44:36.110 --> 02:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
who practiced for 50 years and retired
 
02:44:37.550 --> 02:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
10 years ago
 
02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:38.750 align:start position:0%
10 years ago
so

02:44:38.750 --> 02:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:43.370 --> 02:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
my claim to your attention is that if I
 
02:44:46.429 --> 02:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
speak to you from what I experienced
 
02:44:51.410 --> 02:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
American medicine from 1962 to say early
 
02:44:54.770 --> 02:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
80s 20 years of my career in the United
 
02:44:54.780 --> 02:44:55.910 align:start position:0%
80s 20 years of my career in the United
States

02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
States
 
02:44:59.410 --> 02:44:59.420 align:start position:0%
you would call me a repo and bingo
 
02:45:04.969 --> 02:45:04.979 align:start position:0%
because that era of American Medicine is
 
02:45:10.010 --> 02:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
gone forever because we as an intern and
 
02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
as a resident and trainee in cardiology
 
02:45:16.750 --> 02:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
and so on in different care settings
 
02:45:20.770 --> 02:45:20.780 align:start position:0%
I practically saw no
 
02:45:25.010 --> 02:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
no uninsured patients or no family
 
02:45:29.349 --> 02:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
members going into medical bankruptcy
 
02:45:33.050 --> 02:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
and having to sell their Farm
 
02:45:35.389 --> 02:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
pay for I'm an Interventional
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
cardiologist who had to have stents put
 
02:45:41.690 --> 02:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
in and the patient would you know tell
 
02:45:44.750 --> 02:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
me I saved their life but next visit
 
02:45:47.469 --> 02:45:47.479 align:start position:0%
when they come to see me they would also
 
02:45:50.750 --> 02:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
be having Tears in their eyes because
 
02:45:53.090 --> 02:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
the hospital asked them to Hawk their
 
02:45:56.210 --> 02:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
family farm and that was my experience
 
02:46:01.309 --> 02:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
both in about the last 20 years in
 
02:46:04.130 --> 02:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
central Nebraska but my primary years
 
02:46:07.070 --> 02:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
were in Philadelphia Pennsylvania
 
02:46:09.290 --> 02:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
for 24 years
 
02:46:15.530 --> 02:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
so therefore and all along starting with
 
02:46:20.410 --> 02:46:20.420 align:start position:0%
when I landed here in July 62
 
02:46:25.389 --> 02:46:25.399 align:start position:0%
Saskatchewan Canada had just begun their
 
02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare program for Canada and you may
 
02:46:32.290 --> 02:46:32.300 align:start position:0%
recall or I will tell you that
 
02:46:36.530 --> 02:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
provincial doctors went on strike
 
02:46:40.490 --> 02:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
against Tommy Douglas who was the chief
 
02:46:42.770 --> 02:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
proponent and the governor of the
 
02:46:47.690 --> 02:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
province but he imported doctors from UK
 
02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
and Australia and also to fill in the
 
02:46:53.270 --> 02:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
Gap and the strike got busted in the
 
02:46:55.429 --> 02:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
doctors by Christmas of the year went
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
back participating in the program
 
02:47:02.210 --> 02:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
and that was the nucleus or you know
 
02:47:05.389 --> 02:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
Forerunner of the national Medicare
 
02:47:09.130 --> 02:47:09.140 align:start position:0%
program in Canada and so ever since then
 
02:47:13.250 --> 02:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh my question to myself has been why is
 
02:47:15.410 --> 02:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
it not possible on this side of the
 
02:47:15.420 --> 02:47:16.309 align:start position:0%
it not possible on this side of the
Border

02:47:16.309 --> 02:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
Border
 
02:47:18.410 --> 02:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
and of course there are many many
 
02:47:21.370 --> 02:47:21.380 align:start position:0%
answers anyway for New Hampshire
 
02:47:26.290 --> 02:47:26.300 align:start position:0%
we now spend uh per capita
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh six to seven thousand dollars
 
02:47:32.270 --> 02:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
per year compared to the national
 
02:47:35.270 --> 02:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
average of 5 000. so we are already
 
02:47:38.630 --> 02:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
paying in spending in excess
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
and an average cost for a average person
 
02:47:47.330 --> 02:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
in America now total cost is around
 
02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
estimated around twenty thousand dollars
 
02:47:53.330 --> 02:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
per year out of pocket through Insurance
 
02:47:57.349 --> 02:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
all sorts of outlay cost
 
02:48:00.650 --> 02:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
so if you take an average American
 
02:48:06.050 --> 02:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
family earning say 55 000 that is way
 
02:48:09.370 --> 02:48:09.380 align:start position:0%
over their annual income and we Define
 
02:48:13.630 --> 02:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
we meaning most Health Care Community
 
02:48:15.849 --> 02:48:15.859 align:start position:0%
policy experts
 
02:48:19.490 --> 02:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
that a person should not have to spend
 
02:48:22.370 --> 02:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
more than 10 percent of their annual
 
02:48:24.710 --> 02:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
income on Health Care
 
02:48:27.770 --> 02:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
so why is that
 
02:48:32.410 --> 02:48:32.420 align:start position:0%
obviously and by my historical
 
02:48:36.830 --> 02:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
background around early 80s
 
02:48:40.130 --> 02:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
this profession rendering care to the
 
02:48:43.730 --> 02:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
sick became corporatized
 
02:48:47.330 --> 02:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
and not any you know can blame one
 
02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
person one factor but it happens early
 
02:48:51.590 --> 02:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
it happened
 
02:48:55.010 --> 02:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
and institutions including organized
 
02:48:57.889 --> 02:48:57.899 align:start position:0%
medicine and insurance companies drug
 
02:49:02.330 --> 02:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
companies every player uh need to ask
 
02:49:05.090 --> 02:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
that question did I help to bring about
 
02:49:07.610 --> 02:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
the mess that we are in now
 
02:49:10.790 --> 02:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
and I believe this planet bill that I'm
 
02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:12.130 align:start position:0%
and I believe this planet bill that I'm
supporting

02:49:12.130 --> 02:49:12.140 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
02:49:17.270 --> 02:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
at in a compact uh setting in a regional
 
02:49:19.090 --> 02:49:19.100 align:start position:0%
New England sense
 
02:49:23.809 --> 02:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
would alleviate would take away New
 
02:49:26.270 --> 02:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has 29
 
02:49:30.290 --> 02:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
000 people with no insurance and if you
 
02:49:31.450 --> 02:49:31.460 align:start position:0%
take in
 
02:49:35.270 --> 02:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
underinsured that's about 70 000.
 
02:49:38.870 --> 02:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
and nationally as you probably I'm all
 
02:49:40.730 --> 02:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
familiar with is
 
02:49:44.530 --> 02:49:44.540 align:start position:0%
under uninsured is 29 million in America
 
02:49:48.830 --> 02:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
the richest country in the world and you
 
02:49:50.889 --> 02:49:50.899 align:start position:0%
know birthplace of modern
 
02:49:53.630 --> 02:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh technological scientific medicine
 
02:49:56.750 --> 02:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's still the Envy of the world the
 
02:50:00.130 --> 02:50:00.140 align:start position:0%
mecca of scientific
 
02:50:02.210 --> 02:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
research medicine
 
02:50:04.070 --> 02:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
and people from where I am from
 
02:50:07.130 --> 02:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
originally India and so on still even
 
02:50:09.950 --> 02:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
this generation of doctors training over
 
02:50:12.590 --> 02:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
there look forward dream of coming to
 
02:50:17.150 --> 02:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
America but do you see the Paradox when
 
02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
they land here and when they are put in
 
02:50:22.010 --> 02:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
say Bronx Hospital or a hospital in
 
02:50:25.450 --> 02:50:25.460 align:start position:0%
Manchester or CMC
 
02:50:30.050 --> 02:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
six to ten percent of our people are New
 
02:50:32.750 --> 02:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people are uninsured they
 
02:50:36.410 --> 02:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
cannot afford this this life-saving high
 
02:50:39.610 --> 02:50:39.620 align:start position:0%
quality very scientifically
 
02:50:42.590 --> 02:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
up there level of care
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
so that's where they we experience that
 
02:50:49.429 --> 02:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
Paradox are we also containing a third
 
02:50:52.190 --> 02:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
world within the first world the Paradox
 
02:50:55.849 --> 02:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
you guys can save it by supporting this
 
02:50:55.859 --> 02:50:57.650 align:start position:0%
you guys can save it by supporting this
bill

02:50:57.650 --> 02:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:50:59.389 --> 02:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you that was a
 
02:51:01.370 --> 02:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
time so I appreciate your testimony any
 
02:51:05.990 --> 02:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:07.969 --> 02:51:07.979 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:22.070 --> 02:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
all right looks like we have four cards
 
02:51:23.990 --> 02:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
left and just to remind everyone we're
 
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
using an hourglass so I might interrupt
 
02:51:29.210 --> 02:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
you uh if we get too far we are into the
 
02:51:31.490 --> 02:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
committee's lunch so and uh and I know
 
02:51:33.110 --> 02:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
some of you have been here some of you
 
02:51:35.210 --> 02:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
have been here for some time uh waiting
 
02:51:40.190 --> 02:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
to testify so uh the next uh the next uh
 
02:51:43.730 --> 02:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
person to testify is James flesher
 
02:51:46.370 --> 02:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
representing himself
 
02:51:50.270 --> 02:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:52.790 --> 02:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a tough name I blame my dad
 
02:51:55.429 --> 02:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
for that uh Dr James Fisher you've seen
 
02:51:57.050 --> 02:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
me before I think
 
02:52:00.590 --> 02:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
um let me go through a couple of things
 
02:52:02.870 --> 02:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a fear about
 
02:52:05.630 --> 02:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
socialized medicine and and a lot of
 
02:52:07.309 --> 02:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
that actually came from the insurance
 
02:52:09.469 --> 02:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
industry one of the ways in which they
 
02:52:11.630 --> 02:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
they can Lobby
 
02:52:14.630 --> 02:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
um they don't just Lobby
 
02:52:18.410 --> 02:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
um politicians they can Lobby groups
 
02:52:24.410 --> 02:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
um and uh such as uh the uh cons uh
 
02:52:27.769 --> 02:52:27.779 align:start position:0%
uh just just went out of my head here
 
02:52:27.779 --> 02:52:28.510 align:start position:0%
uh just just went out of my head here
um

02:52:28.510 --> 02:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:32.450 --> 02:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
so and so the in lobbying groups they
 
02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
they planted the idea of well we'll do
 
02:52:36.469 --> 02:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
socialized medicine because that seems
 
02:52:38.690 --> 02:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
like some sort of government control
 
02:52:41.330 --> 02:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
um well you know the government has
 
02:52:43.490 --> 02:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
things like Medicare which pretty much
 
02:52:46.010 --> 02:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
keeps its hands off of what happens
 
02:52:48.590 --> 02:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
personally with us with with
 
02:52:50.809 --> 02:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
um our I'm still trying to think of the
 
02:52:50.819 --> 02:52:51.830 align:start position:0%
um our I'm still trying to think of the
word

02:52:51.830 --> 02:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
word
 
02:52:55.010 --> 02:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
um with their own health care in fact uh
 
02:52:59.570 --> 02:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
regular Medicare has far fewer denials
 
02:53:03.050 --> 02:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
far fewer interferences than the
 
02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage plans which is which
 
02:53:08.450 --> 02:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
is a privatized form of it's not even
 
02:53:10.490 --> 02:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
Medicare privatized form of insurance
 
02:53:12.290 --> 02:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
for older people
 
02:53:15.290 --> 02:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
and and so uh one of the ways in which
 
02:53:18.290 --> 02:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
those private companies make money is by
 
02:53:21.830 --> 02:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
having people contribute to their plans
 
02:53:24.170 --> 02:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
and then not paying out
 
02:53:26.510 --> 02:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and I call that sort of Fun Size
 
02:53:28.849 --> 02:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
health insurance uh you know those
 
02:53:31.130 --> 02:53:31.140 align:start position:0%
little fun size candies it takes longer
 
02:53:32.750 --> 02:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
to unwrap them than it does to eat them
 
02:53:34.429 --> 02:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
you had a single bite from it and that's
 
02:53:36.769 --> 02:53:36.779 align:start position:0%
kind of what happens in private care and
 
02:53:38.809 --> 02:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
and here in New Hampshire we we've
 
02:53:41.809 --> 02:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
championed private care we have among
 
02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
more private care per citizen then just
 
02:53:46.490 --> 02:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
about anybody else in New England and
 
02:53:48.650 --> 02:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
what do we get for it what we get for it
 
02:53:51.410 --> 02:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
is we have the highest the premium costs
 
02:53:54.650 --> 02:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
the highest deductibles okay and the
 
02:53:56.809 --> 02:53:56.819 align:start position:0%
highest co-pays we also have among the
 
02:53:59.990 --> 02:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
highest denials of actual care so we get
 
02:54:02.450 --> 02:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
the worst care possible of all of New
 
02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
England for championing private
 
02:54:07.429 --> 02:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
insurance and so what are we afraid of
 
02:54:10.250 --> 02:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
we're afraid of well we're afraid of the
 
02:54:12.230 --> 02:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
government saying look you know let's
 
02:54:14.450 --> 02:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
let people and doctors get along with
 
02:54:16.370 --> 02:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
each other and and not interfere with
 
02:54:19.070 --> 02:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
them which is what what we're suggesting
 
02:54:22.010 --> 02:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
here so uh
 
02:54:24.230 --> 02:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know the whole idea of premiums is
 
02:54:26.330 --> 02:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
that gets you in the door to to
 
02:54:29.269 --> 02:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
insurance but getting in the door isn't
 
02:54:30.349 --> 02:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
good enough because then you have to pay
 
02:54:31.910 --> 02:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
for a deductible what's a deductible
 
02:54:34.130 --> 02:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
that's additional money that they're not
 
02:54:36.290 --> 02:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
charging for the premiums and when the
 
02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
deductibles go up it basically says the
 
02:54:40.010 --> 02:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
insurance company is saying look we're
 
02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to pay you even we're going to pay
 
02:54:44.210 --> 02:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
even less you've got to be in the
 
02:54:47.570 --> 02:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
forgive the pun for candies but sweet
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
spot when it comes to Health Care you've
 
02:54:52.910 --> 02:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
got to be able to make the make the
 
02:54:54.530 --> 02:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
amount of money back from your premiums
 
02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
make the amount of money back from your
 
02:54:58.610 --> 02:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
deductibles make the co-pay for your
 
02:55:01.130 --> 02:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
hospital or doctor or whatever it is and
 
02:55:03.590 --> 02:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
then your health problem has to be
 
02:55:05.809 --> 02:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
serious enough to cover all of those
 
02:55:08.450 --> 02:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
expenses but not too expensive because
 
02:55:10.790 --> 02:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
you have a cap that if you go over it it
 
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
comes out of your pocket as well and and
 
02:55:16.010 --> 02:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
so that's fun-sized insurance and that's
 
02:55:18.170 --> 02:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
going to only get worse we're looking to
 
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
get away from that okay we're looking to
 
02:55:24.769 --> 02:55:24.779 align:start position:0%
say look let's let's let the doctors and
 
02:55:27.349 --> 02:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
the patients get closer together so that
 
02:55:28.849 --> 02:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
there's less interference from other
 
02:55:30.590 --> 02:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
outside sources whether it's the
 
02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:31.610 align:start position:0%
outside sources whether it's the
government

02:55:31.610 --> 02:55:31.620 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:55:34.190 --> 02:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
or whether it's private care and so yes
 
02:55:35.630 --> 02:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a little bit of
 
02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
government only to regulate it to make
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
sure that doctors are doing what they're
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to do and hospitals are doing
 
02:55:42.530 --> 02:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to do but beyond
 
02:55:45.410 --> 02:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
that we're saying look let's let's get
 
02:55:47.630 --> 02:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
this right let's make sure that Health
 
02:55:50.570 --> 02:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
Care is is more available and cheaper
 
02:55:53.450 --> 02:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
and when you have a Single Payer type of
 
02:55:56.330 --> 02:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
system everything else goes away you no
 
02:55:58.490 --> 02:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
longer have to worry about Medicare or
 
02:56:01.309 --> 02:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid it's already covered you don't
 
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
have people putting things off until
 
02:56:06.050 --> 02:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
they get desperately sick that now it's
 
02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
going to cost us more money to fix
 
02:56:11.929 --> 02:56:11.939 align:start position:0%
and that's basically a nutshell what
 
02:56:14.690 --> 02:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
this is asking to do except as Thomas
 
02:56:16.429 --> 02:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
pointed out earlier
 
02:56:18.650 --> 02:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
we don't even want to get it to kick in
 
02:56:21.469 --> 02:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
until it becomes something that this
 
02:56:23.170 --> 02:56:23.180 align:start position:0%
state can handle
 
02:56:25.849 --> 02:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
especially this state because we don't
 
02:56:29.510 --> 02:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
have a a an income tax we want to keep
 
02:56:30.769 --> 02:56:30.779 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
02:56:33.889 --> 02:56:33.899 align:start position:0%
so let's co-opt with other states which
 
02:56:36.410 --> 02:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
are very much interested in this so that
 
02:56:38.330 --> 02:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
we can make it affordable for our own
 
02:56:40.610 --> 02:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
citizens this is why it's especially
 
02:56:42.530 --> 02:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
important in this state to do
 
02:56:45.170 --> 02:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
I'll entertain any questions you have
 
02:56:46.670 --> 02:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
all right any questions from the
 
02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:49.190 align:start position:0%
all right any questions from the
committee

02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:51.769 --> 02:56:51.779 align:start position:0%
question my testimony oh I'm sorry yeah
 
02:56:54.769 --> 02:56:54.779 align:start position:0%
question so how would your Universal
 
02:56:57.590 --> 02:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
Health Care coexist with the Affordable
 
02:56:59.929 --> 02:56:59.939 align:start position:0%
Care Act That was supposed to solve some
 
02:57:01.969 --> 02:57:01.979 align:start position:0%
of these problems you know one of the
 
02:57:03.530 --> 02:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
things that happened in Massachusetts
 
02:57:06.230 --> 02:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
because they did something similar in
 
02:57:08.510 --> 02:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
terms of uh with their health care under
 
02:57:10.969 --> 02:57:10.979 align:start position:0%
Mitt Romney
 
02:57:14.630 --> 02:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
and uh and they actually got uh they got
 
02:57:18.170 --> 02:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
waivers from CMS and other places to be
 
02:57:20.929 --> 02:57:20.939 align:start position:0%
able to do it their way and and so the
 
02:57:22.730 --> 02:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
same thing would happen here
 
02:57:25.190 --> 02:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
um this we're taking it out of there's
 
02:57:27.469 --> 02:57:27.479 align:start position:0%
no National system but we're taking it
 
02:57:30.110 --> 02:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
out of what is National and we're we're
 
02:57:33.410 --> 02:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
making it our own our own as far as uh
 
02:57:37.670 --> 02:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:39.530 --> 02:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your question
 
02:57:41.389 --> 02:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for Testimony seeing no more
 
02:57:45.710 --> 02:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
questions we'll call uh Dr Donald kolish

I realized that our system of insurance
 
02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:23.210 align:start position:0%
I realized that our system of insurance
coverage

02:58:23.210 --> 02:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
02:58:25.309 --> 02:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
just didn't work
 
02:58:27.230 --> 02:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
too many people postponed care and
 
02:58:28.490 --> 02:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
suffered because they didn't have
 
02:58:28.500 --> 02:58:29.690 align:start position:0%
suffered because they didn't have
coverage

02:58:29.690 --> 02:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
02:58:32.809 --> 02:58:32.819 align:start position:0%
things are better with the ACA
 
02:58:34.849 --> 02:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:58:37.490 --> 02:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
six to eight percent of New Hampshire
 
02:58:39.769 --> 02:58:39.779 align:start position:0%
residents are still without coverage
 
02:58:43.190 --> 02:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
and because much of the ACA was written
 
02:58:48.889 --> 02:58:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:52.130 --> 02:58:52.140 align:start position:0%
coverage through the ACA still has
 
02:58:55.610 --> 02:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
between 20 and 30 percent overhead as
 
02:58:57.889 --> 02:58:57.899 align:start position:0%
compared to two to four percent in
 
02:58:59.870 --> 02:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicare
 
02:59:02.630 --> 02:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
so the ACA was in the right direction
 
02:59:02.640 --> 02:59:04.130 align:start position:0%
so the ACA was in the right direction
but

02:59:04.130 --> 02:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:59:06.650 --> 02:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
um hasn't gone far enough
 
02:59:08.750 --> 02:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
I do believe that a system of Universal
 
02:59:12.349 --> 02:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
Insurance like Medicare would be best
 
02:59:14.809 --> 02:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire is too small to have a
 
02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
single system work we're just too small
 
02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
with 1.3 million people
 
02:59:22.610 --> 02:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
I support HP 353 because a multi-state
 
02:59:24.710 --> 02:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
compact will achieve the economies of
 
02:59:27.050 --> 02:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
scale while retaining our state's
 
02:59:29.809 --> 02:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
ability to craft a system that works for
 
02:59:32.690 --> 02:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:34.309 --> 02:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
and that's the end of my testimony I'd
 
02:59:35.750 --> 02:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions thank you
 
02:59:38.030 --> 02:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
nice and short any questions from the
 
02:59:38.040 --> 02:59:40.309 align:start position:0%
nice and short any questions from the
committee

02:59:40.309 --> 02:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
I think we're good to go thank you very
 
02:59:43.070 --> 02:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your written
 
02:59:43.080 --> 02:59:48.349 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your written
testimony

02:59:48.349 --> 02:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:48.359 --> 02:59:49.790 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:59:49.790 --> 02:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:59:52.250 --> 02:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
Catherine Smith
 
02:59:57.410 --> 02:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:05.330 --> 03:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:08.389 --> 03:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
so my name is Catherine Smith and um I
 
03:00:10.309 --> 03:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
have a very different perspective hold
 
03:00:12.469 --> 03:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
the mic as close as you can my name is
 
03:00:14.870 --> 03:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
Catherine Smith and um I have a very
 
03:00:17.210 --> 03:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
different perspective I'm a home care
 
03:00:19.849 --> 03:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
hospice nurse and I get to kind of see
 
03:00:22.670 --> 03:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
what everybody thinks look good on paper
 
03:00:26.690 --> 03:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
play out in reality in people's lives
 
03:00:29.150 --> 03:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
and it's not
 
03:00:30.889 --> 03:00:30.899 align:start position:0%
consistent at all
 
03:00:33.710 --> 03:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
but that's not my van my my angle here
 
03:00:36.530 --> 03:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
my angle here is to look at the some
 
03:00:39.050 --> 03:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
specifics of the bill
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
um so I did write something I'm a
 
03:00:43.429 --> 03:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
landowner taxpayer of State of New
 
03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I've taken into serious
 
03:00:48.530 --> 03:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
consideration House Bill 353 introduced
 
03:00:50.269 --> 03:00:50.279 align:start position:0%
in the regular session titled
 
03:00:52.610 --> 03:00:52.620 align:start position:0%
establishing an interstate compact for
 
03:00:54.769 --> 03:00:54.779 align:start position:0%
Universal Health Care
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
so we've been told it's not Universal
 
03:01:00.170 --> 03:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
Health Care but it's right in the title
 
03:01:03.469 --> 03:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
we um I'm conceiving that the same if
 
03:01:04.969 --> 03:01:04.979 align:start position:0%
finally armed with the sanctions of an
 
03:01:06.710 --> 03:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
act will be dangerous abuse of power and
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
a violation of the limits of
 
03:01:09.530 --> 03:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
governmental power established in the
 
03:01:12.349 --> 03:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution Bill of Rights adopted June
 
03:01:14.110 --> 03:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
2nd 19
 
03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
1784 acts 7 article 7 State sovereignty
 
03:01:21.050 --> 03:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
says the people of the state have the
 
03:01:22.790 --> 03:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
sole and exclusive right of governing
 
03:01:25.190 --> 03:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
themselves as a free solvent and
 
03:01:27.650 --> 03:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
independent state and do and forever
 
03:01:30.050 --> 03:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
Hereafter shall exercise and enjoy every
 
03:01:32.389 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
Power jurisdiction and right pertaining
 
03:01:34.750 --> 03:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
thereto which is not or may not
 
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
Hereafter be by them expressly delegated
 
03:01:39.410 --> 03:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
to the United States of American
 
03:01:42.110 --> 03:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
Congress in Congress assembled
 
03:01:44.510 --> 03:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
so I believe government should have
 
03:01:46.849 --> 03:01:46.859 align:start position:0%
minimal involvement in health care and
 
03:01:48.349 --> 03:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is first step towards
 
03:01:50.090 --> 03:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
socialized medicine as it seeks to
 
03:01:50.929 --> 03:01:50.939 align:start position:0%
create a completely
 
03:01:52.750 --> 03:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
government-controlled Health Care System
 
03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
Beginning by creating an interstate
 
03:01:58.190 --> 03:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
compact via the compact trust fund
 
03:02:00.410 --> 03:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
additionally upon serious consideration
 
03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
of section V 404-k
 
03:02:07.490 --> 03:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
colon 4 it says eligibility
 
03:02:10.910 --> 03:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
each beneficiary shall be issued
 
03:02:13.790 --> 03:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
a compact health insurance card with a
 
03:02:16.309 --> 03:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
unique identifying number and any other
 
03:02:18.650 --> 03:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
relevant information the board or its
 
03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%

03:02:21.359 --> 03:02:23.870 align:start position:0%

and

03:02:23.870 --> 03:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:26.030 --> 03:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
conceiving the same if finally armed
 
03:02:27.650 --> 03:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
with the sanctions of an act will be a
 
03:02:29.330 --> 03:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
dangerous abuse of power and a violation
 
03:02:31.130 --> 03:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
of the limits of Government powers as
 
03:02:33.230 --> 03:02:33.240 align:start position:0%

with the sanctions of an act will it be
 
03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:13.200 align:start position:0%

03:04:44.809 --> 03:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
connection but anytime
 
03:04:50.630 --> 03:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:52.910 --> 03:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
that says right here the facility shall
 
03:04:54.410 --> 03:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
meet federal and state quality and
 
03:04:56.330 --> 03:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
Licensing guidelines including those for
 
03:04:58.969 --> 03:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
safe Staffing ratios and career these
 
03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
facilities are beholden to Medicare
 
03:05:03.469 --> 03:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations in order for
 
03:05:05.809 --> 03:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
participation who's beholden to the
 
03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:08.160 align:start position:0%

03:05:16.490 --> 03:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
looks like we have autonomy we do not we
 
03:05:19.389 --> 03:05:19.399 align:start position:0%
are controlled by outside forces
 
03:05:23.210 --> 03:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
non-governmental elected officials
 
03:05:25.309 --> 03:05:25.319 align:start position:0%

03:05:26.809 --> 03:05:26.819 align:start position:0%

03:05:48.110 --> 03:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
John okay all right uh and we don't have

foreign

03:56:34.610 --> 03:56:34.620 align:start position:0%

Emily Phillips

03:57:08.030 --> 03:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh we passed out some
 
03:57:08.040 --> 03:57:08.990 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh we passed out some
copies

03:57:08.990 --> 03:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
copies
 
03:57:10.849 --> 03:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
um for the committee
 
03:57:12.650 --> 03:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
um on some backup on what I'll be
 
03:57:15.790 --> 03:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
speaking about but the um
 
03:57:19.429 --> 03:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
this uh legislation the purpose of it is
 
03:57:21.170 --> 03:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
to require Health Care Facilities to
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
disclose prices for certain items and
 
03:57:25.250 --> 03:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
services provided by certain medical
 
03:57:25.260 --> 03:57:26.570 align:start position:0%
services provided by certain medical
facilities

03:57:26.570 --> 03:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
03:57:28.729 --> 03:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
um in prohibit Collective action of debt
 
03:57:31.490 --> 03:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
for non-compliant facilities there is a
 
03:57:33.110 --> 03:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
federal law in place
 
03:57:33.120 --> 03:57:33.769 align:start position:0%
federal law in place
um

03:57:33.769 --> 03:57:33.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:35.990 --> 03:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to hold hospitals
 
03:57:37.550 --> 03:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
accountable for not complying with that
 
03:57:39.130 --> 03:57:39.140 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
03:57:41.389 --> 03:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
there are two states that have passed
 
03:57:42.830 --> 03:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
similar legislation which I'm sure
 
03:57:44.510 --> 03:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
someone else will speak on but uh this
 
03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
law would further encourage compliance
 
03:57:49.550 --> 03:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
by hospitals by preventing collection of
 
03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
non-payment from patients if the
 
03:57:53.689 --> 03:57:53.699 align:start position:0%
hospital is not in compliance with
 
03:57:56.229 --> 03:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
transparency requirements
 
03:57:59.269 --> 03:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
for too long the price of Health Care
 
03:58:01.370 --> 03:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
at hospitals has been shrouded from
 
03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
patients leaving them with unexpected
 
03:58:03.359 --> 03:58:04.429 align:start position:0%
patients leaving them with unexpected
bills

03:58:04.429 --> 03:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
bills
 
03:58:07.490 --> 03:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
long after they receive care the lack of
 
03:58:09.349 --> 03:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
transparency leaves patients in the dark
 
03:58:11.450 --> 03:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
and renders them unable to make informed
 
03:58:13.130 --> 03:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
decisions about where and when to
 
03:58:15.170 --> 03:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
receive care efforts to improve
 
03:58:17.689 --> 03:58:17.699 align:start position:0%
transparency are bipartisan and aim to
 
03:58:19.849 --> 03:58:19.859 align:start position:0%
increase consumer knowledge increase
 
03:58:22.490 --> 03:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
competition and put downward pressure on
 
03:58:24.410 --> 03:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
the prices of medical devices and
 
03:58:24.420 --> 03:58:25.210 align:start position:0%
the prices of medical devices and
Services

03:58:25.210 --> 03:58:25.220 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:58:27.469 --> 03:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
I believe in a free market and I think
 
03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
competition would be healthy here and if
 
03:58:33.769 --> 03:58:33.779 align:start position:0%
it's all shrouded behind darkness and
 
03:58:35.870 --> 03:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
the patients can't see prices then we
 
03:58:38.510 --> 03:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't have that here Hospital compliance
 
03:58:41.689 --> 03:58:41.699 align:start position:0%
with this rule since last year has been
 
03:58:43.969 --> 03:58:43.979 align:start position:0%
subpar since it took effect last year
 
03:58:46.490 --> 03:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
only 53 percent of hospitals in the U.S
 
03:58:49.670 --> 03:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
disclosed any prices and an estimated 14
 
03:58:52.490 --> 03:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
percent were in full compliance in your
 
03:58:55.010 --> 03:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
attached packets we have
 
03:58:56.990 --> 03:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
two recent articles that were published
 
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
this month saying that most hospitals
 
03:59:02.150 --> 03:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
are not compliant I mean up upwards of
 
03:59:03.950 --> 03:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know near 80 percent are not
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
complying with full price transparency
 
03:59:09.050 --> 03:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
guidelines and then I have a specific to
 
03:59:11.330 --> 03:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
our state in New Hampshire this
 
03:59:14.030 --> 03:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
breakdown of hospitals that an
 
03:59:16.189 --> 03:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
independent Group Patient rights
 
03:59:18.050 --> 03:59:18.060 align:start position:0%
Advocate had pulled
 
03:59:20.210 --> 03:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
um downloadable data on their websites
 
03:59:21.710 --> 03:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
and they are not compliant you can see
 
03:59:22.849 --> 03:59:22.859 align:start position:0%
you can go through them I actually
 
03:59:25.790 --> 03:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
called for hospitals in my area from
 
03:59:28.370 --> 03:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
Fremont and found that one out of
 
03:59:31.490 --> 03:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
for we're compliant so it is a real
 
03:59:34.130 --> 03:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
issue here so people want to shop online
 
03:59:36.889 --> 03:59:36.899 align:start position:0%
and find prices for a shoppable service
 
03:59:38.929 --> 03:59:38.939 align:start position:0%
like a knee replacement or a mammogram
 
03:59:40.670 --> 03:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy and they're not able to get
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
the data that they're required to
 
03:59:45.469 --> 03:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
provide through the federal law on a
 
03:59:48.769 --> 03:59:48.779 align:start position:0%
personal level I am a type 1 diabetic so
 
03:59:50.330 --> 03:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty familiar with navigating the
 
03:59:54.110 --> 03:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
healthcare system to get quotes my son
 
03:59:56.750 --> 03:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
needed to be sedated for a dental
 
04:00:00.110 --> 04:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
procedure and I was quoted One Rate
 
04:00:02.330 --> 04:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
through my dental insurance and then I
 
04:00:04.490 --> 04:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
was quoted a rate somewhere between two
 
04:00:06.110 --> 04:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
to three thousand dollars to have a one
 
04:00:08.269 --> 04:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
hour procedure of sedation at a local
 
04:00:08.279 --> 04:00:10.010 align:start position:0%
hour procedure of sedation at a local
hospital

04:00:10.010 --> 04:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
04:00:13.670 --> 04:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
um this was in 2019 so it was before the
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
um federal law went into place but that
 
04:00:17.389 --> 04:00:17.399 align:start position:0%
two to three thousand dollars became
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
twenty four thousand dollars
 
04:00:21.410 --> 04:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
and that's what I was billed so and I
 
04:00:22.849 --> 04:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
think I was pretty educated and I tried
 
04:00:24.290 --> 04:00:24.300 align:start position:0%
to get all the information but they
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
surprised us and then they are allowed
 
04:00:27.889 --> 04:00:27.899 align:start position:0%
to do out of pocket I'm sorry out of
 
04:00:29.689 --> 04:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
network providers or they do the
 
04:00:31.610 --> 04:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
anesthesia fee plus the facility fee
 
04:00:33.950 --> 04:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
plus the or fee and it's very hard to
 
04:00:35.929 --> 04:00:35.939 align:start position:0%
get information from these people so if
 
04:00:38.450 --> 04:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
we had it all online My Hope Is that the
 
04:00:39.769 --> 04:00:39.779 align:start position:0%
transparency would be there and I could
 
04:00:41.330 --> 04:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
shop services and everyone else could
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
help reduce prices across the board
 
04:00:44.399 --> 04:00:44.929 align:start position:0%
help reduce prices across the board
um

04:00:44.929 --> 04:00:44.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:47.450 --> 04:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
that's all I have I think is I'm open to
 
04:00:50.269 --> 04:00:50.279 align:start position:0%
questions of course did we talk we
 
04:00:52.370 --> 04:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
talked did I tell you we talk about the
 
04:00:54.769 --> 04:00:54.779 align:start position:0%
insurance department has this available
 
04:00:57.170 --> 04:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
I saw that there's a public website so
 
04:00:59.269 --> 04:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
there are other states um Colorado who
 
04:01:00.469 --> 04:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
has a nice
 
04:01:03.050 --> 04:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
um a private provider of a website that
 
04:01:04.790 --> 04:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
is more
 
04:01:06.830 --> 04:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and all-encompassing and you can kind
 
04:01:08.269 --> 04:01:08.279 align:start position:0%
of put in your insurance information and
 
04:01:10.610 --> 04:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
all of that so I'm not sure nobody can
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
be better than ours I think privatizing
 
04:01:15.950 --> 04:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
some things is better than uh case this
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
case we were able to gather the
 
04:01:21.530 --> 04:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
information for
 
04:01:25.670 --> 04:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
The Physician and the hospital so that
 
04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
we could get so that when you look at
 
04:01:30.349 --> 04:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
the price you can really see the total
 
04:01:30.359 --> 04:01:31.250 align:start position:0%
the price you can really see the total
price

04:01:31.250 --> 04:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
price
 
04:01:34.370 --> 04:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
of what that procedure will cost at any
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
given Hospital
 
04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is that what I
 
04:01:40.130 --> 04:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
just presented is not true and they're
 
04:01:42.590 --> 04:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
all compliant all the hospitals
 
04:01:45.170 --> 04:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
um in terms of what the compliance
 
04:01:46.370 --> 04:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
because I know we did talk about that
 
04:01:50.710 --> 04:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
issue and I heard there was some uh
 
04:01:53.330 --> 04:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
pushback in terms of what they're
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
tracking what they're trying so in this
 
04:01:58.429 --> 04:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
case what I was telling you is
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of the hospital themselves
 
04:02:03.290 --> 04:02:03.300 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire on its
 
04:02:05.330 --> 04:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
Insurance Department's web page
 
04:02:08.150 --> 04:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
you can go in and you can type in the
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
procedure that you want you know I'm
 
04:02:13.849 --> 04:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
I have to do that Colin Haas could be
 
04:02:16.729 --> 04:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
every five years so I do Leo type it in
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and see you know what the hospital
 
04:02:22.130 --> 04:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to go to anyways to see
 
04:02:24.110 --> 04:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
what they're going to charge and and and
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh and I actually tested this last time
 
04:02:29.210 --> 04:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
just match up when I got billed by my
 
04:02:31.070 --> 04:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
insurance company to see if the dollar
 
04:02:34.670 --> 04:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
amounts followed and they did so uh we
 
04:02:36.769 --> 04:02:36.779 align:start position:0%
actually do it and so it's not as much
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
as that we're regulating the hospitals
 
04:02:40.670 --> 04:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
we were able to get the hospitals to
 
04:02:43.070 --> 04:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
generate that information with the
 
04:02:45.170 --> 04:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
Physicians we can really see the whole
 
04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
cost analysis for each individual
 
04:02:50.689 --> 04:02:50.699 align:start position:0%
hospital for any or I wouldn't say any
 
04:02:52.729 --> 04:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
procedure but for the vast majority of
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
procedures through which people use
 
04:02:56.809 --> 04:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
and I don't think I told you that when
 
04:03:00.650 --> 04:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
we were talking well the the
 
04:03:02.269 --> 04:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
persuasion is to prove to prevent
 
04:03:02.279 --> 04:03:04.729 align:start position:0%
persuasion is to prove to prevent
Hospital

04:03:04.729 --> 04:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:07.490 --> 04:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
with collecting debt
 
04:03:09.410 --> 04:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
so collecting debt so if they are
 
04:03:10.969 --> 04:03:10.979 align:start position:0%
compliant there's no penalty to any
 
04:03:12.530 --> 04:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
Hospital who is compliant with the
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
federal law so what you're saying may be
 
04:03:15.769 --> 04:03:15.779 align:start position:0%
true in your situation but if there is a
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
hospital which according to mid-year of
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
last year there's plenty that are not
 
04:03:21.290 --> 04:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
compliant with the current federal law
 
04:03:23.330 --> 04:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
so yeah actually my Hospital said it was
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
non-compliant you said you're on that
 
04:03:27.469 --> 04:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
list had my hospital is non-compliant
 
04:03:30.590 --> 04:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
right but I but I absolutely was able to
 
04:03:31.969 --> 04:03:31.979 align:start position:0%
get the information from the insurance
 
04:03:31.979 --> 04:03:33.349 align:start position:0%
get the information from the insurance
department

04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:03:35.929 --> 04:03:35.939 align:start position:0%
okay what if we're self-pay what if I
 
04:03:37.309 --> 04:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance you can still look
 
04:03:39.050 --> 04:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
that's actually what the numbers are it
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
would have been the self-pay number it
 
04:03:42.849 --> 04:03:42.859 align:start position:0%
would have been that it's because
 
04:03:44.809 --> 04:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
obviously with your insurance company
 
04:03:47.450 --> 04:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
you then have a lower
 
04:03:49.550 --> 04:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
payment so in my case because it was a
 
04:03:51.130 --> 04:03:51.140 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy that I was looking at
 
04:03:54.590 --> 04:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
colonoscopies uh are free because uh
 
04:03:57.650 --> 04:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
they're preventative medicine so uh but
 
04:03:59.570 --> 04:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
it's still I was I wanted to see that
 
04:04:01.010 --> 04:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
dollar amount to see if it really
 
04:04:04.729 --> 04:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
carried over and it did carry over but
 
04:04:04.739 --> 04:04:06.290 align:start position:0%
carried over and it did carry over but
um

04:04:06.290 --> 04:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:08.809 --> 04:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
so is there a question or no no I'm just
 
04:04:10.189 --> 04:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
saying would you believe yeah would you
 
04:04:11.510 --> 04:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
believe there is a way you can do this
 
04:04:14.210 --> 04:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
through our insurance department
 
04:04:16.370 --> 04:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
I I believe that this is a real issue
 
04:04:18.050 --> 04:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
affecting Granite Staters and I think
 
04:04:20.330 --> 04:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
that the hospitals in the Granite State
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
Should comply with the federal law and
 
04:04:23.150 --> 04:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
there should be a consequence if they
 
04:04:23.160 --> 04:04:23.990 align:start position:0%
there should be a consequence if they
don't

04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:04:25.849 --> 04:04:25.859 align:start position:0%
gotcha and that's what this is okay
 
04:04:28.910 --> 04:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:31.130 --> 04:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
as I understand that from reviewing the
 
04:04:33.590 --> 04:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
proposal there is no enforcement
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism through the statute we're a
 
04:04:38.210 --> 04:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
hospital to Bill
 
04:04:40.670 --> 04:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
nothing happens according to the statute
 
04:04:42.830 --> 04:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
what enforcement mechanism do you
 
04:04:45.349 --> 04:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
envision as occurring as a result of a
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
hospital violating the statute
 
04:04:50.630 --> 04:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
so as it's written now it would not be
 
04:04:52.370 --> 04:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
collectible they could not take a
 
04:04:54.830 --> 04:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
patient to court to collections or
 
04:04:56.929 --> 04:04:56.939 align:start position:0%
pursue any collection activity
 
04:04:59.809 --> 04:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
but so yeah so the penalty is that you
 
04:05:01.490 --> 04:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay the bill
 
04:05:04.429 --> 04:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
for the question as a follow-up
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
and then if they do what happens there
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be an enforcement mechanism for
 
04:05:11.090 --> 04:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
somebody who breaks the law
 
04:05:11.100 --> 04:05:13.550 align:start position:0%
somebody who breaks the law
foreign

04:05:13.550 --> 04:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:05:16.130 --> 04:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
if if the committee is interested we
 
04:05:18.530 --> 04:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
have a pre-written amendment that would
 
04:05:22.130 --> 04:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
allow DHHS to find hospitals for
 
04:05:22.140 --> 04:05:23.750 align:start position:0%
allow DHHS to find hospitals for
non-compliance

04:05:23.750 --> 04:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
non-compliance
 
04:05:25.490 --> 04:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
so it would go into the general fund and
 
04:05:26.750 --> 04:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
they could set their own you like that
 
04:05:29.330 --> 04:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
yes okay so we have we haven't answered
 
04:05:31.490 --> 04:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
his question yes so we have an amendment
 
04:05:31.500 --> 04:05:32.689 align:start position:0%
his question yes so we have an amendment
drafted

04:05:32.689 --> 04:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
um I can pass that around maybe
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
because like I said Colorado and Texas
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
had similar legislation pass and I think
 
04:05:42.830 --> 04:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
there's others in draft right now but uh
 
04:05:44.210 --> 04:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:05:46.130 --> 04:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
you know nice to have some Revenue
 
04:05:48.170 --> 04:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
stream for especially hospitals who
 
04:05:50.150 --> 04:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
continue to not comply per day or what
 
04:05:52.490 --> 04:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
have you in the amendment I believe
 
04:05:54.769 --> 04:05:54.779 align:start position:0%
there is a no there isn't okay we're
 
04:05:57.170 --> 04:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
gonna allow DHHS to set their own
 
04:05:59.210 --> 04:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
um penalties whether it be a thousand
 
04:06:01.429 --> 04:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
dollars a day or what have you
 
04:06:01.439 --> 04:06:02.150 align:start position:0%
dollars a day or what have you
um

04:06:02.150 --> 04:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:06.290 --> 04:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
there is a corrective Action Program
 
04:06:08.090 --> 04:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
a plan to be submitted if they're found
 
04:06:10.550 --> 04:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
to be non-compliant so in this example
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
the patient would report it to DHHS that
 
04:06:15.710 --> 04:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
this hospital did not
 
04:06:18.229 --> 04:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
comply with the price transparency laws
 
04:06:20.030 --> 04:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
on this date and offered me services and
 
04:06:22.309 --> 04:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
now they're trying to collect
 
04:06:24.110 --> 04:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:06:26.030 --> 04:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
the rest of the amendment would
 
04:06:29.210 --> 04:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
show that all right representative Terry
 
04:06:33.530 --> 04:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
as sometimes uh is the case I'm confused
 
04:06:35.210 --> 04:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
so I would appreciate if you could
 
04:06:35.220 --> 04:06:36.309 align:start position:0%
so I would appreciate if you could
clarify

04:06:36.309 --> 04:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps by explaining uh what
 
04:06:43.729 --> 04:06:43.739 align:start position:0%
non-compliance means because what I have
 
04:06:43.739 --> 04:06:44.870 align:start position:0%
non-compliance means because what I have
heard

04:06:44.870 --> 04:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:06:49.250 --> 04:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
is Chairman indicating that he was able
 
04:06:54.410 --> 04:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
to go on the State Insurance website and
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
find the cost for a procedure at a
 
04:06:59.929 --> 04:06:59.939 align:start position:0%
particular Hospital which in fact turned
 
04:07:01.969 --> 04:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
out to be the cost for that procedure
 
04:07:05.170 --> 04:07:05.180 align:start position:0%
and yet the hospital is listed as being
 
04:07:08.330 --> 04:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
non-compliant is that what I heard and
 
04:07:11.450 --> 04:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
if I did could you explain how the
 
04:07:13.910 --> 04:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
hospital could be non-compliant if at
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
the root of this is the requirement to
 
04:07:19.490 --> 04:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
post prices for procedures and the
 
04:07:21.410 --> 04:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
chairman indicated that he was able to
 
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
find the price for the procedure at the
 
04:07:25.969 --> 04:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
hospital that is identified as
 
04:07:28.309 --> 04:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
non-compliant thank you
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'll try to unwrap that so
 
04:07:33.830 --> 04:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
um the final rule the federal law uh
 
04:07:35.389 --> 04:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
required hospitals to publish machine
 
04:07:37.849 --> 04:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
readable file of five types of standard
 
04:07:40.490 --> 04:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
charges for all items and services and a
 
04:07:42.410 --> 04:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
create a consumer-friendly shoppable
 
04:07:44.750 --> 04:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
list of 300 items and services included
 
04:07:49.250 --> 04:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
including 70 identified by CMS centers
 
04:07:53.330 --> 04:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid and Medicaid services so
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
um there are certain levels there's
 
04:07:56.090 --> 04:07:56.100 align:start position:0%
people who are partially compliant
 
04:07:57.710 --> 04:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
they're doing some of it
 
04:07:59.450 --> 04:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
um you know user-friendly machine
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
readable available those are all terms
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
that are defined
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
um in I don't think I've provided that
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
that documentation with it
 
04:08:10.250 --> 04:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
oh in the amen and the amendment and the
 
04:08:10.260 --> 04:08:11.210 align:start position:0%
oh in the amen and the amendment and the
amendment

04:08:11.210 --> 04:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:08:15.050 --> 04:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:16.849 --> 04:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
there's a good explanation on this chart
 
04:08:18.769 --> 04:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire of why they were
 
04:08:21.170 --> 04:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
found to be non-compliant like the files
 
04:08:24.889 --> 04:08:24.899 align:start position:0%
were not broken down into the three you
 
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
know private pay cash pay or Medicaid
 
04:08:31.610 --> 04:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
charges that sort of thing so um I'm not
 
04:08:33.950 --> 04:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
sure I can't speak to repon's experience
 
04:08:36.650 --> 04:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
as to why it worked for him it is a real
 
04:08:38.990 --> 04:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
issue I don't I guess what he's asking
 
04:08:41.870 --> 04:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
is who is the judge
 
04:08:44.929 --> 04:08:44.939 align:start position:0%
who is the determinant that they're in
 
04:08:44.939 --> 04:08:46.670 align:start position:0%
who is the determinant that they're in
non-compliant

04:08:46.670 --> 04:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
non-compliant
 
04:08:48.769 --> 04:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
well actually no that's that's not your
 
04:08:50.269 --> 04:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
question I'd be happy to hear the answer
 
04:08:52.130 --> 04:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
to that question and then if you'd give
 
04:08:54.969 --> 04:08:54.979 align:start position:0%
me a follow-up I will clarify
 
04:08:57.469 --> 04:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire do you
 
04:09:00.530 --> 04:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
want your answer no no I'm okay you're
 
04:09:02.570 --> 04:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
going where you're going so is it
 
04:09:03.530 --> 04:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
possible that we have different
 
04:09:05.809 --> 04:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
standards here such that the hospital
 
04:09:08.389 --> 04:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
was able to meet the state standard and
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
and and be in compliance by posting the
 
04:09:13.849 --> 04:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
prices to the State Insurance
 
04:09:15.889 --> 04:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
Department's website but it was not in
 
04:09:17.929 --> 04:09:17.939 align:start position:0%
compliance with the different Federal
 
04:09:20.269 --> 04:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
standards for compliance it may be
 
04:09:21.910 --> 04:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
possible I'm not familiar with the state
 
04:09:25.610 --> 04:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
insurance page that he spoke about
 
04:09:27.410 --> 04:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I do not I'm not an expert on that so
 
04:09:30.410 --> 04:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know what they provide okay
 
04:09:32.330 --> 04:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you but um the person who
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
determined whether someone would be in
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
compliance would be a a judge if the
 
04:09:37.790 --> 04:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
person was brought to collections in
 
04:09:40.189 --> 04:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
court okay and then in the amendment
 
04:09:42.170 --> 04:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
DHHS would be the one to determine
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not they complied
 
04:09:46.130 --> 04:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
I would this be a administrative action
 
04:09:55.370 --> 04:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
or would this be a legal action I think
 
04:09:56.990 --> 04:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
you mean this would be an administrative
 
04:09:58.610 --> 04:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
action correct
 
04:10:00.889 --> 04:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
correct administrative
 
04:10:03.950 --> 04:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative Walsh
 
04:10:06.110 --> 04:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:10:09.530 --> 04:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
provided this as well I'm just I opened
 
04:10:12.530 --> 04:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
it and it's talking about uh leopard
 
04:10:15.969 --> 04:10:15.979 align:start position:0%
battle tanks to the Ukraine really
 
04:10:20.030 --> 04:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
and it sure it sure is now and and
 
04:10:21.889 --> 04:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
something about Republicans in the
 
04:10:23.689 --> 04:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
Senate and so I was just wondering what
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
what happened it's a bit of a
 
04:10:27.469 --> 04:10:27.479 align:start position:0%
non-secretory I apologize but I just
 
04:10:31.870 --> 04:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
I'll have to I will send the committee
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
the copy of the article I sent it
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
upstairs to have them print all these
 
04:10:39.110 --> 04:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
copies and this is what happened so
 
04:10:40.910 --> 04:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
um when you let the government do things
 
04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
now okay okay I need a tank for my
 
04:10:44.399 --> 04:10:46.490 align:start position:0%
now okay okay I need a tank for my
Hospital

04:10:46.490 --> 04:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
04:10:50.330 --> 04:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
yeah but they were great recent articles
 
04:10:52.969 --> 04:10:52.979 align:start position:0%
supporting the fact or reinforcing the
 
04:10:54.530 --> 04:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
idea that hospitals are not complying
 
04:10:56.150 --> 04:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
with this a year later and it's all over
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
the country it's not just here right
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay so there's a Forbes article in an
 
04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
axios article but I will get the link
 
04:11:04.130 --> 04:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
since that would be great committee
 
04:11:06.469 --> 04:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
04:11:08.150 --> 04:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:11:09.410 --> 04:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:11:11.150 --> 04:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
I guess I actually have two questions
 
04:11:13.189 --> 04:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
but the first one would be so you said
 
04:11:14.689 --> 04:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
that it would be up to the judge to
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not they're in
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
compliance does that mean like I get a
 
04:11:18.410 --> 04:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
bill from
 
04:11:21.950 --> 04:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
whatever hospital and I I can just not
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
pay it and then go see if maybe they're
 
04:11:25.130 --> 04:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
not compliant by going to court is that
 
04:11:26.450 --> 04:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
is that really the mechanism by which
 
04:11:30.410 --> 04:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.990 --> 04:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know about that no I
 
04:11:33.000 --> 04:11:33.830 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know about that no I
mean

04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:11:36.050 --> 04:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
okay so you said earlier that the person
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
who would be in charge of deciding
 
04:11:39.290 --> 04:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
whether or not somebody was in
 
04:11:40.370 --> 04:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
compliance because we don't seem to have
 
04:11:43.490 --> 04:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
like a an authority here in the state so
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
if and the FEDS apparently don't have a
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
way of enforcing it so
 
04:11:50.689 --> 04:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
if if I get a bill from Littleton
 
04:11:51.889 --> 04:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
Hospital is the one that would be close
 
04:11:53.090 --> 04:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
to me
 
04:11:54.889 --> 04:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
I can just say well I don't know if
 
04:11:56.030 --> 04:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
they're in compliance I'm going to just
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
not pay go to court and see what the
 
04:11:59.570 --> 04:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
judge says like is that is that really
 
04:12:01.729 --> 04:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
how how it would work like how how do
 
04:12:03.050 --> 04:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
you see it working if that's not how it
 
04:12:04.849 --> 04:12:04.859 align:start position:0%
works my interpretation would be that
 
04:12:07.490 --> 04:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
could work that way yes okay because it
 
04:12:09.889 --> 04:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
is up to the judge yes okay and then my
 
04:12:11.809 --> 04:12:11.819 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
04:12:13.729 --> 04:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
um my other question is
 
04:12:15.290 --> 04:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
um this is more just a clarification of
 
04:12:16.670 --> 04:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
maybe the federal law that you probably
 
04:12:18.410 --> 04:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
know better than I do but does this
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
apply to just hospitals or like if I'm
 
04:12:20.640 --> 04:12:21.469 align:start position:0%
apply to just hospitals or like if I'm
gonna

04:12:21.469 --> 04:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
04:12:23.090 --> 04:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
go get a colonoscopy from the local
 
04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy Clinic do they also have to
 
04:12:26.689 --> 04:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
put this all online or is this just
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
affecting hospitals specifically it says
 
04:12:30.889 --> 04:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
facility so I'm not really sure if
 
04:12:33.469 --> 04:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
that's what defines a hospital versus a
 
04:12:35.330 --> 04:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
like a day surgery Place type of thing
 
04:12:37.790 --> 04:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I think it would be
 
04:12:39.710 --> 04:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
um maybe um the expert is going to speak
 
04:12:41.090 --> 04:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
about it would know better but I think
 
04:12:43.189 --> 04:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's facilities that could include a day
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
surgery okay thank you
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
represent Ammon
 
04:12:51.469 --> 04:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I thank you for your
 
04:12:51.479 --> 04:12:52.790 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I thank you for your
testimony

04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:12:52.800 --> 04:12:53.450 align:start position:0%
testimony
um

04:12:53.450 --> 04:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:55.370 --> 04:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
could you help me understand the term
 
04:12:58.130 --> 04:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
material compliance
 
04:13:00.229 --> 04:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
um so to me
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh one layer is uh that the information
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
is available and then the second layer
 
04:13:09.889 --> 04:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
would be is it accurate you know is it
 
04:13:12.910 --> 04:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
up to date so how are you thinking about
 
04:13:15.110 --> 04:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
material compliance and Does it include
 
04:13:17.090 --> 04:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
the information being accurate and
 
04:13:17.100 --> 04:13:17.929 align:start position:0%
the information being accurate and
current

04:13:17.929 --> 04:13:17.939 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
and and how is that uh checked
 
04:13:22.849 --> 04:13:22.859 align:start position:0%
um you're referring to the amendment did
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
you read that portion or no the
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
amendment um I defines material
 
04:13:28.910 --> 04:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
compliance means information regarding
 
04:13:31.010 --> 04:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
the cost of items or Services provided
 
04:13:33.469 --> 04:13:33.479 align:start position:0%
by a hospital must be available as a
 
04:13:35.330 --> 04:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
comprehensive machine readable file with
 
04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
all items and services listed and as a
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
display of shoppable services in a
 
04:13:42.050 --> 04:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
consumer-friendly format
 
04:13:45.530 --> 04:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
so that gets to follow please that gets
 
04:13:47.809 --> 04:13:47.819 align:start position:0%
to the question of is it available but
 
04:13:50.450 --> 04:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
not is it current and accurate
 
04:13:53.630 --> 04:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
um what was your thinking on that aspect
 
04:13:55.550 --> 04:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
as far as how much like time you would
 
04:13:57.110 --> 04:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
allow for them to update prices that
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
sort of question how do you know that
 
04:14:00.889 --> 04:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
the price is accurate
 
04:14:05.929 --> 04:14:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean I assume if they
 
04:14:10.429 --> 04:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
bill that price that they had on the
 
04:14:12.410 --> 04:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
website on that day then that would be
 
04:14:12.420 --> 04:14:14.510 align:start position:0%
website on that day then that would be
accurate

04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
04:14:16.370 --> 04:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
I think what he's getting at is saying
 
04:14:18.889 --> 04:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
is that to be compliant with your
 
04:14:20.510 --> 04:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
statute is they could just put anything
 
04:14:23.210 --> 04:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
up and as long as they dotted their eyes
 
04:14:25.250 --> 04:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
and crossed their T's
 
04:14:27.290 --> 04:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
then they'd be in compliance even though
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
the information there's no actual tests
 
04:14:32.090 --> 04:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
to see if the information is correct
 
04:14:33.950 --> 04:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
or accurate
 
04:14:36.550 --> 04:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
so they would put any price
 
04:14:39.950 --> 04:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
they we would assume they wouldn't just
 
04:14:41.809 --> 04:14:41.819 align:start position:0%
wing it right they would they would make
 
04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
a college try at the number but that but
 
04:14:47.710 --> 04:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
that there's no accountability you're
 
04:14:49.849 --> 04:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
the bill is not about accountability
 
04:14:52.250 --> 04:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
that the numbers are accurate that this
 
04:14:55.610 --> 04:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
bill is really all about is did you die
 
04:14:56.929 --> 04:14:56.939 align:start position:0%
are you in compliance with the federal
 
04:14:59.570 --> 04:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
did you dot your eyes cross your t's and
 
04:15:00.889 --> 04:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
that's all we care about we don't really
 
04:15:02.570 --> 04:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
care whether the information is actually
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
accurate if the transparency is just
 
04:15:07.969 --> 04:15:07.979 align:start position:0%
that it's going to breed competition and
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
people are going to shop elsewhere so if
 
04:15:11.570 --> 04:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
they're putting in a price and someone
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
can find a less expensive price or they
 
04:15:16.790 --> 04:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
that they can compare apples to apples I
 
04:15:17.870 --> 04:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
feel like they're not doing themselves
 
04:15:19.849 --> 04:15:19.859 align:start position:0%
any good by
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
I guess that's what I'm following if
 
04:15:22.849 --> 04:15:22.859 align:start position:0%
everyone was complying then you could
 
04:15:25.790 --> 04:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
shop for a colonoscopy right at all the
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
services and you're going to go most
 
04:15:30.050 --> 04:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
likely with a lower cost provider
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the incentive is that you
 
04:15:33.530 --> 04:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
breed competition
 
04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
and that people will go to the provider
 
04:15:39.110 --> 04:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
who has a usable
 
04:15:39.120 --> 04:15:41.050 align:start position:0%
who has a usable
format

04:15:41.050 --> 04:15:41.060 align:start position:0%
format
 
04:15:43.610 --> 04:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
so but is there any part of this bill
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
that then says uh that if it wasn't to
 
04:15:49.729 --> 04:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
the penny if it wasn't that they
 
04:15:51.469 --> 04:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
accurate in other words when they
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
actually did get billed
 
04:15:56.570 --> 04:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
and it was a different dollar amount
 
04:15:58.790 --> 04:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
does the still the department then have
 
04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
to uh be or be responsible for finding
 
04:16:04.429 --> 04:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
them because it turns out the dollar
 
04:16:07.250 --> 04:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
amount was wrong it's an option to find
 
04:16:08.809 --> 04:16:08.819 align:start position:0%
them if they so choose but if they're
 
04:16:10.130 --> 04:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
not they're not complying if they're off
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
by a penny that's correct like because
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
they quoted the price is supposed to be
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
transparent right so they're supposed to
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
be billing what they're posting that's
 
04:16:20.570 --> 04:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
the whole point of transparency got it I
 
04:16:22.610 --> 04:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
think that was what the question was are
 
04:16:23.870 --> 04:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
you a representative Terry are you still
 
04:16:26.929 --> 04:16:26.939 align:start position:0%
so historical accurate means that it's
 
04:16:29.929 --> 04:16:29.939 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the institution
 
04:16:31.870 --> 04:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
to update
 
04:16:36.110 --> 04:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
its numbers with its current prices of
 
04:16:39.710 --> 04:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
course especially if they go up
 
04:16:39.720 --> 04:16:41.030 align:start position:0%
course especially if they go up
yes

04:16:41.030 --> 04:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:16:44.210 --> 04:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
right the example you gave was with
 
04:16:47.630 --> 04:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
respect to competition and uh it's in
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the hospital
 
04:16:51.769 --> 04:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
presumably therefore to have it uh it's
 
04:16:54.189 --> 04:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
uh the lowest price possible
 
04:16:56.090 --> 04:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
conceivably because we're not dealing
 
04:16:57.650 --> 04:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
necessarily with current we were asking
 
04:16:59.090 --> 04:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
about current and accurate you could
 
04:17:00.530 --> 04:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
actually have a price on there it would
 
04:17:01.849 --> 04:17:01.859 align:start position:0%
make a whole lot of sense but it could
 
04:17:04.610 --> 04:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
be artificially low in which case they
 
04:17:06.349 --> 04:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
would be held to that price
 
04:17:08.090 --> 04:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
right what they post is what they should
 
04:17:10.130 --> 04:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
charge that's how you comply should or
 
04:17:10.140 --> 04:17:11.150 align:start position:0%
charge that's how you comply should or
must

04:17:11.150 --> 04:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
must
 
04:17:14.689 --> 04:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
complying is a must thank you okay
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
you all set
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all right uh now
 
04:17:19.439 --> 04:17:33.229 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all right uh now
Josh

04:17:33.229 --> 04:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.210 --> 04:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman for the record my
 
04:17:38.809 --> 04:17:38.819 align:start position:0%
name is representative yokella
 
04:17:41.210 --> 04:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
um from Rockingham 32 Fremont Danville
 
04:17:43.610 --> 04:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
and Brentwood
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
um so the
 
04:17:49.610 --> 04:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
the main thing in this uh
 
04:17:54.950 --> 04:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is to ensure that if they were
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
if you get a quote
 
04:18:00.650 --> 04:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
um for you know uh if if you go online
 
04:18:03.110 --> 04:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
and you see that the Bills should be 500
 
04:18:05.450 --> 04:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
and they try and charge you twelve
 
04:18:07.370 --> 04:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars you should be able to
 
04:18:09.950 --> 04:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
go to court and say hey this is
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
this is not the amount that I was I
 
04:18:16.490 --> 04:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
agreed to because part of this
 
04:18:18.889 --> 04:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
um transparency is is just like if you
 
04:18:21.229 --> 04:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
go to the grocery store and they put the
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
price of five dollars on on the carton
 
04:18:25.729 --> 04:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
of milk if they go up to the if you go
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
up to the cash register saying they try
 
04:18:29.809 --> 04:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
and charge you 25 that is not
 
04:18:33.830 --> 04:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate right and so just like that
 
04:18:36.110 --> 04:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
that is no different than than this if
 
04:18:39.889 --> 04:18:39.899 align:start position:0%
they post the amount of 25 for your
 
04:18:42.290 --> 04:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
surgery then they should be held to that
 
04:18:44.450 --> 04:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
just like any other business in this
 
04:18:46.910 --> 04:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
state and so
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
um I think that I think that that is
 
04:18:52.189 --> 04:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
what they would be held to irrespective
 
04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
of this law I think if they post the the
 
04:18:54.479 --> 04:18:55.910 align:start position:0%
of this law I think if they post the the
amount

04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
amount
 
04:18:58.010 --> 04:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
that this is just getting them to post
 
04:19:00.710 --> 04:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
the amount right now a lot of times you
 
04:19:03.410 --> 04:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
go in and you don't necessarily know the
 
04:19:06.830 --> 04:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
amount and my understanding is that the
 
04:19:11.210 --> 04:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
um the amounts on the the uh
 
04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
the insurance website is estimates they
 
04:19:15.290 --> 04:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
are not
 
04:19:19.250 --> 04:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
um binding to those providers is my my
 
04:19:19.260 --> 04:19:20.929 align:start position:0%
um binding to those providers is my my
understanding

04:19:20.929 --> 04:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:19:23.510 --> 04:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
but um that is
 
04:19:26.870 --> 04:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
so this would actually be binding
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
um is my understanding of the current
 
04:19:31.070 --> 04:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
law and so
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
um also
 
04:19:35.689 --> 04:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
it it uh
 
04:19:37.309 --> 04:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
04:19:39.410 --> 04:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
it's possible that some of the the
 
04:19:42.050 --> 04:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
things that are currently posted this
 
04:19:44.450 --> 04:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
may be uh what the federal government
 
04:19:47.150 --> 04:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
are requiring may be a broader
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
um amount of of things to be posted
 
04:19:50.760 --> 04:19:52.490 align:start position:0%
um amount of of things to be posted
and

04:19:52.490 --> 04:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:54.410 --> 04:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
04:19:56.689 --> 04:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
we we pass around this amendment that
 
04:19:59.330 --> 04:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
that gives the option for for if the
 
04:20:02.710 --> 04:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
committee so chooses to to empower the
 
04:20:06.110 --> 04:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
DHHS when a person complains instead of
 
04:20:09.050 --> 04:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
as the representative suggested instead
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
of just not paying the bill and waiting
 
04:20:12.650 --> 04:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
to go to court that they could
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
preemptively go to DHHS and file a
 
04:20:18.050 --> 04:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
complaint and say this place is not in
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
compliance and then DHHS would make a
 
04:20:21.950 --> 04:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
determination and so that you wouldn't
 
04:20:23.330 --> 04:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
have to wait to go through that court
 
04:20:26.150 --> 04:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
process and it and so we're kind of
 
04:20:26.160 --> 04:20:27.469 align:start position:0%
process and it and so we're kind of
giving

04:20:27.469 --> 04:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
giving
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh the committee the option to go with
 
04:20:32.450 --> 04:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
either situation the situation where you
 
04:20:34.010 --> 04:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
go to court
 
04:20:34.020 --> 04:20:34.670 align:start position:0%
go to court
um

04:20:34.670 --> 04:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
and uh you use this as a defense that
 
04:20:39.710 --> 04:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
they were not in compliance and you
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
should not be held to to pay for a bill
 
04:20:43.490 --> 04:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
that you didn't know how much it was

04:20:46.439 --> 04:20:47.269 align:start position:0%
rendered
um

04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
that is one way to address the issue and
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that in
 
04:20:54.050 --> 04:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
Colorado that
 
04:20:57.950 --> 04:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
um sends the the the bill is passed the
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
sentiment is that when people reference
 
04:21:02.450 --> 04:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
the law and say that they're not going
 
04:21:05.450 --> 04:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
to pay it because because it's against
 
04:21:09.830 --> 04:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
the law then the the uh the facilities
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
will actually just
 
04:21:15.530 --> 04:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
um just not try and collect because they
 
04:21:17.570 --> 04:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
know that they will lose in court and so
 
04:21:21.110 --> 04:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
that is that is um
 
04:21:22.510 --> 04:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
um my
 
04:21:25.370 --> 04:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
knowledge about what the the sentiment
 
04:21:27.710 --> 04:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
is since the then since the law passed
 
04:21:27.720 --> 04:21:29.630 align:start position:0%
is since the then since the law passed
also

04:21:29.630 --> 04:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:21:32.450 --> 04:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to
 
04:21:35.330 --> 04:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
um just give my personal experience as
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
far as as being someone that had to go
 
04:21:44.990 --> 04:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
to uh the emergency room and wanted to
 
04:21:46.969 --> 04:21:46.979 align:start position:0%
to kind of make informative choices
 
04:21:50.090 --> 04:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
about what the bill like what I was
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
accepting and what I was not accepting
 
04:21:54.910 --> 04:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
um and and under the current
 
04:21:57.290 --> 04:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
transparency or price
 
04:21:57.300 --> 04:21:58.269 align:start position:0%
transparency or price
um

04:21:58.269 --> 04:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:58.279 --> 04:21:59.830 align:start position:0%
um
uh

04:21:59.830 --> 04:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:22:02.210 --> 04:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
structure that we have now you can
 
04:22:04.429 --> 04:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
request the information from the
 
04:22:06.590 --> 04:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals but it takes multiple days and
 
04:22:08.750 --> 04:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
multiple phone calls to actually get
 
04:22:11.090 --> 04:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
what the price will be
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
um like a hard quote for your procedure
 
04:22:16.670 --> 04:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
and I was not able to do that when I was
 
04:22:19.010 --> 04:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
in the emergency room but later for a
 
04:22:22.130 --> 04:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
recommended outpatient procedure I did
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
make multiple calls to multiple
 
04:22:24.960 --> 04:22:25.670 align:start position:0%
make multiple calls to multiple
um

04:22:25.670 --> 04:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:28.330 --> 04:22:28.340 align:start position:0%
facilities and and
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
providers to get those numbers and it
 
04:22:35.030 --> 04:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
took probably a week to get competitive
 
04:22:37.429 --> 04:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
bids whereas once this is transparent
 
04:22:40.510 --> 04:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
there's already people that are um
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
bringing these machine readable formats
 
04:22:45.410 --> 04:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
into an app that you can then just pull
 
04:22:47.269 --> 04:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
up on your phone very quickly and be
 
04:22:50.389 --> 04:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
able to compare and so the
 
04:22:53.210 --> 04:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
um I think that from a consumer uh
 
04:22:55.250 --> 04:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
standpoint you're going to be able to
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
essentially compare Real Time with being
 
04:23:01.070 --> 04:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
able or having to do it now with
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
multiple days of calling and tracking
 
04:23:05.689 --> 04:23:05.699 align:start position:0%
down to get an exact quote so thank you
 
04:23:07.130 --> 04:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
for for
 
04:23:09.050 --> 04:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm here here to answer
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
questions Representative Vincent
 
04:23:13.070 --> 04:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:23:16.210 --> 04:23:16.220 align:start position:0%
uh what you're referring to in your
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
example was called bait switch in the
 
04:23:20.750 --> 04:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
retail business which is illegal but and
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not assuming that
 
04:23:25.610 --> 04:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
um that or saying that the hospitals are
 
04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
doing this however my question is
 
04:23:28.439 --> 04:23:29.150 align:start position:0%
doing this however my question is
um

04:23:29.150 --> 04:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
do you know if the hospitals actually
 
04:23:33.849 --> 04:23:33.859 align:start position:0%
put when they put those prices on there
 
04:23:36.769 --> 04:23:36.779 align:start position:0%
revise at a certain date sometimes
 
04:23:38.590 --> 04:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
they'll put like a thing that says
 
04:23:40.969 --> 04:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
revised on this date
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
meaning and I'm not saying they haven't
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
they still need to comply with federal
 
04:23:47.150 --> 04:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
law right but do you know if they do
 
04:23:49.849 --> 04:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
that to let the consumer know that hey
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh we revised this two days ago and it
 
04:23:54.950 --> 04:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
could change
 
04:23:56.689 --> 04:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:23:59.330 --> 04:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to refrain from answering
 
04:24:02.269 --> 04:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
because I don't know the exact thank you
 
04:24:05.269 --> 04:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
um like the price as of this date and
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
then prices of this date kind of a thing
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not 100 sure so
 
04:24:13.309 --> 04:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
I will hopefully there's an expert with
 
04:24:15.650 --> 04:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
more more uh knowledge that we'll be
 
04:24:17.269 --> 04:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
able to answer that question thank you
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Terry has a
 
04:24:21.710 --> 04:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
question so are you aware of what the
 
04:24:24.050 --> 04:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
penalties are at the federal level for
 
04:24:25.610 --> 04:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
not complying with the federal
 
04:24:25.620 --> 04:24:27.769 align:start position:0%
not complying with the federal
regulations

04:24:27.769 --> 04:24:27.779 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
04:24:30.050 --> 04:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:24:35.450 --> 04:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:37.490 --> 04:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
um there's obviously there's going to be
 
04:24:39.110 --> 04:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
someone here that testifies that knows
 
04:24:41.510 --> 04:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
more intimately than me but my
 
04:24:44.650 --> 04:24:44.660 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the penalties were
 
04:24:47.929 --> 04:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
recently raised to around two million
 
04:24:51.410 --> 04:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
dollars but the um
 
04:24:53.530 --> 04:24:53.540 align:start position:0%
uh the department
 
04:24:56.269 --> 04:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
decided to not really enforce
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
any of that this is a
 
04:24:58.920 --> 04:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
any of that this is a
um

04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:02.990 --> 04:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
this kind of law stemmed from
 
04:25:03.000 --> 04:25:03.769 align:start position:0%
this kind of law stemmed from
um

04:25:03.769 --> 04:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:06.910 --> 04:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
a previous president's executive order
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
and the current president's
 
04:25:10.199 --> 04:25:10.849 align:start position:0%
and the current president's
um

04:25:10.849 --> 04:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
did not rescind it but is not
 
04:25:15.170 --> 04:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
necessarily enforcing
 
04:25:17.689 --> 04:25:17.699 align:start position:0%
um it is in Thoroughly as we would like
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
to see so this is an another way of
 
04:25:22.189 --> 04:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
enforcing that
 
04:25:22.199 --> 04:25:23.750 align:start position:0%
enforcing that
thinking

04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you
 
04:25:26.399 --> 04:25:28.309 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you
um

04:25:28.309 --> 04:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:31.370 --> 04:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the postings required
 
04:25:33.469 --> 04:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
under federal law are provided in New
 
04:25:35.689 --> 04:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on the insurance department
 
04:25:35.699 --> 04:25:37.969 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on the insurance department
website

04:25:37.969 --> 04:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
website
 
04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
um do you know and and I'm going to ask
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
a question and then just give you a one
 
04:25:46.010 --> 04:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
sentence explanation of why I'm asking
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
um do you know if there are any
 
04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
limitations on the types of procedures
 
04:25:50.880 --> 04:25:52.790 align:start position:0%
limitations on the types of procedures
uh

04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:55.010 --> 04:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
for which the costs are required to be
 
04:25:57.410 --> 04:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
posted on the insurance website and the
 
04:26:00.110 --> 04:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
reason that I ask is that never having
 
04:26:03.769 --> 04:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
heard about this uh provision of the New
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department uh
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
previous to it being discussed here
 
04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
um I used my iPad to check on it and
 
04:26:16.070 --> 04:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
found no listings for inpatient
 
04:26:19.610 --> 04:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
surgeries so are there some types do you
 
04:26:21.290 --> 04:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
know whether there are some types of
 
04:26:23.750 --> 04:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
procedures that must be posted where the
 
04:26:25.849 --> 04:26:25.859 align:start position:0%
cost must be posted and others where
 
04:26:29.149 --> 04:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
they're not required to post them
 
04:26:32.149 --> 04:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I am not
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with the list of things that
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
need to be posted in which things are
 
04:26:38.149 --> 04:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
not not required to be posted so I
 
04:26:39.410 --> 04:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to answer that question
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:46.250 --> 04:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you very much

representing all our hospitals we are
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill 389 there's a lot
 
04:27:47.809 --> 04:27:47.819 align:start position:0%
to unpack here and I will try to answer
 
04:27:50.450 --> 04:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have
 
04:27:54.110 --> 04:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
um but I'm going to actually jump to the
 
04:27:55.729 --> 04:27:55.739 align:start position:0%
attachment and so that's why I really
 
04:27:57.950 --> 04:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
want to make sure everyone has a copy of
 
04:28:02.710 --> 04:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:07.010 --> 04:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
the sponsors referenced that advocacy
 
04:28:10.010 --> 04:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
Group Patient rights Advocate and I
 
04:28:12.290 --> 04:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
think it's just really important that we
 
04:28:15.769 --> 04:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
talk about that first because the no
 
04:28:18.889 --> 04:28:18.899 align:start position:0%
surprises Act was passed in January 21
 
04:28:22.670 --> 04:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
January 1 2021 it does require that the
 
04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
hospitals follow the the law which I
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
will emphatically state New Hampshire
 
04:28:31.250 --> 04:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
hospitals do in fact the
 
04:28:33.710 --> 04:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
um the the government does audit the
 
04:28:36.050 --> 04:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
hospitals in nationally there are two
 
04:28:38.689 --> 04:28:38.699 align:start position:0%
hospitals I repeat two hospitals
 
04:28:40.610 --> 04:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
nationally there are over four thousand
 
04:28:43.309 --> 04:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the country two two were
 
04:28:46.610 --> 04:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
found out of compliance not any in New
 
04:28:48.469 --> 04:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I just want to make that
 
04:28:50.450 --> 04:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
emphatic statement
 
04:28:53.689 --> 04:28:53.699 align:start position:0%
um in and back in last summer you will
 
04:28:56.809 --> 04:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
see there's a letter that is attached to
 
04:29:00.110 --> 04:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
attorney general formula from Steve on
 
04:29:02.389 --> 04:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
and the president of the association
 
04:29:05.929 --> 04:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
um and this I will not read it for you
 
04:29:08.809 --> 04:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
but it does um New Hampshire hospitals
 
04:29:12.170 --> 04:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
and attorney general from Ella as well
 
04:29:13.969 --> 04:29:13.979 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner of insurance and I
 
04:29:16.490 --> 04:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
don't know who else but um we're copied
 
04:29:19.010 --> 04:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
on these emails from this patient rights
 
04:29:22.510 --> 04:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
Advocate Group making misleading and um
 
04:29:25.189 --> 04:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
inappropriate statements relative to the
 
04:29:27.530 --> 04:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
compliance of New Hampshire hospitals we
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
take this very seriously we looked into
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
this and we wanted to clarify working
 
04:29:37.849 --> 04:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
with our partners at the AHA American
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association as well as HHS and
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
again two hospitals throughout the
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
entire country they are not New
 
04:29:46.849 --> 04:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospitals I want to reassure
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
you are not out of compliance
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
um in fact most the vast majority of our
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals around the country are not
 
04:29:55.070 --> 04:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
they are following the law it was put in
 
04:29:57.950 --> 04:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
place in January of 21 so keep that in
 
04:30:00.649 --> 04:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
mind too there are many Provisions that
 
04:30:04.429 --> 04:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
are implemented um and it is actually
 
04:30:06.590 --> 04:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
um it was passed um Senator Hassan was
 
04:30:09.349 --> 04:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh our Senator was very instrumental in
 
04:30:11.570 --> 04:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
getting this law passed so
 
04:30:13.010 --> 04:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I was I'm a little confused about
 
04:30:15.110 --> 04:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
that statement um about a prior
 
04:30:15.120 --> 04:30:16.309 align:start position:0%
that statement um about a prior
Administration

04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
04:30:18.649 --> 04:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
um the current Administration is in is
 
04:30:21.530 --> 04:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
following this um requirement in fact
 
04:30:23.809 --> 04:30:23.819 align:start position:0%
the second chart
 
04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
um shows the hospital transparency rules
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
that were the criteria used by this
 
04:30:33.050 --> 04:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
Advocate Group versus the CMS
 
04:30:36.290 --> 04:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
requirements and it is pretty clear that
 
04:30:39.290 --> 04:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
the criteria do not match what the CMS
 
04:30:42.469 --> 04:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
requirements are so any report that is
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
done by the by a group that is not using
 
04:30:47.570 --> 04:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
the same criteria will result in a
 
04:30:50.809 --> 04:30:50.819 align:start position:0%
different outcome and that that is just
 
04:30:55.210 --> 04:30:55.220 align:start position:0%
a fact so I just wanted to clarify that
 
04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
and again we are opposed to this for
 
04:31:01.309 --> 04:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
many reasons we do take this very
 
04:31:03.110 --> 04:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
seriously and our hospitals are in
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
compliance to have something at a state
 
04:31:07.670 --> 04:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
level and I understand this advocacy
 
04:31:10.010 --> 04:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
group is my understanding there is um
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
there is kind of model legislation being
 
04:31:14.090 --> 04:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
shopped around the country
 
04:31:15.290 --> 04:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
um that is not what New Hampshire
 
04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
typically does New Hampshire wants um to
 
04:31:20.389 --> 04:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
do what New Hampshire needs to do for
 
04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
their for their residents
 
04:31:25.849 --> 04:31:25.859 align:start position:0%
um the the federal law is com is complex
 
04:31:29.050 --> 04:31:29.060 align:start position:0%
they do have a requirement to have
 
04:31:32.510 --> 04:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
machine readable charges on their
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
website and again the hospitals do this
 
04:31:37.729 --> 04:31:37.739 align:start position:0%
we routinely double check with them they
 
04:31:39.649 --> 04:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
are they have compliance officers they
 
04:31:42.410 --> 04:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
have revenue cycle folks they have
 
04:31:46.309 --> 04:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
um Chief Financial officers CEOs the
 
04:31:48.290 --> 04:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
board they take this very seriously I
 
04:31:51.110 --> 04:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
just want to reassure you to add more
 
04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
complexity to this by adding references
 
04:31:57.950 --> 04:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
to let me find that bill because it's I
 
04:32:00.050 --> 04:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
find it I found it very confusing and I
 
04:32:01.610 --> 04:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
a number of you have already picked up
 
04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
on this what material compliance
 
04:32:05.050 --> 04:32:05.060 align:start position:0%
according to who
 
04:32:09.229 --> 04:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
and what what what is the this for a
 
04:32:11.929 --> 04:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
balanced bill would go to court that
 
04:32:15.229 --> 04:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
just um that just seems um really adding
 
04:32:17.389 --> 04:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of complexity to an already very
 
04:32:19.729 --> 04:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
complex system as you all know
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
um because of anyone that um because you
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
follow insurance law and Health Care is
 
04:32:27.649 --> 04:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
very complicated
 
04:32:29.710 --> 04:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
um so we are concerned about having
 
04:32:32.330 --> 04:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies with a federal law and a
 
04:32:35.929 --> 04:32:35.939 align:start position:0%
state law and the penalty is significant
 
04:32:37.849 --> 04:32:37.859 align:start position:0%
again I you just heard what the federal
 
04:32:40.849 --> 04:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
penalty is that's pretty staggering um
 
04:32:44.510 --> 04:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
and then to have HHS then has our DHHS
 
04:32:47.330 --> 04:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
would then have to promulgate rules to
 
04:32:50.929 --> 04:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
have additional penalties seems really
 
04:32:54.649 --> 04:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
excessive and not appropriate again our
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
hospitals are complying with the with
 
04:32:59.990 --> 04:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
the law and I I do I agree with the
 
04:33:00.000 --> 04:33:00.710 align:start position:0%
the law and I I do I agree with the
chair

04:33:00.710 --> 04:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
um our health cost website that the
 
04:33:05.631 --> 04:33:05.641 align:start position:0%
department of insurance I think are here
 
04:33:07.609 --> 04:33:07.619 align:start position:0%
and they can they can talk about this
 
04:33:11.051 --> 04:33:11.061 align:start position:0%
very um good it's called
 
04:33:13.970 --> 04:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
healthcost.org I believe it is a very
 
04:33:16.250 --> 04:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
good website it has been in development
 
04:33:18.769 --> 04:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
it is considered a model for other
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
states they've tried to come they've
 
04:33:22.810 --> 04:33:22.820 align:start position:0%
tried to actually
 
04:33:25.551 --> 04:33:25.561 align:start position:0%
do exactly what New Hampshire did to
 
04:33:28.131 --> 04:33:28.141 align:start position:0%
some some different degrees of Success
 
04:33:29.869 --> 04:33:29.879 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is very proud of their
 
04:33:31.369 --> 04:33:31.379 align:start position:0%
health cost website it does not have
 
04:33:33.410 --> 04:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
everything there are reasons why it does
 
04:33:35.689 --> 04:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
not have everything privacy is really
 
04:33:37.490 --> 04:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
important and the department can
 
04:33:39.890 --> 04:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
certainly address that but between the
 
04:33:41.570 --> 04:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
insurers that they have a lot of
 
04:33:43.910 --> 04:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
information on their websites hospitals
 
04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
have a lot of information on their
 
04:33:47.470 --> 04:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
websites and the department of insurance
 
04:33:49.789 --> 04:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
we believe that there are many
 
04:33:52.970 --> 04:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
opportunities to to seek this
 
04:33:55.010 --> 04:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
information I also wanted to clarify
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
getting a quote from a hospital has been
 
04:33:58.970 --> 04:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
something that you can you have been
 
04:34:01.369 --> 04:34:01.379 align:start position:0%
able to do it is not easy you certainly
 
04:34:02.810 --> 04:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
can't do it in the middle of an
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
emergency room but hospitals have done
 
04:34:08.090 --> 04:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
that that is different than posting your
 
04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
charges getting a quote for a total knee
 
04:34:13.010 --> 04:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
replacement is not going to be something
 
04:34:16.250 --> 04:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
that you can look up on a website I'm
 
04:34:18.109 --> 04:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
04:34:20.470 --> 04:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
04:34:25.010 --> 04:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:30.650 --> 04:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:33.590 --> 04:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
Insurance surgery or whatever
 
04:34:36.230 --> 04:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
I believe they're in the insurers are
 
04:34:38.570 --> 04:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
here and they can answer that I know
 
04:34:41.570 --> 04:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
um my insurance company I can do that um
 
04:34:44.269 --> 04:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
because what is you because they the
 
04:34:46.369 --> 04:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
insurer knows what your did if you've
 
04:34:48.709 --> 04:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
met your deductible or not um and how
 
04:34:50.449 --> 04:34:50.459 align:start position:0%
much um if you've met you're out of
 
04:34:53.390 --> 04:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
pocket Etc so I I know that many
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
insurers do have really robust tools
 
04:34:59.810 --> 04:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
um to but as far as being able to I
 
04:35:01.490 --> 04:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
believe that they can
 
04:35:03.650 --> 04:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
um I usually use it to just see what my
 
04:35:06.170 --> 04:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
deductible out of pocket is that kind of
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
thing yeah but the problem was that the
 
04:35:10.490 --> 04:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
the insurance company will can know what
 
04:35:13.189 --> 04:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
the hospital cost is but they might not
 
04:35:15.490 --> 04:35:15.500 align:start position:0%
know what the physician or the
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist exactly which are the
 
04:35:19.490 --> 04:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
other two and that was the benefit of
 
04:35:21.109 --> 04:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
the state plan was to try to merge all
 
04:35:22.609 --> 04:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
those right together you're right you're
 
04:35:24.949 --> 04:35:24.959 align:start position:0%
right okay representative Gibbs thank
 
04:35:24.959 --> 04:35:25.789 align:start position:0%
right okay representative Gibbs thank
you

04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask you the same
 
04:35:29.929 --> 04:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
question that I asked the uh previous
 
04:35:33.051 --> 04:35:33.061 align:start position:0%
person who testified and that is do you
 
04:35:35.029 --> 04:35:35.039 align:start position:0%
know if there are any limitations as to
 
04:35:38.090 --> 04:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
what hospitals are required to post on
 
04:35:40.910 --> 04:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Insurance department's
 
04:35:43.131 --> 04:35:43.141 align:start position:0%
website and again the reason that I ask
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
is because I decided to check it to see
 
04:35:49.070 --> 04:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
how it worked and I could find no
 
04:35:52.730 --> 04:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
um category at all for inpatient uh
 
04:35:55.849 --> 04:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
surgery there was a reason why we don't
 
04:35:57.590 --> 04:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
provide that information the hospitals
 
04:35:59.150 --> 04:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
don't provide that information and again
 
04:36:00.890 --> 04:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
there are experts here from the
 
04:36:03.109 --> 04:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
Department that can explain there are
 
04:36:04.910 --> 04:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
criteria how they I think there's
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
actually information on their website
 
04:36:08.029 --> 04:36:08.039 align:start position:0%
that explains where they get that
 
04:36:09.650 --> 04:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
information it's the Comprehensive
 
04:36:11.869 --> 04:36:11.879 align:start position:0%
Health Information
 
04:36:11.879 --> 04:36:13.510 align:start position:0%
Health Information
um

04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:16.131 --> 04:36:16.141 align:start position:0%
yeah we don't provide the hospitals
 
04:36:18.109 --> 04:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
don't provide so what I've done is just
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
now is ask the insurance department and
 
04:36:21.529 --> 04:36:21.539 align:start position:0%
when we take up this bill and
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that they will be prepared
 
04:36:26.510 --> 04:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
to make a presentation so bring your
 
04:36:30.051 --> 04:36:30.061 align:start position:0%
iPad on February 1st and they can walk
 
04:36:32.150 --> 04:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
us through it so we positively will
 
04:36:35.449 --> 04:36:35.459 align:start position:0%
thank you and also um if you have a few
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
minutes afterward
 
04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh we should just talk about this
 
04:36:40.670 --> 04:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
just for a moment I'd appreciate it no
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
problem okay
 
04:36:44.330 --> 04:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative Sullivan
 
04:36:46.010 --> 04:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:36:48.170 --> 04:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
um so it seems to me as I read the bill
 
04:36:51.170 --> 04:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
that the Bill's intention is to just
 
04:36:52.970 --> 04:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
make sure that hospitals are in
 
04:36:56.209 --> 04:36:56.219 align:start position:0%
compliance so if you're all in compliant
 
04:36:58.010 --> 04:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
what is the concern about this bill I
 
04:36:59.150 --> 04:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
mean you cite a lot of things like
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
conflicting standards but it seems to me
 
04:37:03.109 --> 04:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
that the standard is to be in compliant
 
04:37:04.910 --> 04:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
with the federal law you guys are all in
 
04:37:07.131 --> 04:37:07.141 align:start position:0%
compliance so if that's true hey you
 
04:37:09.289 --> 04:37:09.299 align:start position:0%
have nothing to worry about in B it only
 
04:37:10.490 --> 04:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem if somebody becomes
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
not compliant with the federal standard
 
04:37:14.570 --> 04:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to figure out why you
 
04:37:16.670 --> 04:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
have such strong opposition to it
 
04:37:19.970 --> 04:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
because a couple reasons why one is
 
04:37:21.949 --> 04:37:21.959 align:start position:0%
there is a federal law that addresses
 
04:37:26.209 --> 04:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
this to um the um the new language has
 
04:37:29.449 --> 04:37:29.459 align:start position:0%
to do with collection action and this
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
idea of medical of material compliance
 
04:37:34.849 --> 04:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
when you and there are hospitals
 
04:37:38.810 --> 04:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
um that um that would find if you have a
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
state a state law that is not consistent
 
04:37:42.590 --> 04:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
with a federal law that is very
 
04:37:45.170 --> 04:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
confusing to them um so that would like
 
04:37:48.890 --> 04:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
which one applies and um and so that is
 
04:37:51.170 --> 04:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
our concern that they follow the federal
 
04:37:55.010 --> 04:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
law um and the and the HHS at the
 
04:37:56.689 --> 04:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
federal level is responsible for
 
04:37:59.390 --> 04:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
auditing so that is our concern that
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
this is redundant and not necessary in
 
04:38:04.510 --> 04:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
our opinion
 
04:38:08.570 --> 04:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:08.580 --> 04:38:10.189 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:38:10.189 --> 04:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:38:11.810 --> 04:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
testimony sure I'm just looking at this
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
letter that you sent to the attorney
 
04:38:15.890 --> 04:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
general yep
 
04:38:18.410 --> 04:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
um June 16th last year
 
04:38:20.810 --> 04:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
um the last paragraph it says there's
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
352 notices by CMS that went out
 
04:38:26.029 --> 04:38:26.039 align:start position:0%
and then it says half of those are now
 
04:38:28.131 --> 04:38:28.141 align:start position:0%
in compliance while the other the other
 
04:38:30.170 --> 04:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
half assuming it means that the other
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
the others are working to be compliant
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
so that that's about 175.76
 
04:38:37.551 --> 04:38:37.561 align:start position:0%
hospitals that are working to be
 
04:38:39.650 --> 04:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
compliant and my question is are any of
 
04:38:41.570 --> 04:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
those in New Hampshire and it sounds
 
04:38:43.369 --> 04:38:43.379 align:start position:0%
like you're saying no no no no no no
 
04:38:45.949 --> 04:38:45.959 align:start position:0%
okay yeah this was information that we
 
04:38:47.869 --> 04:38:47.879 align:start position:0%
got at a national level
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you yep
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
any questions all set thank you thank
 
04:38:57.109 --> 04:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
you I got one card left Patrick Neville
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:07.310 --> 04:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:08.869 --> 04:39:08.879 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and committee
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me um I come from
 
04:39:13.369 --> 04:39:13.379 align:start position:0%
Colorado and actually passed a similar
 
04:39:16.609 --> 04:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
bill here or there on this topic and so
 
04:39:18.170 --> 04:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
we have a thing in Colorado called term
 
04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
and wits and I think it's so now I'm
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
officially in recovery stage of being a
 
04:39:23.869 --> 04:39:23.879 align:start position:0%
politician and this is part of my
 
04:39:25.310 --> 04:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
therapy to come and speak to you so
 
04:39:27.529 --> 04:39:27.539 align:start position:0%
thanks for the three three therapy
 
04:39:29.631 --> 04:39:29.641 align:start position:0%
but so I want to break this down into
 
04:39:32.209 --> 04:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
how this bill actually works and there's
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
some pieces in the amendment that
 
04:39:34.849 --> 04:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
Colorado doesn't have I wish they would
 
04:39:36.590 --> 04:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
add that's good but I like to break it
 
04:39:37.730 --> 04:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
down into basically two different
 
04:39:39.948 --> 04:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
buckets so you've got your state agency
 
04:39:41.810 --> 04:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
enforcement and then you have your
 
04:39:43.610 --> 04:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
consumer protection provisions and the
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
bill was originally drafted mostly with
 
04:39:47.630 --> 04:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
those consumer protection Provisions in
 
04:39:49.610 --> 04:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
mind and that's exactly what we did in
 
04:39:49.620 --> 04:39:50.510 align:start position:0%
mind and that's exactly what we did in
Colorado

04:39:50.510 --> 04:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
Colorado
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
so this bill is based entirely on the
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
federal rule so it's not creating a new
 
04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
separate standard of rules it's just
 
04:39:58.490 --> 04:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
making sure they comply by the federal
 
04:40:00.708 --> 04:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
rules and then rather than the federal
 
04:40:00.718 --> 04:40:02.150 align:start position:0%
rules and then rather than the federal
government

04:40:02.150 --> 04:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:40:04.368 --> 04:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
instituting it and enforcing it the
 
04:40:06.650 --> 04:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
state has the ability to do that as well
 
04:40:08.630 --> 04:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
and I think the state can probably react
 
04:40:09.530 --> 04:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
a lot quicker than the federal
 
04:40:11.570 --> 04:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
government and I know my circumstance
 
04:40:13.670 --> 04:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
even though I'm in a very blue State and
 
04:40:15.530 --> 04:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
I'm a very red person full disclosure
 
04:40:17.330 --> 04:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
and when I did run this bill by the way
 
04:40:19.010 --> 04:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
I ran it with someone on the other side
 
04:40:21.050 --> 04:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
of the aisle who we probably never
 
04:40:23.208 --> 04:40:23.218 align:start position:0%
agreed on in eight years of serving
 
04:40:25.368 --> 04:40:25.378 align:start position:0%
together and we got it done 99 to one so
 
04:40:27.770 --> 04:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's a very bipartisan issue but it
 
04:40:29.630 --> 04:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
allows the state agency to actually
 
04:40:31.070 --> 04:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
enforce it but the beauty about the
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
consumer protection piece is is if a
 
04:40:35.390 --> 04:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
consumer is actually affected and the
 
04:40:37.610 --> 04:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
hospital does not comply by this it
 
04:40:40.010 --> 04:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't help that individual consumer
 
04:40:43.010 --> 04:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
to have the government issue a fine
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
and so what's happening in Colorado this
 
04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
bill went into effect August 10th and
 
04:40:48.530 --> 04:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
what's happening is I'll give you an
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
example there was a patient out there
 
04:40:52.250 --> 04:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
who got a quote
 
04:40:54.530 --> 04:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
was given a price by the hospital 1300
 
04:40:55.970 --> 04:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
out of pocket
 
04:40:58.368 --> 04:40:58.378 align:start position:0%
for a hysterectomy retired school
 
04:40:58.378 --> 04:41:00.830 align:start position:0%
for a hysterectomy retired school
teacher

04:41:00.830 --> 04:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
two weeks after the after the surgery
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
they say no the insurance declined it
 
04:41:05.930 --> 04:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
here's your bill for eighty thousand
 
04:41:05.940 --> 04:41:06.890 align:start position:0%
here's your bill for eighty thousand
dollars

04:41:06.890 --> 04:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:41:08.510 --> 04:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
well the bill creates an affirmative
 
04:41:10.070 --> 04:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
defense so if the hospital tries to send
 
04:41:12.288 --> 04:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
her to collections or sue her in court
 
04:41:14.330 --> 04:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
she now has an affirmative defense
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
so this bill's been in effect since
 
04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
August 10th in Colorado we haven't seen
 
04:41:20.090 --> 04:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
one lawsuit because what's happening is
 
04:41:21.410 --> 04:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
they turn around and say we have this
 
04:41:21.420 --> 04:41:22.368 align:start position:0%
they turn around and say we have this
law

04:41:22.368 --> 04:41:22.378 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:41:23.690 --> 04:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
we're going to use it and then the
 
04:41:25.730 --> 04:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
hospital says okay we agree
 
04:41:29.390 --> 04:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
pay the 1300 and we'll call it even
 
04:41:32.448 --> 04:41:32.458 align:start position:0%
and so I think what's happening in the
 
04:41:32.458 --> 04:41:34.010 align:start position:0%
and so I think what's happening in the
um

04:41:34.010 --> 04:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:35.690 --> 04:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
I did a little bit of research on the
 
04:41:37.070 --> 04:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:41:39.190 --> 04:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire's
 
04:41:41.570 --> 04:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
database is based on the all play all
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
claims payer data which is past
 
04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
historical data that can be accurate so
 
04:41:49.550 --> 04:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman in your case it might have
 
04:41:51.170 --> 04:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
been very accurate but it's not always
 
04:41:53.448 --> 04:41:53.458 align:start position:0%
accurate so this bill would ensure that
 
04:41:55.850 --> 04:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
the prices that are posted must be
 
04:41:57.650 --> 04:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
accurate and if they're not
 
04:41:59.930 --> 04:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
the state agency then can enforce it and
 
04:42:01.128 --> 04:42:01.138 align:start position:0%
then the consumer if they're actually
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
violated by this they have an
 
04:42:04.970 --> 04:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism as well
 
04:42:06.830 --> 04:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
and I think what's really exciting about
 
04:42:08.208 --> 04:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
this in Colorado
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
is now we have Tech developers that are
 
04:42:10.910 --> 04:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
coming together and putting together
 
04:42:13.490 --> 04:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
some really usable platforms for
 
04:42:14.930 --> 04:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
consumers that can give all sorts of
 
04:42:16.250 --> 04:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
options so even if you have insurance
 
04:42:18.050 --> 04:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
coverage and it's a high deductible plan
 
04:42:21.050 --> 04:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
you can find other out of network cash
 
04:42:23.090 --> 04:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
prices for a much less can be sometimes
 
04:42:25.128 --> 04:42:25.138 align:start position:0%
up to 40 percent than the lowest
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
negotiated insurance Price so it helps
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
those people on those High deductible
 
04:42:30.890 --> 04:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
plans it's not necessarily Insurance
 
04:42:32.868 --> 04:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
related and it's starting to bring down
 
04:42:34.730 --> 04:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
the cost and these Tech developers are
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to the point where they're even
 
04:42:39.050 --> 04:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
starting to geo-fence hospitals so
 
04:42:39.060 --> 04:42:40.250 align:start position:0%
starting to geo-fence hospitals so
hospitals

04:42:40.250 --> 04:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
04:42:41.810 --> 04:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
you can come in and you'll get a text
 
04:42:42.890 --> 04:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
and it'll say if this is a true
 
04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
emergency don't let it slow you down but
 
04:42:46.070 --> 04:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
if you want to speak to someone right
 
04:42:46.080 --> 04:42:46.730 align:start position:0%
if you want to speak to someone right
now

04:42:46.730 --> 04:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
click this link it'll pop them into a
 
04:42:49.610 --> 04:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
link you can speak to a medical
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
professional right away and they can
 
04:42:52.190 --> 04:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
04:42:53.628 --> 04:42:53.638 align:start position:0%
okay it's going to be a three thousand
 
04:42:55.250 --> 04:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
dollar bill if you go into the hospital
 
04:42:57.708 --> 04:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
for this but you can go to an Urgent
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
Care 1.2 miles away and it's going to be
 
04:43:02.090 --> 04:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
a 600 bill
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
and so it's a very powerful tool for
 
04:43:06.230 --> 04:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
consumers and then now we're actually
 
04:43:08.090 --> 04:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
starting to see competition and that's
 
04:43:10.368 --> 04:43:10.378 align:start position:0%
truly what I love about this is once you
 
04:43:11.930 --> 04:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
actually get price competition into a
 
04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
market that's 20 of our national economy
 
04:43:16.850 --> 04:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
we're going to significantly lower
 
04:43:19.730 --> 04:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
prices and help consumers out
 
04:43:23.330 --> 04:43:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:25.910 --> 04:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
welcome to New Hampshire yes we could
 
04:43:28.490 --> 04:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
have used them yesterday so uh under New
 
04:43:30.170 --> 04:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law the Consumer Protection
 
04:43:32.150 --> 04:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
Law would be in effect hospitals are not
 
04:43:34.250 --> 04:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
exempt from consumer protection
 
04:43:37.610 --> 04:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
and yes if they quoted you a misquoted
 
04:43:37.620 --> 04:43:38.628 align:start position:0%
and yes if they quoted you a misquoted
price

04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
price
 
04:43:42.650 --> 04:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
you could absolutely go to court and in
 
04:43:44.090 --> 04:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law you can get your
 
04:43:45.770 --> 04:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
legal fees paid and you can even get
 
04:43:47.208 --> 04:43:47.218 align:start position:0%
Triple damages
 
04:43:49.610 --> 04:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
so that's current law
 
04:43:52.128 --> 04:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
do we need this bill
 
04:43:53.570 --> 04:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I would say that this
 
04:43:55.070 --> 04:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
evening strengthens it even more because
 
04:43:57.410 --> 04:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
it actually defines it Shores it up says
 
04:43:59.448 --> 04:43:59.458 align:start position:0%
exactly what's happening if in this
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
specific circumstance
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
and like I mentioned too in Colorado the
 
04:44:06.830 --> 04:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
beauty about this is with this law
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
we haven't even seen any lawsuits we're
 
04:44:10.010 --> 04:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
seeing hospitals first off coming into
 
04:44:11.448 --> 04:44:11.458 align:start position:0%
compliance more
 
04:44:13.490 --> 04:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
second off the consumers that are
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
actually violated the hospital says
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to honor that original deal
 
04:44:18.590 --> 04:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
that we quoted you on yeah I mean in New
 
04:44:19.610 --> 04:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you would just call up a
 
04:44:21.530 --> 04:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
lawyer and have the lawyer make the call
 
04:44:24.170 --> 04:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
and say we're going to exercise our
 
04:44:25.788 --> 04:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
rights on the consumer protection act
 
04:44:30.128 --> 04:44:30.138 align:start position:0%
you know you misquoted the price and
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
theoretically the hospital would refund
 
04:44:33.410 --> 04:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
the money
 
04:44:35.810 --> 04:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
no no well you're still using a lawyer
 
04:44:37.788 --> 04:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
even with this bill I mean your health
 
04:44:39.470 --> 04:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
and human services is you know they're
 
04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
going to have a hearing on the case so I
 
04:44:47.150 --> 04:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
I guess uh uh the question is is
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
my fear is this bill is all about not
 
04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
paying a bill
 
04:44:54.708 --> 04:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
that if that you're using it it's
 
04:44:56.090 --> 04:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
getting used and I think representative
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
Sullivan asked the question is it is
 
04:45:00.470 --> 04:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
that is it the real intent is that you
 
04:45:02.330 --> 04:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
just don't want to pay the bill
 
04:45:04.670 --> 04:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
and that you're using this federal
 
04:45:09.650 --> 04:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
statute as a as a say well look see you
 
04:45:11.390 --> 04:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
didn't do it right or you didn't quote
 
04:45:13.250 --> 04:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
right you didn't do that so I don't have
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
to pay the bill
 
04:45:17.810 --> 04:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
have you seen that happen in Colorado no
 
04:45:19.610 --> 04:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
and in fact Mr chairman it's been the
 
04:45:21.650 --> 04:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
exact opposite so the bill like I
 
04:45:23.208 --> 04:45:23.218 align:start position:0%
mentioned has been in effect since
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
August 10th and what we're more likely
 
04:45:28.250 --> 04:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
seeing is that when there's a bill
 
04:45:30.770 --> 04:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
discrepancy the exact opposite happens
 
04:45:32.208 --> 04:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
the hospital realizes they're going to
 
04:45:33.650 --> 04:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
lose in court if the patient takes it
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
any further they go back on their
 
04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
original their original deal or they go
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
back to the original deal honor the
 
04:45:41.690 --> 04:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
original deal and then the patient then
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
pays that original price they were given
 
04:45:45.590 --> 04:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
and it's a price I mean that's one of
 
04:45:46.910 --> 04:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
the things that I want to get into
 
04:45:49.070 --> 04:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's that we need to make more clear
 
04:45:51.110 --> 04:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
in the healthcare industry a price is
 
04:45:52.670 --> 04:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
not always a quote a quote's not always
 
04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
a price an estimate's not always a price
 
04:45:56.448 --> 04:45:56.458 align:start position:0%
and I think consumers want the price
 
04:45:58.910 --> 04:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be okay sounds great
 
04:46:02.090 --> 04:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
oh representative Harry thank you
 
04:46:05.448 --> 04:46:05.458 align:start position:0%
so I'm intrigued by your mention that
 
04:46:05.458 --> 04:46:07.010 align:start position:0%
so I'm intrigued by your mention that
someone

04:46:07.010 --> 04:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
someone
 
04:46:09.650 --> 04:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
could presumably it's an app go on their
 
04:46:09.660 --> 04:46:10.550 align:start position:0%
could presumably it's an app go on their
phone

04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
phone
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
and see that if they went into the
 
04:46:14.810 --> 04:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
emergency room for a procedure would be
 
04:46:16.128 --> 04:46:16.138 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars but if they went
 
04:46:17.810 --> 04:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
to the Urgent Care it was six hundred
 
04:46:17.820 --> 04:46:18.948 align:start position:0%
to the Urgent Care it was six hundred
dollars

04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:46:21.050 --> 04:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have any such tool
 
04:46:23.570 --> 04:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
available to us here in New Hampshire if
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
we do I would appreciate somebody
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
telling me before I leave today
 
04:46:31.010 --> 04:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
um but would you would you address the
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
question if you believe that the law
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
that you say went into effect in
 
04:46:39.050 --> 04:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
Colorado on August 10th was had anything
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
to do with this tool being made
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
available to the consumers to the
 
04:46:46.970 --> 04:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
residents in the state of Colorado is
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
there any kind of cause and effect
 
04:46:51.650 --> 04:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
relationship or is the tool that you're
 
04:46:53.990 --> 04:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you mentioned something
 
04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's just somewhat independent of the
 
04:46:59.770 --> 04:46:59.780 align:start position:0%
law that was passed
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative thanks for the
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
question I think they are connected
 
04:47:05.330 --> 04:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
because one of the things the tool is
 
04:47:06.410 --> 04:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
actually doing as well is they're
 
04:47:09.230 --> 04:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
cataloging cataloging that data from all
 
04:47:10.610 --> 04:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
the hospitals daily
 
04:47:12.350 --> 04:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
and then they actually can see whether
 
04:47:14.448 --> 04:47:14.458 align:start position:0%
or not the hospital is compliant on the
 
04:47:15.948 --> 04:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
date of the service what the hospital's
 
04:47:18.770 --> 04:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
price was posted on that day so then if
 
04:47:20.208 --> 04:47:20.218 align:start position:0%
the patient then gets a different bill
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
for a separate amount than what they
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually had logged on the date of
 
04:47:25.970 --> 04:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
service then they can help the patient
 
04:47:32.750 --> 04:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:35.690 --> 04:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
04:47:39.410 --> 04:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
so what was your fiscal note what
 
04:47:42.770 --> 04:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
did you have to have an agency take care
 
04:47:45.288 --> 04:47:45.298 align:start position:0%
of this on it
 
04:47:47.050 --> 04:47:47.060 align:start position:0%
certain level
 
04:47:49.550 --> 04:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately representative in
 
04:47:51.110 --> 04:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
Colorado we didn't do the state agency
 
04:47:52.850 --> 04:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement I think it's a yes and
 
04:47:55.310 --> 04:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
conversation here not an either or we
 
04:47:57.650 --> 04:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
just did the consumer protection so we
 
04:47:59.208 --> 04:47:59.218 align:start position:0%
did not have a fiscal note on that there
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
was no fiscal note now imagine there
 
04:48:02.628 --> 04:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
probably would be with the state agency
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement I don't know if that would
 
04:48:06.410 --> 04:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
be positive or negative as we've seen
 
04:48:08.270 --> 04:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
with the White House they've raised the
 
04:48:11.570 --> 04:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
the fines up to two million dollars
 
04:48:14.270 --> 04:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
however they have chosen not to they
 
04:48:15.948 --> 04:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
actually issue Discretions or issued
 
04:48:17.150 --> 04:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
orders out there saying we're not going
 
04:48:18.948 --> 04:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
to enforce this indefinitely so while
 
04:48:21.230 --> 04:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
they raise the fines they haven't as we
 
04:48:22.850 --> 04:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
heard there's only been two fines issued
 
04:48:24.410 --> 04:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
but there's we know there's more
 
04:48:26.150 --> 04:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals out of compliance than that
 
04:48:27.948 --> 04:48:27.958 align:start position:0%
and so it's hard to parse what the
 
04:48:30.170 --> 04:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
fiscal note would be but in Colorado in
 
04:48:33.050 --> 04:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
our circumstance we did not have one
 
04:48:35.150 --> 04:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
for the question main car
 
04:48:38.750 --> 04:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
yes so the other part of that is
 
04:48:38.760 --> 04:48:39.288 align:start position:0%
yes so the other part of that is
um

04:48:39.288 --> 04:48:39.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:42.288 --> 04:48:42.298 align:start position:0%
who are the people that are
 
04:48:45.530 --> 04:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
um doing these new systems where you
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
know is that something that is being
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
paid is the healthcare industry doing
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
that is it people doing it on their own
 
04:48:54.110 --> 04:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
are they different companies and who's
 
04:48:55.610 --> 04:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
paying for that
 
04:48:56.570 --> 04:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative it's private individuals
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
that actually see a business opportunity
 
04:49:02.510 --> 04:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
once the data is actually posted they
 
04:49:04.190 --> 04:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
can use utilize that data and what we're
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of too is it's not just
 
04:49:07.010 --> 04:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
individual patients that are using this
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
but employers are taking advantage of
 
04:49:11.090 --> 04:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
this in a big way because employers can
 
04:49:13.550 --> 04:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
start looking at what they're paying in
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
their true prices they're paying to the
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals and actually negotiate better
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
rates negotiate better rates with their
 
04:49:21.410 --> 04:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
insurance companies once they actually
 
04:49:23.570 --> 04:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
have that information and so oftentimes
 
04:49:25.310 --> 04:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
the tech developers are actually selling
 
04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
this to employers as well so employers
 
04:49:29.150 --> 04:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
can access it and actually see what
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
they're paying because problem is a lot
 
04:49:32.330 --> 04:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
of employers especially small employers
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
want to we'll want to ensure their
 
04:49:35.930 --> 04:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
employees but they don't actually know
 
04:49:38.208 --> 04:49:38.218 align:start position:0%
what the out-of-pocket cost is once they
 
04:49:40.190 --> 04:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
have all this data the tech developers
 
04:49:41.690 --> 04:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
can sparse that for them and actually
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
show them that yes you have insurance
 
04:49:46.190 --> 04:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
and you're you're you can move to a
 
04:49:48.110 --> 04:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
better insurance plan that's actually
 
04:49:50.330 --> 04:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
going to cover less out of pocket
 
04:49:52.550 --> 04:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
for your employee or if you've got an
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
employee that's got a very specific
 
04:49:55.850 --> 04:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
issue that maybe there's another
 
04:49:58.070 --> 04:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier that has lower cost
 
04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
for that the employer can then move it
 
04:50:01.368 --> 04:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
to there and it makes it much easier for
 
04:50:03.288 --> 04:50:03.298 align:start position:0%
them to do it and it's all being done by
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:08.830 --> 04:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
so they're also tracking the insurance
 
04:50:12.050 --> 04:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and insurance Price rather
 
04:50:13.730 --> 04:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
than the hospital because I assume this
 
04:50:16.010 --> 04:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
was just the rack price for the hospital
 
04:50:17.930 --> 04:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
you know they actually tracking the
 
04:50:19.730 --> 04:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
individual insurance
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for that bill a hospital I
 
04:50:23.990 --> 04:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
mean because most hospitals have no idea
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
what the dollar amounts are going to be
 
04:50:29.030 --> 04:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
they track so under the federal rule
 
04:50:30.170 --> 04:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
that's actually another thing that
 
04:50:31.490 --> 04:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's not really separate to this bill
 
04:50:32.930 --> 04:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
but under there's another Federal rule
 
04:50:35.330 --> 04:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
that requires the all claims payer data
 
04:50:37.610 --> 04:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
so they can actually pair that up and
 
04:50:40.010 --> 04:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
then the employers can actually see this
 
04:50:41.810 --> 04:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
is what the hospital's posted price was
 
04:50:44.288 --> 04:50:44.298 align:start position:0%
and this is what my insurance actually
 
04:50:47.448 --> 04:50:47.458 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and match those two up
 
04:50:49.910 --> 04:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
wow we like to see that
 
04:50:49.920 --> 04:50:52.368 align:start position:0%
wow we like to see that
okay

04:50:52.368 --> 04:50:52.378 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:50:54.288 --> 04:50:54.298 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr chair
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
and committee I have no more cards
 
04:51:03.410 --> 04:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:07.490 --> 04:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:10.910 --> 04:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:41.330 --> 04:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:44.208 --> 04:51:44.218 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open the hearing on House
 
04:51:51.650 --> 04:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:54.170 --> 04:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
who's got the wipes
 
04:51:56.690 --> 04:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
who took off with the uh the wipes they
 
04:52:00.250 --> 04:52:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
and uh just the time check we're an hour
 
04:52:04.490 --> 04:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
behind schedule so
 
04:52:06.288 --> 04:52:06.298 align:start position:0%
I will be
 
04:52:09.948 --> 04:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
very brief uh this is okay I forget the
 
04:52:14.330 --> 04:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
form so this is a legislation uh we will
 
04:52:17.330 --> 04:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
call it a housekeeping and it's uh
 
04:52:19.628 --> 04:52:19.638 align:start position:0%
submitted by the insurance department
 
04:52:23.030 --> 04:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
and so my name is on it because
 
04:52:25.610 --> 04:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
um I I think I was in the room where
 
04:52:27.288 --> 04:52:27.298 align:start position:0%
most of these things got passed in the
 
04:52:28.270 --> 04:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
first place
 
04:52:31.368 --> 04:52:31.378 align:start position:0%
but otherwise uh I will let the
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
department introduce uh and explain all
 
04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:45.410 --> 04:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
did you guys submit cards for the
 
04:52:47.520 --> 04:52:48.650 align:start position:0%
did you guys submit cards for the
testimony

04:52:48.650 --> 04:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:52:51.410 --> 04:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
yes okay they're here somewhere
 
04:52:53.090 --> 04:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
so if you just introduce yourself for
 
04:52:56.330 --> 04:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:58.250 --> 04:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Heather Silverstein
 
04:52:59.448 --> 04:52:59.458 align:start position:0%
I'm general counsel of the New Hampshire
 
04:53:00.830 --> 04:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
04:53:04.128 --> 04:53:04.138 align:start position:0%
and I'm Alex felvin examiner for the
 
04:53:08.090 --> 04:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:11.930 --> 04:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
um this bill HP 613 it is truly a
 
04:53:15.650 --> 04:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
cleanup bill it's a um uh it relates to
 
04:53:18.110 --> 04:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
RSA 404g which is with the individual
 
04:53:19.730 --> 04:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
health market
 
04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh this was originally acted that
 
04:53:23.868 --> 04:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
statute was really originally acted in
 
04:53:26.868 --> 04:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
1998 it created a non-profit then
 
04:53:29.390 --> 04:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire health plan with the purpose
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
of making
 
04:53:33.050 --> 04:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
um health insurance more available and
 
04:53:34.970 --> 04:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
also to establish a mandatory risk
 
04:53:36.350 --> 04:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
sharing plan with regard to the
 
04:53:39.050 --> 04:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
individual Market
 
04:53:41.810 --> 04:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
um we have been working with the New
 
04:53:44.208 --> 04:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire health plan to make these they
 
04:53:46.310 --> 04:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
helped us with this bill because what
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
happens is with any type of legislation
 
04:53:50.350 --> 04:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
you you put things in changes happen
 
04:53:53.810 --> 04:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
programs change and then several years
 
04:53:56.270 --> 04:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
down the road there's things in the
 
04:53:58.670 --> 04:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
statute that have become Obsolete and it
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
makes it confusing if you're just
 
04:54:03.470 --> 04:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
picking it up Anew I encountered that
 
04:54:05.810 --> 04:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
I've been at the department since 2015.
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
there was a couple of years ago when
 
04:54:10.550 --> 04:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
Alex was my supervisor as deputy and I
 
04:54:12.050 --> 04:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
was General Counsel and I was trying to
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
help him write an order and I didn't
 
04:54:15.650 --> 04:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
understand why there was a mention of
 
04:54:19.010 --> 04:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
all these other programs that no longer
 
04:54:21.550 --> 04:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
applied you know I I as an attorney
 
04:54:24.110 --> 04:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
particularly one I used to I started my
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
career working out for working for
 
04:54:27.708 --> 04:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
judges as a law clerk like I didn't
 
04:54:29.570 --> 04:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
understand why there was mention of
 
04:54:31.368 --> 04:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
these sorts of programs and should I be
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
somehow concerned with that and luckily
 
04:54:36.890 --> 04:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
Alex was is a great historian as to all
 
04:54:38.030 --> 04:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
of these programs that have been you
 
04:54:43.250 --> 04:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
used as to how to um help share risk
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
with this this particular Market So This
 
04:54:48.590 --> 04:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
truly is we went through we with the New
 
04:54:50.050 --> 04:54:50.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health Plan
 
04:54:53.890 --> 04:54:53.900 align:start position:0%
and helped change the definitions
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
and remove any terms that were no longer
 
04:54:58.310 --> 04:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
needed you know in the past a couple of
 
04:54:59.628 --> 04:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
programs you'll often see through the
 
04:55:02.448 --> 04:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
statute the high risk pool there was a
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
state high-risk pool there was a federal
 
04:55:07.610 --> 04:55:07.620 align:start position:0%
high-risk pool those are no longer
 
04:55:10.430 --> 04:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
applicable you may have heard of the
 
04:55:13.190 --> 04:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
1332 waiver program that is currently in
 
04:55:15.350 --> 04:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
play and that is something that the New
 
04:55:17.390 --> 04:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health Plan does administer
 
04:55:19.270 --> 04:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
for us so
 
04:55:23.150 --> 04:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
we have tried to do the best that we can
 
04:55:25.550 --> 04:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
to clean up the definitions get rid of
 
04:55:28.670 --> 04:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
what is not needed and just
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
make make it better you know
 
04:55:33.530 --> 04:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions
 
04:55:35.090 --> 04:55:35.100 align:start position:0%
um I may be able to help and Alex
 
04:55:36.590 --> 04:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
definitely like I said he's a great
 
04:55:38.448 --> 04:55:38.458 align:start position:0%
historian for all of the things that
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
happened in the past with regard to this
 
04:55:40.320 --> 04:55:44.570 align:start position:0%
happened in the past with regard to this
Market

04:55:44.570 --> 04:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:50.330 --> 04:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
I have a quick question okay
 
04:55:52.190 --> 04:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry I'm not that
 
04:55:54.590 --> 04:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with some of the terminology so
 
04:55:59.330 --> 04:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
the new New Hampshire health plan is
 
04:56:01.628 --> 04:56:01.638 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
04:56:04.430 --> 04:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
non-profit quasi-governmental entity
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is set up by Statute by this very
 
04:56:11.208 --> 04:56:11.218 align:start position:0%
statute and its operations are overseen
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
by the insurance commissioner through an
 
04:56:15.948 --> 04:56:15.958 align:start position:0%
approval process they develop a plan of
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
operation which the for executing the
 
04:56:20.990 --> 04:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
programs that they're statutorily
 
04:56:23.628 --> 04:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
responsible for implementing and the
 
04:56:25.670 --> 04:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner approves that plan of
 
04:56:25.680 --> 04:56:27.110 align:start position:0%
commissioner approves that plan of
operation

04:56:27.110 --> 04:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
operation
 
04:56:29.530 --> 04:56:29.540 align:start position:0%
so that's how it's existed that way
 
04:56:33.050 --> 04:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
since the initial creation quick
 
04:56:35.628 --> 04:56:35.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up so uh give me an example of
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
the pro
 
04:56:40.430 --> 04:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking that
 
04:56:43.190 --> 04:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
um just a little context
 
04:56:46.368 --> 04:56:46.378 align:start position:0%
um would help to explain it the
 
04:56:48.650 --> 04:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
individual health insurance Market is
 
04:56:51.770 --> 04:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
different from the group markets the
 
04:56:53.930 --> 04:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
small group and large group in an
 
04:56:55.368 --> 04:56:55.378 align:start position:0%
important way
 
04:56:58.128 --> 04:56:58.138 align:start position:0%
for group coverage you have this
 
04:56:59.690 --> 04:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
phenomenon where you get a group of
 
04:57:01.910 --> 04:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
people together for reasons other than
 
04:57:03.890 --> 04:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
buying health insurance they're together
 
04:57:05.330 --> 04:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
because they're working for their
 
04:57:09.050 --> 04:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
employer and so you inherently get a
 
04:57:11.930 --> 04:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
coverage group that isn't necessarily
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
high risk from a health insurance
 
04:57:14.400 --> 04:57:15.770 align:start position:0%
high risk from a health insurance
perspective

04:57:15.770 --> 04:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
04:57:18.288 --> 04:57:18.298 align:start position:0%
in the individual Market you have people
 
04:57:20.570 --> 04:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
buying coverage one by one because they
 
04:57:23.448 --> 04:57:23.458 align:start position:0%
want it and they're more likely to be
 
04:57:25.490 --> 04:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
high risk individuals
 
04:57:27.948 --> 04:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
for that reason this Market has always
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
been unstable in New Hampshire and in
 
04:57:33.410 --> 04:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
other states as well
 
04:57:36.430 --> 04:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
so originally in order to
 
04:57:39.128 --> 04:57:39.138 align:start position:0%
keep the market
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
vital and competitive the first program
 
04:57:44.690 --> 04:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
that was set up was called a risk
 
04:57:49.570 --> 04:57:49.580 align:start position:0%
subsidy mechanism whereby all
 
04:57:53.570 --> 04:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
insurers group and individual offering
 
04:57:56.090 --> 04:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
coverage in the state were assessed a
 
04:57:59.150 --> 04:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
small amount and that funding was used
 
04:58:02.330 --> 04:58:02.340 align:start position:0%
to pay for some of the excess risk in
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
the individual Market
 
04:58:06.190 --> 04:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
so that was the risk subsidy mechanism
 
04:58:09.050 --> 04:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
and then came the high-risk pool which
 
04:58:11.090 --> 04:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
is a different way of doing it
 
04:58:14.448 --> 04:58:14.458 align:start position:0%
where you don't require the carriers in
 
04:58:16.810 --> 04:58:16.820 align:start position:0%
individual Market to accept everyone
 
04:58:21.670 --> 04:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
but you do require that there be a
 
04:58:23.868 --> 04:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
source of coverage for people who are
 
04:58:26.628 --> 04:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
high risk and that that has to be
 
04:58:26.638 --> 04:58:27.890 align:start position:0%
high risk and that that has to be
subsidized

04:58:27.890 --> 04:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
subsidized
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
so we had that we had risk subsidy
 
04:58:34.628 --> 04:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
mechanism in the hybris pool and
 
04:58:37.610 --> 04:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
today we have a reinsurance mechanism
 
04:58:40.128 --> 04:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
which essentially does the same sort of
 
04:58:42.530 --> 04:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
thing it pays for some of the excess
 
04:58:44.750 --> 04:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
risk in the individual market so the
 
04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
premiums can be affordable
 
04:58:47.280 --> 04:58:48.410 align:start position:0%
premiums can be affordable
everything

04:58:48.410 --> 04:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:58:48.420 --> 04:58:49.810 align:start position:0%
everything
okay

04:58:49.810 --> 04:58:49.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
04:58:54.170 --> 04:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
our guests
 
04:58:56.930 --> 04:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
I was seeing none thank you very much uh
 
04:58:59.510 --> 04:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
I don't have any more cards for 389 was
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
there anybody else that would like to
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill I'm sorry yeah 6
 
04:59:03.600 --> 04:59:05.090 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill I'm sorry yeah 6
13.

or 389 but 6 13.
 
04:59:10.610 --> 04:59:10.620 align:start position:0%
all right well I don't see any close to
 
04:59:12.948 --> 04:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you and then we'll open
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:19.850 --> 04:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
and now we're 55 minutes behind schedule
 
04:59:25.030 --> 04:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
so open the hearing

04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
I'm introducing them they're introducing
 
04:59:47.448 --> 04:59:47.458 align:start position:0%
the bill all right so I do to answer

your question yes I do support it
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
before I get started I um there I I'm
 
04:59:55.128 --> 04:59:55.138 align:start position:0%
going to make reference to a document
 
04:59:58.010 --> 04:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's 300 pages long and I've emailed it
 
04:59:59.810 --> 04:59:59.820 align:start position:0%
to each of you instead of making copies
 
05:00:02.270 --> 05:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
of it the other thing is that I've
 
05:00:04.430 --> 05:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
recently lost a tooth implant so I have
 
05:00:07.250 --> 05:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
a wee bit of a lisp I've emailed you my
 
05:00:09.590 --> 05:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
testimony as well in case you can't
 
05:00:12.110 --> 05:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
understand me for some reason
 
05:00:13.730 --> 05:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
could you just just state your name for
 
05:00:15.170 --> 05:00:15.180 align:start position:0%

for the record I am representative Wendy
 
05:00:24.410 --> 05:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
Thomas representing the town of
 
05:00:24.420 --> 05:00:25.490 align:start position:0%
Thomas representing the town of
Merrimack

05:00:25.490 --> 05:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
Merrimack
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
I come before you to introduce HB for
 
05:00:31.368 --> 05:00:31.378 align:start position:0%
414 relative to health insurance
 
05:00:34.730 --> 05:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
coverage for preventive pfas care
 
05:00:36.890 --> 05:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
this bill came about due to a few
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
reasons some personal
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
recently I was diagnosed with breast
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
cancer I have no history of breast
 
05:00:44.690 --> 05:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
cancer in my family
 
05:00:47.628 --> 05:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
I had genetic testing and the 13 genes
 
05:00:50.930 --> 05:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
they tested me for were all negative I
 
05:00:53.810 --> 05:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
did not have those genetic mutations
 
05:00:55.610 --> 05:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
on the advice of the environmental
 
05:00:58.310 --> 05:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
working group I had my blood tested for
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%

eurofins
 
05:01:05.690 --> 05:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
it turns out I have 12 pfas chemicals in
 
05:01:07.970 --> 05:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
my body that are over the toxic limit
 
05:01:09.470 --> 05:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
for humans
 
05:01:13.368 --> 05:01:13.378 align:start position:0%
my total pfas chemicals are 38 times
 
05:01:15.530 --> 05:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
over the national average
 
05:01:18.410 --> 05:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
P fast chemical exposure has been linked
 
05:01:19.970 --> 05:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
to breast cancer
 
05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
because of this I opted for a double
 
05:01:22.080 --> 05:01:25.670 align:start position:0%
because of this I opted for a double
mastectomy

05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:28.850 --> 05:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
I have more total pfoa in my body than
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
99 of Americans do
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
pfoa chemicals have been linked to
 
05:01:37.010 --> 05:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
ovarian and fallopian tube cancer
 
05:01:38.690 --> 05:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
based on this information the
 
05:01:41.208 --> 05:01:41.218 align:start position:0%
oncologists I saw at Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
05:01:43.850 --> 05:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
Lebanon felt it was prudent to
 
05:01:45.770 --> 05:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
preventively remove my ovaries and
 
05:01:47.330 --> 05:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
fallopian tubes
 
05:01:50.208 --> 05:01:50.218 align:start position:0%
initially this surgery was denied it
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
took several hours on the phone and my
 
05:01:54.410 --> 05:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
doctor recoding the surgery for it
 
05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
finally to be approved
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
because I have gone public with my
 
05:02:00.170 --> 05:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
cancer story in our town a young woman
 
05:02:02.208 --> 05:02:02.218 align:start position:0%
contacted me she is the daughter of a
 
05:02:04.010 --> 05:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
mom with breast cancer
 
05:02:06.110 --> 05:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
when she had an abnormality with her
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
breast she was referred to a breast
 
05:02:07.920 --> 05:02:09.230 align:start position:0%

05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
clinic
 
05:02:11.690 --> 05:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
they examined her and told her that she
 
05:02:14.810 --> 05:02:14.820 align:start position:0%
had dense breast tissue when she asked
 
05:02:16.550 --> 05:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
about a mammogram she was told that she
 
05:02:19.128 --> 05:02:19.138 align:start position:0%
didn't qualify because she was 24 and
 
05:02:21.890 --> 05:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
they quote don't offer mammograms until
 
05:02:23.810 --> 05:02:23.820 align:start position:0%
you are 29.
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
for a young woman who has known pfas
 
05:02:28.970 --> 05:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
contamination waiting five years for a
 
05:02:32.330 --> 05:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
mammogram might be a death sentence
 
05:02:34.550 --> 05:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
the science of pfas and health has been
 
05:02:36.288 --> 05:02:36.298 align:start position:0%
steadily marching on and we need to
 
05:02:38.030 --> 05:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into Health Care
 
05:02:40.730 --> 05:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
standards in the greater Merrimack area
 
05:02:43.850 --> 05:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
we have seven towns with nhdes
 
05:02:46.970 --> 05:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
identified long-term pfas exposure to
 
05:02:49.070 --> 05:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
thousands of residents
 
05:02:51.410 --> 05:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
many residents in my town have contacted
 
05:02:53.868 --> 05:02:53.878 align:start position:0%
me with their cancer stories according
 
05:02:55.850 --> 05:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
to a state analysis of cancer rates we
 
05:02:58.550 --> 05:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
have high rates of breast cancer ovarian
 
05:03:01.010 --> 05:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
and prostate cancer in this area
 
05:03:03.050 --> 05:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
I have been told of young women in our
 
05:03:04.730 --> 05:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
town who have been diagnosed with
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
ovarian failure they will not be able to
 
05:03:09.288 --> 05:03:09.298 align:start position:0%
have their own children
 
05:03:11.570 --> 05:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
we also have a lot of cardiac conditions
 
05:03:14.890 --> 05:03:14.900 align:start position:0%
in our town many heart attacks stents
 
05:03:17.448 --> 05:03:17.458 align:start position:0%
diagnosed irregularities of electrical

activity and cardiomyopathy
 
05:03:23.150 --> 05:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
my husband who also has elevated levels
 
05:03:25.850 --> 05:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
of pfas in his body had a quadruple
 
05:03:28.910 --> 05:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
bypass at the age of 55.
 
05:03:30.890 --> 05:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
we are also seeing high levels of

05:03:38.930 --> 05:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
we now know that women who ingest pfas

contaminated water at the levels we are
 
05:03:43.368 --> 05:03:43.378 align:start position:0%
seeing in our town are giving birth to

this is all consistent with pfas
 
05:03:54.050 --> 05:03:54.060 align:start position:0%

we now know that pfas is is definitely
 
05:04:02.930 --> 05:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
linked to several Cancers and we are
 
05:04:04.970 --> 05:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
learning of new of new connections every

05:04:49.970 --> 05:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
this bill would require insurance

companies to cover pfas related
 
05:04:55.190 --> 05:04:55.200 align:start position:0%

CDC is obviously Center for Disease

you will hear from the insurance
 
05:05:18.230 --> 05:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
lobbyists that if a doctor orders it
 
05:05:20.208 --> 05:05:20.218 align:start position:0%
then it will either be approved or the
 
05:05:22.490 --> 05:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
patient can file an appeal we all know
 
05:05:24.948 --> 05:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
that's not true my surgery was initially
 
05:05:28.190 --> 05:05:28.200 align:start position:0%

total pfas blood volume of 20
 
05:06:10.610 --> 05:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
nanograms per milliliter is what would
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
trigger the pfas related preventive care
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
this would mean monitoring infants for

autistic symptoms and learning
 
05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:20.638 align:start position:0%

blood sugar and hormone monitoring if
 
05:06:27.050 --> 05:06:27.060 align:start position:0%

Young ages
 
05:06:32.090 --> 05:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
it means allowing women to have

preventive mastectomies if they choose
 
05:06:36.650 --> 05:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
it means allowing women to preventively

remove ovaries Fallopian tubes and their
 
05:06:40.970 --> 05:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
uterus if they choose
 
05:06:43.368 --> 05:06:43.378 align:start position:0%
it means monitoring indicators of

mammograms
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
in the document I sent you by email
 
05:06:56.930 --> 05:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
there are guidelines for physician
 
05:06:58.430 --> 05:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
treatment of people who have 20
 
05:07:01.490 --> 05:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
nanograms per milliliter or higher in
 
05:07:03.948 --> 05:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
their blood these guidelines will soon
 
05:07:08.390 --> 05:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
be adopted by the CT CDC atsdr but there
 
05:07:11.690 --> 05:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
is no federal regulatory requirement for
 
05:07:14.890 --> 05:07:14.900 align:start position:0%
insurers to provide for pfas related
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
excuse me pfas related care
 
05:07:20.090 --> 05:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
this is why the New Hampshire
 
05:07:22.550 --> 05:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
legislative body previously passed a
 
05:07:24.770 --> 05:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
requirement for insurers to cover the
 
05:07:27.890 --> 05:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
costs of pfas blood testing in our state
 
05:07:30.650 --> 05:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
that was that was two terms ago this
 
05:07:33.770 --> 05:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
bill builds upon that requirement
 
05:07:35.868 --> 05:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note suggests that this bill
 
05:07:38.810 --> 05:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
might raise insurance premiums updating
 
05:07:40.910 --> 05:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
coverage requirements to cover science
 
05:07:43.250 --> 05:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
indicated appropriate Health screenings
 
05:07:45.890 --> 05:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
in areas of known environmental exposure
 
05:07:48.948 --> 05:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
to toxic chemicals will not only save
 
05:07:51.530 --> 05:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
lives it will save the progress the
 
05:07:54.410 --> 05:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
progression of disease and ultimately be
 
05:07:56.330 --> 05:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
less costly
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
despite the Decades of pfas-related
 
05:08:01.270 --> 05:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
science indicating harm to human health
 
05:08:03.470 --> 05:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
corporations are still allowed to
 
05:08:06.230 --> 05:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
discharge and emit toxic pfas chemicals
 
05:08:08.750 --> 05:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
that have contaminated our water sources
 
05:08:10.910 --> 05:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
air and soil
 
05:08:13.490 --> 05:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
it is crucial that residents in known
 
05:08:16.490 --> 05:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
areas of exposure be given the tools we
 
05:08:18.708 --> 05:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
need to diagnose diseases and illnesses
 
05:08:21.590 --> 05:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
as early as possible so that we can be
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
properly treated
 
05:08:25.610 --> 05:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
this bill asks that our health care
 
05:08:27.948 --> 05:08:27.958 align:start position:0%
System something we all pay an awful lot
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
of money into do the right thing and
 
05:08:33.310 --> 05:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
cover preventive care based on the
 
05:08:36.948 --> 05:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
atsdr guidelines for this fairly new and
 
05:08:39.770 --> 05:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
very bad presence in our lives
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll take any questions
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and for
 
05:08:47.208 --> 05:08:47.218 align:start position:0%
sharing your personal story thank you
 
05:08:54.350 --> 05:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:58.730 --> 05:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
I went on the CDC and I and I went to
 
05:09:04.490 --> 05:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
the 18 SDR website to look for the
 
05:09:04.500 --> 05:09:05.868 align:start position:0%
the 18 SDR website to look for the
guidance

05:09:05.868 --> 05:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
05:09:08.510 --> 05:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
and in all honesty I couldn't find
 
05:09:10.788 --> 05:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
anything other than
 
05:09:13.250 --> 05:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
check with your doctor
 
05:09:14.810 --> 05:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to be looking at the
 
05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
atsd guidelines is that in the 300 Page
 
05:09:20.208 --> 05:09:20.218 align:start position:0%
document that you're providing I I don't
 
05:09:22.368 --> 05:09:22.378 align:start position:0%
know where that is the 300 Page document
 
05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
yes that's considered the gold standard
 
05:09:26.570 --> 05:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
what I sent you and it's called The
 
05:09:28.970 --> 05:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
Guidance on pfas exposure testing and
 
05:09:31.850 --> 05:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
clinical follow-up 2022.
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me one follow-up
 
05:09:35.448 --> 05:09:35.458 align:start position:0%
the only other thing that I saw on it
 
05:09:37.550 --> 05:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
was that they said that getting tested
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
for pfas levels in your blood is very
 
05:09:43.788 --> 05:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
difficult and they're not not an easily
 
05:09:45.788 --> 05:09:45.798 align:start position:0%
accessible test
 
05:09:48.770 --> 05:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh do we even know if we have facilities
 
05:09:52.970 --> 05:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
here that could do that
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure if we have them in the
 
05:09:57.288 --> 05:09:57.298 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire but Quest lab
 
05:10:00.708 --> 05:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
does uh test for pfas and it is a a
 
05:10:02.030 --> 05:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
codable test
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
um but if you ask your doctor about it
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
he's not gonna or he or she is not going
 
05:10:07.730 --> 05:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
to know about it they're not gonna it's
 
05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to find the number I've talked
 
05:10:11.330 --> 05:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
to many doctors that that just don't
 
05:10:12.590 --> 05:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
even know it first of all they don't
 
05:10:14.270 --> 05:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
know it exists and secondly they don't
 
05:10:16.190 --> 05:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
know how to order it
 
05:10:18.170 --> 05:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
um it might have to be sent out of state
 
05:10:18.180 --> 05:10:20.448 align:start position:0%
um it might have to be sent out of state
though

05:10:20.448 --> 05:10:20.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:25.730 --> 05:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:28.190 --> 05:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you representative
 
05:10:31.430 --> 05:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
Thomas just a quick question is this uh
 
05:10:33.170 --> 05:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
Bill unique to New Hampshire or have
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
other states uh try to pass this time of
 
05:10:37.930 --> 05:10:37.940 align:start position:0%
Bill this is the first in the nation
 
05:10:41.690 --> 05:10:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:43.550 --> 05:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative Burroughs
 
05:10:45.530 --> 05:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you um this will be uh what do you
 
05:10:47.090 --> 05:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
do you believe question first of all
 
05:10:49.010 --> 05:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for that compelling testimony
 
05:10:52.070 --> 05:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
and I just uh last session we heard from
 
05:10:53.930 --> 05:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Chase who you
 
05:10:56.030 --> 05:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
probably know who lost her adult
 
05:10:56.040 --> 05:10:57.230 align:start position:0%
probably know who lost her adult
daughter

05:10:57.230 --> 05:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
05:11:00.288 --> 05:11:00.298 align:start position:0%
um related to they believe related to
 
05:11:03.530 --> 05:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
pfas contamination and she was frankly
 
05:11:05.868 --> 05:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
disparaged for some of her testimony so
 
05:11:08.448 --> 05:11:08.458 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that um this this hearing may
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
lead to
 
05:11:12.590 --> 05:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
um action um for people like you because
 
05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry for what you had to go
 
05:11:15.410 --> 05:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
through thank you
 
05:11:15.420 --> 05:11:16.850 align:start position:0%
through thank you
um

05:11:16.850 --> 05:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:19.128 --> 05:11:19.138 align:start position:0%
I have people in my town oh we seem to
 
05:11:20.570 --> 05:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
have reached a Tipping Point in
 
05:11:23.330 --> 05:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
Merrimack um the canaries in the coal
 
05:11:25.208 --> 05:11:25.218 align:start position:0%
mine are the small animals that we have
 
05:11:28.128 --> 05:11:28.138 align:start position:0%
and our cats and dogs are dying if cats
 
05:11:29.810 --> 05:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
are left and right I've just put down my
 
05:11:31.490 --> 05:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
fourth I have the little dogs I've got
 
05:11:33.110 --> 05:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
the bedroom slipper dogs you know the
 
05:11:35.448 --> 05:11:35.458 align:start position:0%
little guys I've just put down my fourth
 
05:11:40.128 --> 05:11:40.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:44.810 --> 05:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
okay good question oh yep representative
 
05:11:47.690 --> 05:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
as I am uh growing in my uh awareness of
 
05:11:51.610 --> 05:11:51.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:54.410 --> 05:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
of this issue I'm wondering if you could
 
05:11:58.128 --> 05:11:58.138 align:start position:0%
uh and I just uh downloaded an article
 
05:12:01.550 --> 05:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
from the uh the EPA on uh pfas and just
 
05:12:03.470 --> 05:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
glanced at it as I was trying to listen
 
05:12:06.770 --> 05:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
to you more intently of course uh could
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
you speak to why it is that Merrimack
 
05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
appears to be a center for uh pfas uh
 
05:12:16.550 --> 05:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
problems it sounds quite
 
05:12:21.288 --> 05:12:21.298 align:start position:0%
um uh in quite urgent and quite intense
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
it is uh urgent and intense those are
 
05:12:26.090 --> 05:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
good words to explain it we have an
 
05:12:28.610 --> 05:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
industrial polluter in our town that has
 
05:12:32.990 --> 05:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
been spewing uh pfas into the water and
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
the air for decades
 
05:12:39.230 --> 05:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
um they self-reported in 2016 that that
 
05:12:41.750 --> 05:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
they were over the the limit
 
05:12:44.510 --> 05:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
um they recently put and they've lied
 
05:12:46.610 --> 05:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
they there's a Boston Globe article
 
05:12:49.850 --> 05:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
about how they they lied about how much
 
05:12:53.350 --> 05:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
pfas they've put into the into our town
 
05:12:56.090 --> 05:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
recently they put scrubbers on their
 
05:12:58.190 --> 05:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
chimneys what they do at night is they
 
05:13:01.010 --> 05:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
burn their refuse which creates
 
05:13:03.590 --> 05:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
particulate which then comes down on the
 
05:13:03.600 --> 05:13:04.368 align:start position:0%
particulate which then comes down on the
town

05:13:04.368 --> 05:13:04.378 align:start position:0%
town
 
05:13:07.310 --> 05:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
and then the rain drives that into our
 
05:13:10.730 --> 05:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
water system as well as the plants take
 
05:13:13.550 --> 05:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
it up so our produce is infected and
 
05:13:16.010 --> 05:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
contaminated with pfas as well
 
05:13:18.830 --> 05:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
this has been going on for a long time
 
05:13:18.840 --> 05:13:19.788 align:start position:0%
this has been going on for a long time
um

05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:22.850 --> 05:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
when we first in 2016 when we first
 
05:13:25.850 --> 05:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
found out about this we were told by the
 
05:13:28.610 --> 05:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh Des that only
 
05:13:30.530 --> 05:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
the people that lived within half a mile
 
05:13:34.010 --> 05:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
of this industrial complex needed to
 
05:13:36.650 --> 05:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
worry about their water then they did
 
05:13:38.208 --> 05:13:38.218 align:start position:0%
some more testing and they said no we
 
05:13:40.190 --> 05:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
were wrong people that live within a
 
05:13:43.490 --> 05:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
mile of this industrial complex need to
 
05:13:46.490 --> 05:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
be concerned I lived three miles from
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
this Corporation we have a private well
 
05:13:53.030 --> 05:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
I had my well tested in 2016. the
 
05:13:54.590 --> 05:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
results were so high we had to shut our
 
05:13:55.550 --> 05:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
well down
 
05:13:57.650 --> 05:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
a house without well water as a house
 
05:14:00.050 --> 05:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
without water so we had to put in a
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
whole house filtration system at a cost
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
of about five thousand dollars along
 
05:14:06.590 --> 05:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
with an RO which is reverse osmosis
 
05:14:06.600 --> 05:14:07.550 align:start position:0%
with an RO which is reverse osmosis
system

05:14:07.550 --> 05:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:14:11.090 --> 05:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
we only used the RO water for drinking
 
05:14:14.090 --> 05:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm one of the three water Warriors
 
05:14:17.090 --> 05:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
that that came up two terms ago I did
 
05:14:19.368 --> 05:14:19.378 align:start position:0%
everything right you know I I did
 
05:14:20.930 --> 05:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
exactly what they told us to do I
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
filtered our water we stopped you know
 
05:14:25.310 --> 05:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
everything and I have these kind of
 
05:14:28.550 --> 05:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
blood blood levels if if I have these
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
levels what chance do do the rest of the
 
05:14:32.448 --> 05:14:32.458 align:start position:0%
people in my town have
 
05:14:35.150 --> 05:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
quick follow really question
 
05:14:37.128 --> 05:14:37.138 align:start position:0%
so you would say that with with respect
 
05:14:39.288 --> 05:14:39.298 align:start position:0%
to Merrimack that the the major
 
05:14:42.050 --> 05:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
contributing contributor to the the
 
05:14:45.050 --> 05:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
health problems that you are uh speaking
 
05:14:48.470 --> 05:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
to today uh with respect to uh uh
 
05:14:50.930 --> 05:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
residents and and pets uh in in
 
05:14:53.628 --> 05:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
Merrimack uh but is this particular
 
05:14:57.170 --> 05:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
corporation and its its practices such
 
05:15:00.530 --> 05:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
that the water is the prime source of of
 
05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
the uh pollution if you will the water
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
is is the most significant Source um of
 
05:15:08.270 --> 05:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
course it goes into the rivers and we've
 
05:15:11.230 --> 05:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
tested our fish and and the um
 
05:15:13.850 --> 05:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
suggestion what the it's more than a
 
05:15:13.860 --> 05:15:15.110 align:start position:0%
suggestion what the it's more than a
suggestion

05:15:15.110 --> 05:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
05:15:16.730 --> 05:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
um don't eat the fish if you catch it
 
05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
release it because they're so high in
 
05:15:20.690 --> 05:15:20.700 align:start position:0%
pfest I recently I think it was two days
 
05:15:23.510 --> 05:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
ago I saw an article by uh CBS news that
 
05:15:25.670 --> 05:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
said eating one fish that's contaminated
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
with pfas is equivalent to drinking one
 
05:15:29.810 --> 05:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
month's worth of water that is
 
05:15:32.208 --> 05:15:32.218 align:start position:0%
contaminated with pfas so you really
 
05:15:35.530 --> 05:15:35.540 align:start position:0%
don't want to eat those fish
 
05:15:40.850 --> 05:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:44.110 --> 05:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
a few months ago uh my my sister
 
05:15:47.030 --> 05:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
received a notice that she's no longer
 
05:15:48.770 --> 05:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
allowed to drink the water
 
05:15:51.110 --> 05:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
and that some company is providing
 
05:15:53.208 --> 05:15:53.218 align:start position:0%
bottled water to their house and they're
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
told don't drink any water is that and
 
05:15:57.890 --> 05:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
she lives in Bedford
 
05:15:59.930 --> 05:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
is that the same company that's
 
05:16:02.510 --> 05:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
infecting the water in Merrimack it is
 
05:16:04.730 --> 05:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
it is our family so it's that distance
 
05:16:08.090 --> 05:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
oh it's it's seven it's seven uh towns
 
05:16:09.948 --> 05:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
around Merrimack so here's the thing
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
water flows air flows you know just it's
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
not going to stay in our town it's
 
05:16:17.448 --> 05:16:17.458 align:start position:0%
slowly I mean Bedford is slowly seeing
 
05:16:19.550 --> 05:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
you know more and more health issues
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
because of this Nashua is going to start
 
05:16:24.350 --> 05:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
seeing more and more health issues
 
05:16:26.150 --> 05:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
um these are called Forever chemicals
 
05:16:28.128 --> 05:16:28.138 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the technology
 
05:16:30.170 --> 05:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
right now to break them down
 
05:16:33.110 --> 05:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
they are they will forever be in in our
 
05:16:35.570 --> 05:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
soil they will forever be in our water
 
05:16:37.850 --> 05:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
unless we can filter it out they will
 
05:16:39.590 --> 05:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
forever be in my body
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:46.670 --> 05:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
yeah representative post
 
05:16:48.650 --> 05:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
I have a would you believe
 
05:16:48.660 --> 05:16:53.868 align:start position:0%
I have a would you believe
in

05:16:53.868 --> 05:16:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:57.530 --> 05:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh last term we had a waste uh treatment
 
05:16:59.930 --> 05:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
come in and they were saying they
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
remediated it using wood chips and they
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
were taking those wood chips after they
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
combined them washed them and everything
 
05:17:12.770 --> 05:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
and they are putting them in playgrounds
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
I unfortunately would believe that
 
05:17:17.650 --> 05:17:17.660 align:start position:0%
happens because people are not
 
05:17:21.770 --> 05:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
well-versed in in how pfas is so
 
05:17:25.128 --> 05:17:25.138 align:start position:0%
dangerous to I mean that is appalling
 
05:17:26.390 --> 05:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
that they would put that where children
 
05:17:30.230 --> 05:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:32.868 --> 05:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh chair with Cullen Heidi Kroll from
 
05:17:36.000 --> 05:17:51.650 align:start position:0%
uh uh chair with Cullen Heidi Kroll from
ahib

05:17:51.650 --> 05:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:51.660 --> 05:17:52.510 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:17:52.510 --> 05:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:17:55.010 --> 05:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
05:17:56.448 --> 05:17:56.458 align:start position:0%
of the committee um for the record my
 
05:17:58.550 --> 05:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
name is Heidi Kroll I work at Gallagher
 
05:18:00.110 --> 05:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
Kelly Hannah gartrell and I represent
 
05:18:02.270 --> 05:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
ahip America's health insurance plans
 
05:18:04.490 --> 05:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
which is the trade Association for the
 
05:18:06.530 --> 05:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
health insurance carriers
 
05:18:06.540 --> 05:18:07.490 align:start position:0%
health insurance carriers
um

05:18:07.490 --> 05:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:09.230 --> 05:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
I want to say that we certainly
 
05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
sympathize with the um
 
05:18:13.730 --> 05:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
story you know the personal experience
 
05:18:16.910 --> 05:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
of Representative Thomas and we did chat
 
05:18:18.770 --> 05:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
with her actually last week I think it
 
05:18:21.350 --> 05:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
was about this legislation
 
05:18:21.360 --> 05:18:22.550 align:start position:0%
was about this legislation
um

05:18:22.550 --> 05:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:26.330 --> 05:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh we we are opposed to the bill
 
05:18:28.490 --> 05:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
um I think largely because it's kind of
 
05:18:31.010 --> 05:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
a mandate before its time
 
05:18:36.170 --> 05:18:36.180 align:start position:0%
um the federal guidance is uh still you
 
05:18:37.610 --> 05:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
know kind of catching up to I think
 
05:18:40.490 --> 05:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
where maybe some of the scientists are
 
05:18:42.410 --> 05:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
around this
 
05:18:44.090 --> 05:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the um guidance
 
05:18:50.690 --> 05:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
which was referenced
 
05:18:54.230 --> 05:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh was is part of a report from the
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
national academies and that was
 
05:19:02.930 --> 05:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
um a report to the CDC and the atsdr
 
05:19:07.090 --> 05:19:07.100 align:start position:0%
um and but the the CDC and the at
 
05:19:10.910 --> 05:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
SDR have not adopted any of those
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
recommendations yet
 
05:19:15.970 --> 05:19:15.980 align:start position:0%
so if you go on to the
 
05:19:20.390 --> 05:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
CDC and at SDR websites
 
05:19:20.400 --> 05:19:21.708 align:start position:0%
CDC and at SDR websites
um

05:19:21.708 --> 05:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:23.810 --> 05:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
you'll see first of all from the
 
05:19:26.030 --> 05:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
patient's perspective
 
05:19:26.040 --> 05:19:26.690 align:start position:0%
patient's perspective
um

05:19:26.690 --> 05:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:29.390 --> 05:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
what is recommended for the patient so
 
05:19:31.850 --> 05:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
the CDC website says for example we
 
05:19:34.010 --> 05:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
don't know if exposure to pfas may cause
 
05:19:35.930 --> 05:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
health problems in the future you can
 
05:19:37.788 --> 05:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
talk to your doctor if you have been
 
05:19:39.708 --> 05:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
exposed to pfas and ask if you need to
 
05:19:41.628 --> 05:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
be monitored for symptoms or conditions
 
05:19:44.090 --> 05:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
that may be caused by P P fast exposure
 
05:19:45.430 --> 05:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
05:19:48.110 --> 05:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
and then they go on to say some of the
 
05:19:49.910 --> 05:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
health effects possibly linked to P fast
 
05:19:51.948 --> 05:19:51.958 align:start position:0%
exposure like high cholesterol can be
 
05:19:53.890 --> 05:19:53.900 align:start position:0%
checked as part of your annual physical
 
05:19:55.910 --> 05:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
and it's important to have regular
 
05:19:58.430 --> 05:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
checkups and screenings and it goes
 
05:19:59.810 --> 05:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
finally on to say you can talk to your
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
doctor about any exposure to pfas and
 
05:20:05.330 --> 05:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
any symptoms you have if you then go to
 
05:20:08.750 --> 05:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
the clinician guidance and this is in a
 
05:20:10.910 --> 05:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
document that's a short review and
 
05:20:14.510 --> 05:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:17.448 --> 05:20:17.458 align:start position:0%
you'll see that really the guidance is
 
05:20:21.128 --> 05:20:21.138 align:start position:0%
for patients concerned about exposure
 
05:20:23.990 --> 05:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
first of all identify and reduce the
 
05:20:25.550 --> 05:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
current sources of environmental
 
05:20:28.430 --> 05:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
exposure and then secondly promoting
 
05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
standard age-appropriate preventative
 
05:20:32.628 --> 05:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
care measures for General Health and
 
05:20:32.638 --> 05:20:34.030 align:start position:0%
care measures for General Health and
Wellness

05:20:34.030 --> 05:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
Wellness
 
05:20:36.770 --> 05:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
and it goes on to talk about
 
05:20:36.780 --> 05:20:37.430 align:start position:0%
and it goes on to talk about
um

05:20:37.430 --> 05:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:40.430 --> 05:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
what to do if people have either if you
 
05:20:42.410 --> 05:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
have asymptomatic individuals or
 
05:20:44.208 --> 05:20:44.218 align:start position:0%
patients with signs or symptoms of
 
05:20:46.430 --> 05:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
disease it says treat using the same
 
05:20:48.590 --> 05:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
established standards of care regardless
 
05:20:52.310 --> 05:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
of pfas exposure so you know I think
 
05:20:55.670 --> 05:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
that the carriers are covering if
 
05:20:58.610 --> 05:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
somebody does have symptoms or
 
05:20:58.620 --> 05:20:59.208 align:start position:0%
somebody does have symptoms or
um

05:20:59.208 --> 05:20:59.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
the Doctor is recommending screening
 
05:21:05.868 --> 05:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
um you know in the cases that
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
any of that is medically necessary the
 
05:21:11.868 --> 05:21:11.878 align:start position:0%
carriers are are covering it and would
 
05:21:13.850 --> 05:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
and will cover it
 
05:21:16.010 --> 05:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
um I think our concern simply as you
 
05:21:18.530 --> 05:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
heard this this is not adopted in any
 
05:21:20.930 --> 05:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
other states in the country in terms of
 
05:21:24.050 --> 05:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
a mandate or or required or mandatory
 
05:21:26.150 --> 05:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
coverage and
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
um I think we just really need to wait
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
for I know it's hard to wait but
 
05:21:33.650 --> 05:21:33.660 align:start position:0%
um the the guidance is really still very
 
05:21:35.690 --> 05:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
much in flux in development and kind of
 
05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
wishy-washy and you know carriers when
 
05:21:41.448 --> 05:21:41.458 align:start position:0%
they're determining their coverage Look
 
05:21:43.430 --> 05:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
to You know they have their panel of
 
05:21:46.430 --> 05:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
experts continually looking at
 
05:21:48.948 --> 05:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
um where the where the science is going
 
05:21:51.410 --> 05:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
where the medical care is going and
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
really make sure that things are
 
05:21:55.970 --> 05:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
evidence-based so I'm happy to try to
 
05:21:57.770 --> 05:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
05:22:00.470 --> 05:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Burroughs
 
05:22:02.208 --> 05:22:02.218 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:22:02.218 --> 05:22:03.590 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:22:03.590 --> 05:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:22:06.170 --> 05:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
um the first part is what what would you
 
05:22:08.330 --> 05:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
believe which we have had evidence from
 
05:22:10.070 --> 05:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas in the past
 
05:22:13.490 --> 05:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative Chase of anecdotal
 
05:22:15.170 --> 05:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
evidence of patients who are not getting
 
05:22:17.330 --> 05:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
care they're being turned away because
 
05:22:18.708 --> 05:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
of their they're they're not being
 
05:22:21.110 --> 05:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
covered by insurance and the next if I
 
05:22:23.208 --> 05:22:23.218 align:start position:0%
could the next part of my question is I
 
05:22:25.788 --> 05:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
guess is how many cancer patients sick
 
05:22:28.550 --> 05:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
children and deaths do we have to that
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
are are found to be related to pfast do
 
05:22:32.868 --> 05:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
we need to see before we don't feel that
 
05:22:35.570 --> 05:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
this is a bill before it's time
 
05:22:38.270 --> 05:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so in response to your first
 
05:22:40.910 --> 05:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
question my understanding is that um the
 
05:22:42.770 --> 05:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
care that representative Thomas received
 
05:22:45.470 --> 05:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately was covered covered so
 
05:22:46.970 --> 05:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
initially my understanding that there
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
was a coding
 
05:22:48.718 --> 05:22:49.430 align:start position:0%
was a coding
um

05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:51.590 --> 05:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding I guess with how the
 
05:22:54.110 --> 05:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
provider initially coded the care
 
05:22:54.120 --> 05:22:55.550 align:start position:0%
provider initially coded the care
um

05:22:55.550 --> 05:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:58.128 --> 05:22:58.138 align:start position:0%
okay I apologize that was my
 
05:22:59.930 --> 05:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
understanding that there was Ultimate
 
05:23:01.490 --> 05:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
that there was at least for part of the
 
05:23:03.170 --> 05:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
care that there was some sort of coding
 
05:23:05.390 --> 05:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
problem which ultimately
 
05:23:07.970 --> 05:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
um you know care was initially denied
 
05:23:10.850 --> 05:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
um the provider went back and provided
 
05:23:12.530 --> 05:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
additional information and ultimately it
 
05:23:14.030 --> 05:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
was covered
 
05:23:17.208 --> 05:23:17.218 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't have a good I'm not
 
05:23:19.010 --> 05:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
a scientist I don't have a good answer
 
05:23:19.020 --> 05:23:20.690 align:start position:0%
a scientist I don't have a good answer
for

05:23:20.690 --> 05:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:23:22.250 --> 05:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
05:23:22.260 --> 05:23:23.930 align:start position:0%
um you know
the

05:23:23.930 --> 05:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:23:26.868 --> 05:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
the body of evidence that needs to to be
 
05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
brought forth for New Hampshire to have
 
05:23:30.830 --> 05:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
a mandate but I do know that
 
05:23:34.250 --> 05:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
um you know the carriers do look toward
 
05:23:36.050 --> 05:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
um medical necessity and kind of the
 
05:23:37.910 --> 05:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
body of evidence that is
 
05:23:39.708 --> 05:23:39.718 align:start position:0%
um pointing in a particular direction
 
05:23:41.868 --> 05:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
and and again when you go on the CDC
 
05:23:45.410 --> 05:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
website and the um the I'm going to get
 
05:23:49.128 --> 05:23:49.138 align:start position:0%
the acronym wrong the at SDR website as
 
05:23:51.050 --> 05:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
I quoted you know it's
 
05:23:51.060 --> 05:23:52.010 align:start position:0%
I quoted you know it's
um

05:23:52.010 --> 05:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:53.690 --> 05:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
I quoted you what's there it's it's
 
05:23:57.970 --> 05:23:57.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:01.368 --> 05:24:01.378 align:start position:0%
uh representative below thank you Mr
 
05:24:02.708 --> 05:24:02.718 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:24:05.390 --> 05:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh in your testimony
 
05:24:07.490 --> 05:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
um you stated
 
05:24:07.500 --> 05:24:09.110 align:start position:0%
um you stated
that

05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:24:12.650 --> 05:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
we need to control the source the source
 
05:24:14.150 --> 05:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
is there
 
05:24:16.250 --> 05:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
it's not going away so what do you mean
 
05:24:20.448 --> 05:24:20.458 align:start position:0%
by controlling the source of pfas
 
05:24:20.458 --> 05:24:23.030 align:start position:0%
by controlling the source of pfas
I'm

05:24:23.030 --> 05:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:24:26.090 --> 05:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
I think I was if I'm remembering
 
05:24:27.948 --> 05:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
correctly I was quoting
 
05:24:27.958 --> 05:24:28.550 align:start position:0%
correctly I was quoting
um

05:24:28.550 --> 05:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
this is information off of the short
 
05:24:33.170 --> 05:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
review and guidance for Collision
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
clinicians so this is the CDC and the
 
05:24:38.690 --> 05:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
atsdr guidance and they talk about how
 
05:24:40.430 --> 05:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
many how many clinicians approach
 
05:24:42.770 --> 05:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
patient care for pfas exposed
 
05:24:46.610 --> 05:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
individuals and so the first thing they
 
05:24:49.010 --> 05:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
say is to identify and reduce current
 
05:24:52.250 --> 05:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
sources of environmental exposure
 
05:24:54.170 --> 05:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
so that's I mean I'm just reading what's
 
05:24:57.170 --> 05:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
on that website just to follow up these
 
05:24:58.970 --> 05:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
are forever chemicals they will always
 
05:25:00.170 --> 05:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
be in the water
 
05:25:03.288 --> 05:25:03.298 align:start position:0%
so what do you have to say about that
 
05:25:05.150 --> 05:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
well it's real
 
05:25:08.090 --> 05:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
I understand I I'm not the CDC but you
 
05:25:10.910 --> 05:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
know I I think the you know you have to
 
05:25:12.830 --> 05:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
do things like you know try to get a
 
05:25:14.390 --> 05:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
different source of water as as is
 
05:25:15.890 --> 05:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
happening in some of these towns as an
 
05:25:15.900 --> 05:25:17.270 align:start position:0%
happening in some of these towns as an
example

05:25:17.270 --> 05:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:25:19.128 --> 05:25:19.138 align:start position:0%
um I mean my understanding is that you
 
05:25:20.750 --> 05:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
know to some level Or Another We're All
 
05:25:23.390 --> 05:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
exposed to pfas obviously there's a
 
05:25:25.190 --> 05:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
different situation in Merrimack and the
 
05:25:27.890 --> 05:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns
 
05:25:30.050 --> 05:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
but I heard it was uh they talk about
 
05:25:32.390 --> 05:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
the water we're drinking now is the same
 
05:25:35.448 --> 05:25:35.458 align:start position:0%
it could be dinosaur p
 
05:25:38.208 --> 05:25:38.218 align:start position:0%
the water the water is all the same
 
05:25:39.830 --> 05:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
water I'm just saying it's all it's just
 
05:25:39.840 --> 05:25:40.910 align:start position:0%
water I'm just saying it's all it's just
water

05:25:40.910 --> 05:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:25:42.770 --> 05:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
no it's not about the pfas I'm just
 
05:25:44.330 --> 05:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
saying that the water the what we have
 
05:25:46.610 --> 05:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
the water now has not changed the Earth
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
hasn't gained water or lost water it's
 
05:25:51.948 --> 05:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
all the same same water if the water is
 
05:25:54.770 --> 05:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:58.128 --> 05:25:58.138 align:start position:0%
I'm exactly I'm reinforcing what you're
 
05:26:00.708 --> 05:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
saying okay is that it's the water is
 
05:26:01.910 --> 05:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
there forever
 
05:26:04.550 --> 05:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
so the pfas once it's in the water is
 
05:26:06.650 --> 05:26:06.660 align:start position:0%
going to be in the water forever
 
05:26:10.250 --> 05:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:13.070 --> 05:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
the chemical doesn't break down right so
 
05:26:14.570 --> 05:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
that's all I was saying he said water is
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
here forever we're stuck with the same
 
05:26:16.440 --> 05:26:17.990 align:start position:0%
here forever we're stuck with the same
water

05:26:17.990 --> 05:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:26:21.250 --> 05:26:21.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
Representative Vincent that's what they
 
05:26:24.910 --> 05:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
did in the evil times
 
05:26:27.770 --> 05:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
and thanks a lot for taking my question
 
05:26:27.780 --> 05:26:28.430 align:start position:0%
and thanks a lot for taking my question
um

05:26:28.430 --> 05:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:29.930 --> 05:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm
 
05:26:32.090 --> 05:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
certainly people oppose bills in a four
 
05:26:34.850 --> 05:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
pills and I'm not here to beat you up in
 
05:26:37.010 --> 05:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form
 
05:26:39.410 --> 05:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
um but do you have an idea when the
 
05:26:40.610 --> 05:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
insurance company is going to
 
05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that they're and I stepped
 
05:26:44.150 --> 05:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
out for a minute maybe this has already
 
05:26:46.070 --> 05:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
been asked and I apologize but do you
 
05:26:47.510 --> 05:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
have any idea when the insurance company
 
05:26:49.910 --> 05:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
is going to acknowledge this problem and
 
05:26:52.910 --> 05:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
then take it on as an insurance polycarb
 
05:26:52.920 --> 05:26:54.230 align:start position:0%
then take it on as an insurance polycarb
coverage

05:26:54.230 --> 05:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
05:26:57.050 --> 05:26:57.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think the the really the issue
 
05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
is that the federal government needs to
 
05:27:02.750 --> 05:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
make further progress with what it's
 
05:27:04.670 --> 05:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
what it's publishing what it's posting
 
05:27:06.530 --> 05:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
what it's giving as recommendations for
 
05:27:09.110 --> 05:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
patients and for cl for clinicians you
 
05:27:10.910 --> 05:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
know they're um as I mentioned the
 
05:27:14.030 --> 05:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers have panels of
 
05:27:16.250 --> 05:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
um uh professional experts you know
 
05:27:17.930 --> 05:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
medical experts who are continually
 
05:27:21.230 --> 05:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the evolution of
 
05:27:24.948 --> 05:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
care standards of care and continually
 
05:27:27.050 --> 05:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
updating their coverage in accordance
 
05:27:28.560 --> 05:27:28.570 align:start position:0%
with that and so
 
05:27:28.570 --> 05:27:28.970 align:start position:0%
with that and so
[Music]

05:27:28.970 --> 05:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:27:28.980 --> 05:27:29.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:27:29.750 --> 05:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:32.030 --> 05:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
I know it's not the answer that people
 
05:27:33.890 --> 05:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
want to hear but I just think you know
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
when you go on the CDC website and the
 
05:27:38.930 --> 05:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
the um the other websites out there even
 
05:27:40.610 --> 05:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
I looked at the Department of Health and
 
05:27:42.110 --> 05:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
Human Services here in New Hampshire I
 
05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
looked at their website they all pretty
 
05:27:46.610 --> 05:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
much say the same thing and and none of
 
05:27:49.490 --> 05:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
them are there yet with this level of
 
05:27:51.530 --> 05:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
these are just recommendations that are
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
in this report uh to the CDC so
 
05:27:57.170 --> 05:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
you know I don't have a time I don't I'm
 
05:27:58.550 --> 05:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
not familiar enough with this issue to
 
05:28:00.610 --> 05:28:00.620 align:start position:0%
have a timeline for you but
 
05:28:03.590 --> 05:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you
 
05:28:07.128 --> 05:28:07.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh it seems maybe
 
05:28:08.930 --> 05:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
I've got this wrong but you were it
 
05:28:10.788 --> 05:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
seemed like you waffled back and forth
 
05:28:12.530 --> 05:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
in your testimony because you started
 
05:28:15.170 --> 05:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
off saying this is a mandate before it's
 
05:28:15.180 --> 05:28:16.250 align:start position:0%
off saying this is a mandate before it's
time

05:28:16.250 --> 05:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
and then later you said there doesn't
 
05:28:21.050 --> 05:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
seem to be a problem with people getting
 
05:28:24.170 --> 05:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
paid for issues getting reimbursed by
 
05:28:27.230 --> 05:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
insurance but clearly there is a problem
 
05:28:29.510 --> 05:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
and clearly there is a problem with with
 
05:28:29.520 --> 05:28:31.250 align:start position:0%
and clearly there is a problem with with
pfas

05:28:31.250 --> 05:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
05:28:33.288 --> 05:28:33.298 align:start position:0%
um so a
 
05:28:35.510 --> 05:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
I guess which is it we in other words
 
05:28:38.810 --> 05:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
you're stating that until the CDC
 
05:28:41.868 --> 05:28:41.878 align:start position:0%
who is questionable with some people as
 
05:28:45.530 --> 05:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
well uh until the CDC or other agencies
 
05:28:49.368 --> 05:28:49.378 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that people are dying from
 
05:28:49.378 --> 05:28:50.810 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that people are dying from
pfas

05:28:50.810 --> 05:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
05:28:53.750 --> 05:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's when the insurance industry will
 
05:28:57.530 --> 05:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
start covering this is that well
 
05:29:00.230 --> 05:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing you I think the the issue
 
05:29:02.570 --> 05:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
is that if if people have
 
05:29:05.990 --> 05:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
symptoms or you know
 
05:29:06.000 --> 05:29:07.368 align:start position:0%
symptoms or you know
um

05:29:07.368 --> 05:29:07.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:10.310 --> 05:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
if there's something indicating that
 
05:29:12.590 --> 05:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
medical testing or medical care is
 
05:29:16.070 --> 05:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
required then that then that is covered
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and my understanding in the little
 
05:29:20.030 --> 05:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
bit of reading I did is that you know
 
05:29:22.190 --> 05:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
for example high cholesterol has there's
 
05:29:25.310 --> 05:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of potential sources for that
 
05:29:27.230 --> 05:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
um and regardless of what the source is
 
05:29:30.410 --> 05:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
your your doctor will test you and treat
 
05:29:31.850 --> 05:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
you appropriately so you know again
 
05:29:33.948 --> 05:29:33.958 align:start position:0%
going back to what's on the CDC website
 
05:29:37.010 --> 05:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
for asymptomatic individuals exposed to
 
05:29:39.050 --> 05:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
pfas there is insufficient evidence to
 
05:29:40.850 --> 05:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
support deviations from established
 
05:29:43.368 --> 05:29:43.378 align:start position:0%
standards of Medical Care It also says
 
05:29:44.990 --> 05:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
for patients with signs or symptoms of
 
05:29:47.570 --> 05:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
disease treat using the same established
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
standards of care regardless of pfas
 
05:29:51.230 --> 05:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
exposure and so what I think what I was
 
05:29:53.570 --> 05:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
trying to convey is that
 
05:29:53.580 --> 05:29:54.230 align:start position:0%
trying to convey is that
um

05:29:54.230 --> 05:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:57.230 --> 05:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
you know those uh standards of care we
 
05:29:58.788 --> 05:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
do cover
 
05:30:01.128 --> 05:30:01.138 align:start position:0%
another question you may inquire thank
 
05:30:01.138 --> 05:30:01.850 align:start position:0%
another question you may inquire thank
you

05:30:01.850 --> 05:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:30:05.030 --> 05:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
so am I to interpret from that that the
 
05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
person such as representative Thomas has
 
05:30:09.550 --> 05:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
to be completely filled with cancer
 
05:30:13.550 --> 05:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
before the insurance industry will
 
05:30:18.948 --> 05:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
insure her and and pay for such patients
 
05:30:21.110 --> 05:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh no I don't think that's true I think
 
05:30:23.690 --> 05:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
her care was covered
 
05:30:24.948 --> 05:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
um I mean I don't want to speak to her
 
05:30:27.350 --> 05:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
medical history and record I only know
 
05:30:29.090 --> 05:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
the little bit that I've heard but you
 
05:30:31.128 --> 05:30:31.138 align:start position:0%
know my understanding is that
 
05:30:36.830 --> 05:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:36.840 --> 05:30:38.690 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:30:38.690 --> 05:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
um is there a code for pfas now in terms
 
05:30:45.410 --> 05:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
of medical there is no code per se so is
 
05:30:48.650 --> 05:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
the problem here is is that if somebody
 
05:30:51.948 --> 05:30:51.958 align:start position:0%
uh could use the word asymptomatic which
 
05:30:53.690 --> 05:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
I probably didn't really know what that
 
05:30:55.310 --> 05:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
word meant until the last couple of
 
05:30:58.190 --> 05:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
years it turns out that I am one of
 
05:31:00.410 --> 05:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
those asymptomatic people uh multiple
 
05:31:04.310 --> 05:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
times so that that uh
 
05:31:09.110 --> 05:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
so the issue is is somebody wants to get
 
05:31:09.120 --> 05:31:11.330 align:start position:0%
so the issue is is somebody wants to get
tested

05:31:11.330 --> 05:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
tested
 
05:31:13.610 --> 05:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
randomly because they don't have
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
anything wrong with them they just want
 
05:31:17.628 --> 05:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
to get a test
 
05:31:20.208 --> 05:31:20.218 align:start position:0%
where what this bill would say is that
 
05:31:22.670 --> 05:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
that that test should be paid for is
 
05:31:24.788 --> 05:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
05:31:28.010 --> 05:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
so it's already paid for it P fast
 
05:31:30.770 --> 05:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
testing in your blood right just to get
 
05:31:32.868 --> 05:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
a test you can get a test now it's
 
05:31:34.190 --> 05:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
already covered I'm sorry I had to walk
 
05:31:35.750 --> 05:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
out of the room that is already okay so
 
05:31:37.970 --> 05:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
that is covered out so I can get that so
 
05:31:40.070 --> 05:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
now the question is all right if I got
 
05:31:41.690 --> 05:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
into my body
 
05:31:44.570 --> 05:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
what we're really waiting for is some
 
05:31:44.580 --> 05:31:46.430 align:start position:0%
what we're really waiting for is some
symptoms

05:31:46.430 --> 05:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
symptoms
 
05:31:48.948 --> 05:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
because if I don't get a tumor right you
 
05:31:50.570 --> 05:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
know I get you know if I don't have any
 
05:31:53.448 --> 05:31:53.458 align:start position:0%
tumors or I don't have any then then how
 
05:31:55.788 --> 05:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
are we you're asymptomatic so what
 
05:31:57.590 --> 05:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
there's no real coverage at that point
 
05:31:59.690 --> 05:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing wrong with you
 
05:32:03.050 --> 05:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
but then once you get some
 
05:32:05.628 --> 05:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
cancer diagnosis
 
05:32:07.730 --> 05:32:07.740 align:start position:0%
whether whatever
 
05:32:11.208 --> 05:32:11.218 align:start position:0%
at that point we don't really we don't
 
05:32:12.890 --> 05:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
really care whether it was pfast it
 
05:32:14.270 --> 05:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
caused it or not at that point we're
 
05:32:16.850 --> 05:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
trying to cure the cancer
 
05:32:19.190 --> 05:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand
 
05:32:21.410 --> 05:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry I walk out of the room
 
05:32:22.788 --> 05:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
and we'll have to talk later we'll tell
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
you that but I'm just you know in my my
 
05:32:26.448 --> 05:32:26.458 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what the purpose of
 
05:32:29.570 --> 05:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
this legislation is is that is that is
 
05:32:33.350 --> 05:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
that some some Physicians
 
05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
using the word pfas in it and then and
 
05:32:37.490 --> 05:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's how it's getting rejected by an
 
05:32:39.770 --> 05:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
uncovered or what what's going on here
 
05:32:42.830 --> 05:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
no I I don't no I don't think that's I
 
05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't think that is happening I don't
 
05:32:46.128 --> 05:32:46.138 align:start position:0%
think Physicians are I
 
05:32:48.110 --> 05:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
I think of anything the Physicians
 
05:32:50.628 --> 05:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
there's probably an opportunity for
 
05:32:53.270 --> 05:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
further education with Physicians
 
05:32:57.590 --> 05:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
um to uh educate them around you know
 
05:33:00.230 --> 05:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
the potential for what exposure might
 
05:33:03.410 --> 05:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
mean for health and and having you know
 
05:33:05.990 --> 05:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
the monitoring uh
 
05:33:09.610 --> 05:33:09.620 align:start position:0%
the monitoring happening okay
 
05:33:13.430 --> 05:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
Mr over here yeah uh to the right to the
 
05:33:13.440 --> 05:33:14.830 align:start position:0%
Mr over here yeah uh to the right to the
right

05:33:14.830 --> 05:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
three in a row on the left over here
 
05:33:20.770 --> 05:33:20.780 align:start position:0%
okay right field
 
05:33:23.960 --> 05:33:23.970 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
05:33:23.970 --> 05:33:28.310 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
[Laughter]

05:33:28.310 --> 05:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:33:29.810 --> 05:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
ladies first
 
05:33:32.410 --> 05:33:32.420 align:start position:0%
I'll see you later
 
05:33:35.448 --> 05:33:35.458 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you
 
05:33:37.970 --> 05:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
um yes uh you mentioned that the
 
05:33:40.910 --> 05:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
insurance companies look at the uh
 
05:33:44.030 --> 05:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
standard for medical necessity
 
05:33:46.788 --> 05:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
um and also that
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
um there was a an issue in the denial of
 
05:33:49.920 --> 05:33:51.350 align:start position:0%
um there was a an issue in the denial of
care

05:33:51.350 --> 05:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:33:53.570 --> 05:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
um in in one of the cases that was that
 
05:33:56.330 --> 05:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
was discussed um an issue of a coding
 
05:34:00.110 --> 05:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
error my question is why isn't it enough
 
05:34:03.170 --> 05:34:03.180 align:start position:0%
that the doctor makes a determination of
 
05:34:06.050 --> 05:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
medical necessity
 
05:34:09.530 --> 05:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
well part of Managed Care in in
 
05:34:11.448 --> 05:34:11.458 align:start position:0%
healthcare is to kind of have those
 
05:34:13.910 --> 05:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
checks and balances with the you know
 
05:34:16.430 --> 05:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
through the insurance company
 
05:34:19.610 --> 05:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
um that is just how Managed Care works
 
05:34:21.230 --> 05:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
but part of it is to look out for
 
05:34:22.788 --> 05:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
patient safety
 
05:34:26.330 --> 05:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
um part of it is to help try to keep uh
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:32.390 --> 05:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative Terry thank you thank you
 
05:34:35.150 --> 05:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm confused again I'm looking at
 
05:34:38.400 --> 05:34:39.410 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm confused again I'm looking at
lines

05:34:39.410 --> 05:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:34:39.420 --> 05:34:39.948 align:start position:0%
lines
um

05:34:39.948 --> 05:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:43.910 --> 05:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
17 and following in the bill proposed
 
05:34:43.920 --> 05:34:45.230 align:start position:0%
17 and following in the bill proposed
bill

05:34:45.230 --> 05:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:34:48.368 --> 05:34:48.378 align:start position:0%
for purposes of this section preventive
 
05:34:52.368 --> 05:34:52.378 align:start position:0%
p f a s p fast care means medical
 
05:34:53.930 --> 05:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
treatment provided in accordance with
 
05:34:55.970 --> 05:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
the CDC and
 
05:34:57.890 --> 05:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
prevention the agency for toxic
 
05:34:59.390 --> 05:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
substances and disease regulatory
 
05:35:01.250 --> 05:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
guidelines for care of an individual
 
05:35:04.070 --> 05:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
with elevated levels all right so
 
05:35:06.890 --> 05:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
do these guidelines
 
05:35:10.430 --> 05:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
actually exist at this time
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of so the bill is
 
05:35:14.690 --> 05:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
calling for
 
05:35:18.250 --> 05:35:18.260 align:start position:0%
a requirement with respect to
 
05:35:23.390 --> 05:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh standards that don't even exist yet
 
05:35:23.400 --> 05:35:25.970 align:start position:0%
uh standards that don't even exist yet
and

05:35:25.970 --> 05:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:35:27.948 --> 05:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
so therefore the second part of my
 
05:35:30.590 --> 05:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
question because of your answer can wait
 
05:35:33.170 --> 05:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
for another time because I was wondering
 
05:35:36.350 --> 05:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
if in fact the standards do exist then
 
05:35:39.288 --> 05:35:39.298 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't there already be care
 
05:35:41.590 --> 05:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
provided why would you be denying care
 
05:35:46.448 --> 05:35:46.458 align:start position:0%
for for very real uh health conditions
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
as a result of whatever it doesn't
 
05:35:51.708 --> 05:35:51.718 align:start position:0%
matter whether they're P fast or or
 
05:35:53.570 --> 05:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
anything else you're you're going to
 
05:35:55.850 --> 05:35:55.860 align:start position:0%
cover health conditions unhealthy health
 
05:35:57.890 --> 05:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
conditions right but you're telling me
 
05:36:00.010 --> 05:36:00.020 align:start position:0%
right now that there there are no
 
05:36:03.170 --> 05:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
guidelines for care that exist at this
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
time as the Bill calls for
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that the report
 
05:36:13.610 --> 05:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
that the national Academy's report
 
05:36:17.448 --> 05:36:17.458 align:start position:0%
makes recommendations to the CDC and the
 
05:36:17.458 --> 05:36:19.090 align:start position:0%
makes recommendations to the CDC and the
atsdr

05:36:19.090 --> 05:36:19.100 align:start position:0%
atsdr
 
05:36:22.670 --> 05:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
but those recommendations have not been
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
vetted or adopted or anything of that
 
05:36:29.390 --> 05:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
nature the the guidelines or guidance if
 
05:36:30.948 --> 05:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
you will for both patients and
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
clinicians that I could find on the CT
 
05:36:36.288 --> 05:36:36.298 align:start position:0%
cdc's website are what I've referenced
 
05:36:38.330 --> 05:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
earlier about you know patients and
 
05:36:40.128 --> 05:36:40.138 align:start position:0%
doctors should have conversations and
 
05:36:41.390 --> 05:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're trying to reduce
 
05:36:44.590 --> 05:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
their exposure and
 
05:36:47.090 --> 05:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
monitoring for symptoms and you know
 
05:36:49.310 --> 05:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
just doing basic standards of care and
 
05:36:51.410 --> 05:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
so all of that
 
05:36:54.770 --> 05:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
it is being covered
 
05:36:57.770 --> 05:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
okay I think you know regardless of the
 
05:37:00.410 --> 05:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
source of whether your symptoms are due
 
05:37:02.330 --> 05:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
to smoking or being overweight or
 
05:37:04.910 --> 05:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
exposure to something
 
05:37:06.530 --> 05:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'd just like to point out
 
05:37:08.208 --> 05:37:08.218 align:start position:0%
to the chair and the remaining members
 
05:37:10.910 --> 05:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee that the EPA has some
 
05:37:12.890 --> 05:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
very very detailed information about a
 
05:37:15.590 --> 05:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
very aggressive process that has been
 
05:37:17.990 --> 05:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
put in place and they have a three-year
 
05:37:21.890 --> 05:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
plan and I would behoove I think all of
 
05:37:24.230 --> 05:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
us who are very very troubled and very
 
05:37:26.330 --> 05:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
frustrated by what we're hearing today
 
05:37:28.610 --> 05:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
and what we heard last year to become
 
05:37:30.708 --> 05:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
better acquainted with what the
 
05:37:33.350 --> 05:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency is is
 
05:37:38.270 --> 05:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:41.150 --> 05:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
the documents or the the things you've
 
05:37:44.270 --> 05:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
been quoting uh for what the CDC
 
05:37:46.788 --> 05:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
guidelines were I found exactly the same
 
05:37:49.128 --> 05:37:49.138 align:start position:0%
thing after looking online for all of
 
05:37:51.410 --> 05:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
three minutes
 
05:37:53.330 --> 05:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative has told us that she has
 
05:37:55.368 --> 05:37:55.378 align:start position:0%
a 300 page document that she's given us
 
05:38:01.250 --> 05:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:03.470 --> 05:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
is that all the ensure I'm trying to
 
05:38:05.810 --> 05:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
form this in a question is that all the
 
05:38:07.250 --> 05:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
insurance company is going to do is
 
05:38:08.628 --> 05:38:08.638 align:start position:0%
spend three minutes looking for some
 
05:38:10.730 --> 05:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
guidelines when in fact there's 300
 
05:38:12.708 --> 05:38:12.718 align:start position:0%
Pages worth of guidelines really out
 
05:38:12.718 --> 05:38:14.330 align:start position:0%
Pages worth of guidelines really out
there

05:38:14.330 --> 05:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:38:17.690 --> 05:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
so again I'm not a medical expert but I
 
05:38:19.128 --> 05:38:19.138 align:start position:0%
do know that the insurance companies
 
05:38:21.650 --> 05:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
have panels of
 
05:38:23.990 --> 05:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
doctors and other experts who are
 
05:38:27.170 --> 05:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
continuously looking at
 
05:38:31.310 --> 05:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
medical evidence standards of care and
 
05:38:31.320 --> 05:38:32.650 align:start position:0%
medical evidence standards of care and
continually

05:38:32.650 --> 05:38:32.660 align:start position:0%
continually
 
05:38:35.170 --> 05:38:35.180 align:start position:0%
updating and
 
05:38:39.110 --> 05:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
updating their coverage accordance you
 
05:38:41.448 --> 05:38:41.458 align:start position:0%
know in accordance with where the where
 
05:38:43.910 --> 05:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
everything is pointing to so
 
05:38:43.920 --> 05:38:45.170 align:start position:0%
everything is pointing to so
um

05:38:45.170 --> 05:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:48.770 --> 05:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
so so I do think that people not me I'm
 
05:38:48.780 --> 05:38:50.150 align:start position:0%
so so I do think that people not me I'm
I'm

05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:38:52.610 --> 05:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
I do government relations I I'm not a
 
05:38:54.830 --> 05:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
medical medical expert but I I do
 
05:38:56.628 --> 05:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
believe that the medical experts at the
 
05:38:57.890 --> 05:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
carrier you're supposed to say I'll get
 
05:39:00.670 --> 05:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
back to you on that one
 
05:39:02.868 --> 05:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
okay I'll be back to you on that one
 
05:39:05.208 --> 05:39:05.218 align:start position:0%
okay representative Herbert
 
05:39:07.310 --> 05:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:39:11.448 --> 05:39:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:13.070 --> 05:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
um and and we have our consumer
 
05:39:16.070 --> 05:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
protection responsibilities here but uh
 
05:39:19.310 --> 05:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
as a legislator I tend to want to see
 
05:39:21.650 --> 05:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
some sort of causal
 
05:39:24.470 --> 05:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
a relationship between
 
05:39:27.050 --> 05:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh you know more than anecdotal and it
 
05:39:28.730 --> 05:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
sounds to me as though
 
05:39:32.448 --> 05:39:32.458 align:start position:0%
there is especially in Merrimack and the
 
05:39:36.350 --> 05:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities which covers
 
05:39:40.310 --> 05:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
35 40 000 people that there is a causal
 
05:39:42.470 --> 05:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
relationship between
 
05:39:45.350 --> 05:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
illnesses and
 
05:39:45.360 --> 05:39:45.948 align:start position:0%
illnesses and
um

05:39:45.948 --> 05:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:48.708 --> 05:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
and and even the corporation itself has
 
05:39:51.230 --> 05:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
done some things in order to try and
 
05:39:55.310 --> 05:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
modify uh the impact but as a legislator
 
05:39:59.050 --> 05:39:59.060 align:start position:0%
to me this is a clear and present danger
 
05:40:02.390 --> 05:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
and and so as as a somebody just
 
05:40:04.788 --> 05:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
supposed to be looking out for the
 
05:40:04.798 --> 05:40:06.770 align:start position:0%
supposed to be looking out for the
consumer

05:40:06.770 --> 05:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
05:40:06.780 --> 05:40:07.690 align:start position:0%
consumer
um

05:40:07.690 --> 05:40:07.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
05:40:13.390 --> 05:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
far beyond far past time to
 
05:40:17.510 --> 05:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
put in a mandate actually because that's
 
05:40:20.270 --> 05:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
it we know we went stop
 
05:40:22.368 --> 05:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
that's a mandate stop it
 
05:40:22.378 --> 05:40:25.010 align:start position:0%
that's a mandate stop it
so

05:40:25.010 --> 05:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:25.020 --> 05:40:26.948 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:40:26.948 --> 05:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:30.350 --> 05:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
when you're having as an insurer
 
05:40:33.410 --> 05:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
at what point do you
 
05:40:36.948 --> 05:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
um determine that uh there's a there's a
 
05:40:38.628 --> 05:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
05:40:42.350 --> 05:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
big enough to you have to uh you have to
 
05:40:46.310 --> 05:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
either ensure or uh
 
05:40:48.170 --> 05:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
go to brownfields and you know on
 
05:40:51.230 --> 05:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy so it's this one sounds to me
 
05:40:54.288 --> 05:40:54.298 align:start position:0%
to be very very dangerous and at at what
 
05:40:57.830 --> 05:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
point is uh the insurance companies
 
05:40:59.810 --> 05:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
trigger where's their trigger where they
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
say oh we have to do something here
 
05:41:03.948 --> 05:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
because theoretically it's it's part of
 
05:41:05.510 --> 05:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
your problem that's what you do for a
 
05:41:05.520 --> 05:41:06.650 align:start position:0%
your problem that's what you do for a
living

05:41:06.650 --> 05:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
living
 
05:41:09.830 --> 05:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
Chris how many mandates how long you've
 
05:41:11.868 --> 05:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
been on this committee now
 
05:41:15.288 --> 05:41:15.298 align:start position:0%
15 mandates ago you're right I mean a
 
05:41:16.850 --> 05:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
lot of the times the mandates you know
 
05:41:18.050 --> 05:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
we've we've gone through this
 
05:41:20.510 --> 05:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
conversation about mandates that well it
 
05:41:23.090 --> 05:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
was about something that was absolutely
 
05:41:25.368 --> 05:41:25.378 align:start position:0%
diagnosable but we've had plenty that we
 
05:41:26.930 --> 05:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
had like pandas that we never could
 
05:41:29.030 --> 05:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
figure out we've we've had ones that are
 
05:41:31.310 --> 05:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
are head scratchers well we've got
 
05:41:33.708 --> 05:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
brownfields remember I understand the
 
05:41:36.530 --> 05:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
1980s and 1970s and I was the Federal
 
05:41:38.510 --> 05:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
Government had to do it
 
05:41:40.850 --> 05:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
we can't afford to do it
 
05:41:43.310 --> 05:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
so representative I believe we can't
 
05:41:44.750 --> 05:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
afford represent posted you have a
 
05:41:44.760 --> 05:41:46.310 align:start position:0%
afford represent posted you have a
question

05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:41:49.250 --> 05:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm not so sure it's a question but
 
05:41:52.128 --> 05:41:52.138 align:start position:0%
um more of a statement or I can't figure
 
05:41:54.230 --> 05:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
out would you believe it would you
 
05:41:57.170 --> 05:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
believe would you believe the Des
 
05:42:00.110 --> 05:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
um uh again in research Recreation and
 
05:42:00.120 --> 05:42:01.610 align:start position:0%
um uh again in research Recreation and
development

05:42:01.610 --> 05:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
development
 
05:42:05.690 --> 05:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
um came to talk to us about pfas and all
 
05:42:08.150 --> 05:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
the different ways that it is entering
 
05:42:11.208 --> 05:42:11.218 align:start position:0%
into Waters Rivers things like that and
 
05:42:14.810 --> 05:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
they are identifying these chemicals by
 
05:42:16.628 --> 05:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
the day
 
05:42:20.448 --> 05:42:20.458 align:start position:0%
and and I would think that it might be
 
05:42:23.810 --> 05:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
beneficial to have them at our meeting
 
05:42:25.610 --> 05:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
because they could probably help us
 
05:42:28.128 --> 05:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
address those because I know they are
 
05:42:31.190 --> 05:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
putting them into categories with the
 
05:42:33.230 --> 05:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
05:42:36.910 --> 05:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:36.920 --> 05:42:38.708 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:42:38.708 --> 05:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:42:42.350 --> 05:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
good question about terminology so the
 
05:42:42.360 --> 05:42:43.850 align:start position:0%
good question about terminology so the
bill

05:42:43.850 --> 05:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:42:46.610 --> 05:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
um covers preventative care which I
 
05:42:48.530 --> 05:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
think could be very frustrating if
 
05:42:52.490 --> 05:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get it up a test to try
 
05:42:55.610 --> 05:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
to prevent a problem before the cancer
 
05:42:57.830 --> 05:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
treatment is covered so I'm trying to
 
05:42:59.750 --> 05:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
understand and I understand there's the
 
05:43:02.270 --> 05:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines are very
 
05:43:02.280 --> 05:43:03.850 align:start position:0%
guidelines are very
um

05:43:03.850 --> 05:43:03.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:07.730 --> 05:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
uh well they're not they're not very
 
05:43:11.208 --> 05:43:11.218 align:start position:0%
specific so what would you interpret as
 
05:43:13.910 --> 05:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
preventative care so that young women
 
05:43:16.610 --> 05:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
that think they have a problem would be
 
05:43:18.470 --> 05:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to have a mammogram for example
 
05:43:20.510 --> 05:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
which I would consider preventative care
 
05:43:20.520 --> 05:43:21.650 align:start position:0%
which I would consider preventative care
right

05:43:21.650 --> 05:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:43:23.510 --> 05:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
right so first of all in the Affordable
 
05:43:26.448 --> 05:43:26.458 align:start position:0%
Care Act in the ACA there
 
05:43:29.208 --> 05:43:29.218 align:start position:0%
preventative care is kind of a a term of
 
05:43:30.948 --> 05:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
art if you will so there are things that
 
05:43:32.570 --> 05:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
are outlined specifically in the
 
05:43:35.448 --> 05:43:35.458 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act in terms of what is
 
05:43:35.458 --> 05:43:36.050 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act in terms of what is
um

05:43:36.050 --> 05:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:39.170 --> 05:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
preventative care that is covered at no
 
05:43:40.730 --> 05:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
cost to the patient so there's there's
 
05:43:43.250 --> 05:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
that type of preventative care
 
05:43:46.490 --> 05:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
um but again I think that you know
 
05:43:48.948 --> 05:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
if if a doctor makes a case that
 
05:43:50.930 --> 05:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
something is medically necessary for a
 
05:43:50.940 --> 05:43:52.430 align:start position:0%
something is medically necessary for a
patient

05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
patient
 
05:43:52.440 --> 05:43:54.708 align:start position:0%
patient
um then

05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
um then
 
05:43:56.330 --> 05:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
then I think there's you know
 
05:44:02.390 --> 05:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:05.810 --> 05:44:05.820 align:start position:0%
yeah all right one more
 
05:44:07.490 --> 05:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:44:09.410 --> 05:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
um if this bill passes
 
05:44:10.850 --> 05:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
how would that affect the insurance
 
05:44:16.850 --> 05:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:18.590 --> 05:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
well it's a it's a good question because
 
05:44:20.090 --> 05:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
I think first of all we're going to have
 
05:44:22.730 --> 05:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
to figure out what the
 
05:44:25.788 --> 05:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
what the standards of care are and I
 
05:44:28.070 --> 05:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
think that's part of what we don't
 
05:44:31.010 --> 05:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
know yet from the CDC
 
05:44:33.350 --> 05:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
um maybe you can get it
 
05:44:36.230 --> 05:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
I I guess I would have to say I I I'm
 
05:44:38.330 --> 05:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
not sure you're all set thank you Heidi
 
05:44:41.090 --> 05:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
so Alex do you want to weigh in at all
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
or you wrote here for for uh for
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
questions but I I get well the question
 
05:44:49.128 --> 05:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
I have is what is preventative care the
 
05:44:51.350 --> 05:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill is preventative care
 
05:44:55.250 --> 05:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
then we don't really have I mean you
 
05:44:57.590 --> 05:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
know in terms like the mandates I mean
 
05:44:59.390 --> 05:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that we don't have deductibles
 
05:45:01.430 --> 05:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
on colonoscopies I guess I don't know if
 
05:45:04.010 --> 05:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
that was never a mandate but I'm trying
 
05:45:06.170 --> 05:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
to think I'm going through my mind all
 
05:45:09.110 --> 05:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
36 mandates that we've seemingly passed
 
05:45:11.090 --> 05:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
while I've been here and I'm trying to
 
05:45:13.190 --> 05:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
remember what you know when what do I
 
05:45:15.770 --> 05:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
compare this to in terms of what what is
 
05:45:18.770 --> 05:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
it that this bill could do yeah I think
 
05:45:21.530 --> 05:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
it would be useful if I just quickly
 
05:45:23.868 --> 05:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
went through the insurance Department's
 
05:45:25.670 --> 05:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
analysis because we were asked to do the
 
05:45:28.368 --> 05:45:28.378 align:start position:0%
fiscal note right now okay cool and
 
05:45:31.670 --> 05:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
overall our impression was that it
 
05:45:35.690 --> 05:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change coverage very much
 
05:45:39.590 --> 05:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
um that uh the preventive care for
 
05:45:41.628 --> 05:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
people who found to have high levels of
 
05:45:45.170 --> 05:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
pfas in their blood would naturally be
 
05:45:48.590 --> 05:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
covered under Wellness visits or lab
 
05:45:52.670 --> 05:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
coverage which is right but part of our
 
05:45:56.208 --> 05:45:56.218 align:start position:0%
reasoning is that um well in our team at
 
05:45:57.650 --> 05:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
the insurance department we have our
 
05:45:59.868 --> 05:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
director of economics who has a PHD in
 
05:46:02.448 --> 05:46:02.458 align:start position:0%
epidemiology and is very familiar with
 
05:46:05.628 --> 05:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
CDC and he took just a few minutes to
 
05:46:08.510 --> 05:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
show me a chart that has very specific
 
05:46:10.730 --> 05:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
treatment recommendations for people who
 
05:46:14.628 --> 05:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
were found to have high levels of pfas
 
05:46:17.150 --> 05:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
in their blood I mean it's very specific
 
05:46:19.970 --> 05:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
it's if you have greater than 20
 
05:46:24.288 --> 05:46:24.298 align:start position:0%
nanograms per milliliter of pfas it
 
05:46:24.298 --> 05:46:25.690 align:start position:0%
nanograms per milliliter of pfas it
recommends

05:46:25.690 --> 05:46:25.700 align:start position:0%
recommends
 
05:46:29.890 --> 05:46:29.900 align:start position:0%
uh screening for dyslipidemia
 
05:46:32.690 --> 05:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
thyroid function testing
 
05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer screening
 
05:46:37.548 --> 05:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
testicular cancer
 
05:46:39.650 --> 05:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
ulcerative colitis and then it has a
 
05:46:42.288 --> 05:46:42.298 align:start position:0%
separate set if you have between 2 and
 
05:46:46.190 --> 05:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
20 nanograms per milliliter so I'm
 
05:46:49.190 --> 05:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
confused because I thought we you know
 
05:46:51.770 --> 05:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
found the cdc's guidelines and that they
 
05:46:53.570 --> 05:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
were very clear and that was our
 
05:46:57.250 --> 05:46:57.260 align:start position:0%
assumption but from the discussion today
 
05:47:00.350 --> 05:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
I'm no longer sure
 
05:47:05.090 --> 05:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
um uh what is the case and if the you
 
05:47:06.708 --> 05:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
know committee would like I could go
 
05:47:09.288 --> 05:47:09.298 align:start position:0%
back and consult with our director of
 
05:47:11.510 --> 05:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
economics and make sure that these are
 
05:47:14.150 --> 05:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
the CDC guidelines and that you know
 
05:47:15.770 --> 05:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
because they seem very clear and well
 
05:47:18.890 --> 05:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
established from what I see and and
 
05:47:20.570 --> 05:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
theoretically those things would have
 
05:47:23.330 --> 05:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
been covered yes anyways in a typical
 
05:47:25.788 --> 05:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
well so this is really I guess it is a
 
05:47:28.128 --> 05:47:28.138 align:start position:0%
an unusual situation in terms of the
 
05:47:31.430 --> 05:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
request of what she wanted to have
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
the procedure and and that in terms of
 
05:47:38.110 --> 05:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
she was doing it for preventative
 
05:47:42.590 --> 05:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
and and wants to and and because she had
 
05:47:44.810 --> 05:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
the high pfas level
 
05:47:47.150 --> 05:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
if the CDC has these scales and with
 
05:47:49.490 --> 05:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
what to be tested for it would have to
 
05:47:52.010 --> 05:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
be on that list right in your mind for
 
05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
us for it to be covered or not yeah yeah
 
05:47:58.970 --> 05:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
so okay so we can go back and look if
 
05:48:01.128 --> 05:48:01.138 align:start position:0%
there's a subcommittee and try to help
 
05:48:04.310 --> 05:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know nail down this issue of you
 
05:48:07.128 --> 05:48:07.138 align:start position:0%
know whether they're established
 
05:48:07.138 --> 05:48:10.030 align:start position:0%
know whether they're established
okay

05:48:10.030 --> 05:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:17.690 --> 05:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:20.030 --> 05:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
don't forget the children I mean adults
 
05:48:21.948 --> 05:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
get free that children are born with
 
05:48:27.410 --> 05:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:30.410 --> 05:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
so Alex would you take a question
 
05:48:32.930 --> 05:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative amen has a question
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming back thank you Mr
 
05:48:35.990 --> 05:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
chair I'm just looking at your fiscal
 
05:48:38.868 --> 05:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
note could you just explain uh
 
05:48:42.170 --> 05:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
the on the on the last page of the bill
 
05:48:44.090 --> 05:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
it says that it would add a health
 
05:48:46.310 --> 05:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
benefit that's above or in addition to
 
05:48:49.250 --> 05:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
the essential health benefits offered in
 
05:48:51.110 --> 05:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
the exchange Marketplace
 
05:48:52.970 --> 05:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
like could you help me understand that
 
05:48:55.430 --> 05:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
oh um
 
05:48:58.850 --> 05:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:00.650 --> 05:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
um condense what we said in our fiscal
 
05:49:02.930 --> 05:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
note basically
 
05:49:05.990 --> 05:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
um we assume that the coverage required
 
05:49:07.548 --> 05:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
in the bill is likely to be something
 
05:49:10.788 --> 05:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
that would already be covered
 
05:49:12.708 --> 05:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
um under the health plans that would be
 
05:49:12.718 --> 05:49:14.208 align:start position:0%
um under the health plans that would be
affected

05:49:14.208 --> 05:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
affected
 
05:49:16.430 --> 05:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and then we
 
05:49:18.890 --> 05:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
hedged our bet and in the fiscal note
 
05:49:20.750 --> 05:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
and said if the bill represents an
 
05:49:23.090 --> 05:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
expansion of coverage then you have the
 
05:49:26.288 --> 05:49:26.298 align:start position:0%
usual concerns about effect on premium
 
05:49:33.470 --> 05:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:35.208 --> 05:49:35.218 align:start position:0%
just just a quick follow-up I'm sorry
 
05:49:36.830 --> 05:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
for the question it sounds like it would
 
05:49:38.990 --> 05:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
create a sort of an uneven playing field
 
05:49:40.368 --> 05:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
am I reading this right where the
 
05:49:42.708 --> 05:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
exchange Marketplace wouldn't have these
 
05:49:44.868 --> 05:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
requirements but private insurers would
 
05:49:46.548 --> 05:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
have this have additional requirements
 
05:49:49.490 --> 05:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
oh I think you're referring to one way
 
05:49:52.390 --> 05:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
of dealing with the defrail problem
 
05:49:55.010 --> 05:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
which is if this committee were to
 
05:49:57.230 --> 05:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
conclude that this you know is mandate
 
05:49:59.390 --> 05:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
that represents an expansion in coverage
 
05:50:01.850 --> 05:50:01.860 align:start position:0%
that would have some cost
 
05:50:01.860 --> 05:50:02.510 align:start position:0%
that would have some cost
um

05:50:02.510 --> 05:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:02.520 --> 05:50:03.770 align:start position:0%
um
uh

05:50:03.770 --> 05:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:50:06.288 --> 05:50:06.298 align:start position:0%
they could pass it but exempt the
 
05:50:09.230 --> 05:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
individual Market from the mandate
 
05:50:11.390 --> 05:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
which we've done in the past yeah we
 
05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
have done that which begs the question
 
05:50:15.948 --> 05:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
is because this was a new mandate with
 
05:50:19.490 --> 05:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
Dad then when it comes to the Medicaid
 
05:50:22.128 --> 05:50:22.138 align:start position:0%
expansion would we then have to pay for
 
05:50:23.810 --> 05:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
the mandate
 
05:50:26.330 --> 05:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
the mandates don't apply to Medicaid
 
05:50:28.910 --> 05:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverages are dictated by no
 
05:50:30.948 --> 05:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
excuse me but there was something under
 
05:50:33.590 --> 05:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
the ACA that any mandates that we passed
 
05:50:35.570 --> 05:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
was that's the individuals that was the
 
05:50:37.128 --> 05:50:37.138 align:start position:0%
individual Market yeah that's the
 
05:50:38.810 --> 05:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
individual I take it back all right that
 
05:50:40.310 --> 05:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
was the individual market so that's one
 
05:50:42.590 --> 05:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
of the reasons we don't pass mandates on
 
05:50:44.868 --> 05:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
the individual Market because we there
 
05:50:46.430 --> 05:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
is a potential it would it will be a
 
05:50:48.650 --> 05:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
cost to us if the person is getting
 
05:50:51.470 --> 05:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
their insurance through the exchange
 
05:50:53.150 --> 05:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
Bingo okay
 
05:50:55.190 --> 05:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much all right I have one
 
05:50:56.810 --> 05:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
card left Sabrina you still want to come
 
05:50:59.590 --> 05:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:03.368 --> 05:51:03.378 align:start position:0%
okay let's have let's hear Anthem story
 
05:51:05.510 --> 05:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
05:51:08.750 --> 05:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
old habits are very hard to break
 
05:51:10.310 --> 05:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the chance to speak I'm
 
05:51:11.930 --> 05:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
Sabrina Dunlap director of government
 
05:51:16.788 --> 05:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:18.830 --> 05:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you chairman hunt and members
 
05:51:20.270 --> 05:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
05:51:22.850 --> 05:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
um we did meet with rep Thomas last week
 
05:51:25.128 --> 05:51:25.138 align:start position:0%
and raised some of our concerns with her
 
05:51:26.990 --> 05:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
and we do have concerns about this bill
 
05:51:29.270 --> 05:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
not because we don't appreciate the
 
05:51:31.190 --> 05:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
importance of the issues but because
 
05:51:33.708 --> 05:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
it's unclear what exactly Insurance
 
05:51:35.930 --> 05:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
could cover in terms of preventative
 
05:51:38.628 --> 05:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
pfas care and
 
05:51:40.310 --> 05:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
um I was talking to our medical director
 
05:51:42.170 --> 05:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
and he described the science and this as
 
05:51:45.530 --> 05:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
a moving Target in terms of causation so
 
05:51:47.690 --> 05:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
he felt this is more of like a public
 
05:51:49.850 --> 05:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
health monitoring issue because it's
 
05:51:52.730 --> 05:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
very unclear what is even meant by
 
05:51:55.208 --> 05:51:55.218 align:start position:0%
preventative pfas care it's undefined
 
05:51:58.010 --> 05:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
and I know the bill refers to CDC and
 
05:52:01.250 --> 05:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
astdr guidance and fact sheets but it's
 
05:52:03.350 --> 05:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
very inconclusive and I won't repeat
 
05:52:03.360 --> 05:52:04.730 align:start position:0%
very inconclusive and I won't repeat
what

05:52:04.730 --> 05:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:52:06.430 --> 05:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
um Heidi right but one of the guidelines
 
05:52:10.250 --> 05:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
they say they point to Providers using
 
05:52:12.410 --> 05:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
their best clinical judgment there's no
 
05:52:14.390 --> 05:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
Clear Connection where it says there's
 
05:52:16.490 --> 05:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
pfas in your blood to therefore do X Y
 
05:52:18.948 --> 05:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
or Z that's our problem with this it's a
 
05:52:20.690 --> 05:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
practical issue
 
05:52:23.090 --> 05:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and so I think
 
05:52:24.890 --> 05:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
it's also important to point out there's
 
05:52:26.990 --> 05:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
a lack of agreement within the medical
 
05:52:29.390 --> 05:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
community and I think in the example
 
05:52:31.670 --> 05:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
that rep Thomas used about the woman
 
05:52:33.650 --> 05:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
with the mammogram I don't know the
 
05:52:35.330 --> 05:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
details but I do wonder if the doctor
 
05:52:37.430 --> 05:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
actually said this is not clinically
 
05:52:38.810 --> 05:52:38.820 align:start position:0%
indicated therefore I'm not going to
 
05:52:40.368 --> 05:52:40.378 align:start position:0%
order it for you that would not be an
 
05:52:41.930 --> 05:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
insurance problem so I don't know if
 
05:52:43.788 --> 05:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
that's the case certainly if a doctor
 
05:52:46.250 --> 05:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
felt that a mammogram was clinically
 
05:52:48.470 --> 05:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
indicated it would be it would be
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
covered doesn't matter if it's cause if
 
05:52:53.510 --> 05:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
pfas is in the mix or not so I think
 
05:52:57.230 --> 05:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
that if you were to ask the provider
 
05:52:58.730 --> 05:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
community in the medical community if
 
05:53:00.890 --> 05:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
there's agreement on what we even mean
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
by some of these terms there wouldn't be
 
05:53:03.120 --> 05:53:04.430 align:start position:0%
by some of these terms there wouldn't be
agreement

05:53:04.430 --> 05:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
05:53:06.530 --> 05:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
um and so I think you know the bottom
 
05:53:07.910 --> 05:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
line is there's not an agreement on the
 
05:53:10.850 --> 05:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
standard of care for pfas and I just
 
05:53:13.970 --> 05:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that clear because it's
 
05:53:16.610 --> 05:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
really kind of a practical issue codes
 
05:53:18.350 --> 05:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
don't exist for this
 
05:53:19.610 --> 05:53:19.620 align:start position:0%
um so I don't even know how you would
 
05:53:21.410 --> 05:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
you would put something under pfas
 
05:53:24.708 --> 05:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:24.718 --> 05:53:26.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:53:26.510 --> 05:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:53:28.490 --> 05:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
all right I think we're all set thank
 
05:53:30.288 --> 05:53:30.298 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you and we'll see
 
05:53:33.288 --> 05:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
you on the first
 
05:53:37.730 --> 05:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:41.770 --> 05:53:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:46.070 --> 05:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
and uh we had one two people for it one
 
05:53:47.990 --> 05:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
person against it
 
05:53:50.990 --> 05:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
all right close the public hearing
 
05:53:53.208 --> 05:53:53.218 align:start position:0%
and get to
 
05:53:54.708 --> 05:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
the one I thought was gonna be the big
 
05:54:15.548 --> 05:54:15.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:19.930 --> 05:54:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:26.390 --> 05:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:26.400 --> 05:54:32.170 align:start position:0%
 
s

05:54:32.170 --> 05:54:32.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:34.850 --> 05:54:34.860 align:start position:0%
scared of all the big guys in uniforms
 
05:54:37.510 --> 05:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
huh scary people yeah
 
05:54:42.128 --> 05:54:42.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:44.930 --> 05:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
the insurance commission really yeah
 
05:54:47.628 --> 05:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
which is a big deal he's gonna he said
 
05:54:50.868 --> 05:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not I'm not supporting a chance
 
05:55:02.830 --> 05:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:06.830 --> 05:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
see I mean
 
05:55:09.708 --> 05:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up the public hearing
 
05:55:12.470 --> 05:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
and hear from the prime sponsor Anita
 
05:55:15.470 --> 05:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
Burroughs and Jerry are you
 
05:55:19.128 --> 05:55:19.138 align:start position:0%
also are you responsible okay
 
05:55:20.930 --> 05:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
is there any Mark that you were for the
 
05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
bill but I assumed that okay good
 
05:55:27.048 --> 05:55:27.058 align:start position:0%
afternoon and sorry we're running so
 
05:55:28.910 --> 05:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
late today

I know it's late so I'm only going to
 
05:55:39.048 --> 05:55:39.058 align:start position:0%
take 45 minutes with my testimony
 
05:55:40.490 --> 05:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
um actually I'm going to be very brief
 
05:55:42.770 --> 05:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
because my smarter half hair is gonna
 
05:55:44.990 --> 05:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's gonna take over after I give my
 
05:55:45.000 --> 05:55:46.490 align:start position:0%
it's gonna take over after I give my
testimony

05:55:46.490 --> 05:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:55:48.650 --> 05:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
um this bill would provide for um to
 
05:55:50.390 --> 05:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
prohibit balance billing for ambulance
 
05:55:50.400 --> 05:55:51.890 align:start position:0%
prohibit balance billing for ambulance
services

05:55:51.890 --> 05:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:55:53.930 --> 05:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
um the bill provides that patients under
 
05:55:56.330 --> 05:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
the Managed Care Act under I'm sorry
 
05:55:58.670 --> 05:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
under managed care plans would require
 
05:56:01.430 --> 05:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
Insurance insurers to reimburse
 
05:56:04.010 --> 05:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers directly and not the
 
05:56:04.020 --> 05:56:04.970 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers directly and not the
patient

05:56:04.970 --> 05:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
patient
 
05:56:07.548 --> 05:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
the bill as it stands now is a case of
 
05:56:10.310 --> 05:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
The Haves and the have-nots
 
05:56:12.650 --> 05:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
ambulance services in urban areas have
 
05:56:14.810 --> 05:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
high baroleum good commercial coverage
 
05:56:17.510 --> 05:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
and low Medicaid reimbursement on the
 
05:56:20.030 --> 05:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
other hand rural areas have low volume
 
05:56:22.310 --> 05:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
High reimbursement from Medicaid and
 
05:56:25.250 --> 05:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
Medicare and low commercial coverage or
 
05:56:27.708 --> 05:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
employer-based insurance plan making it
 
05:56:30.110 --> 05:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
an economically unsustainable model
 
05:56:33.470 --> 05:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
many Urban ambulance services are doing
 
05:56:36.350 --> 05:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
well but many rural ambulance services
 
05:56:37.730 --> 05:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
are failing
 
05:56:40.310 --> 05:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
balance billing hurts consumers who may
 
05:56:42.350 --> 05:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
be hit with a large and unanticipated
 
05:56:44.570 --> 05:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
Bill for ambulance services the
 
05:56:46.548 --> 05:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
insurance company may also pay the
 
05:56:48.048 --> 05:56:48.058 align:start position:0%
consumer for the ambulance services
 
05:56:50.510 --> 05:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
leaving the ambulance service with debt
 
05:56:52.670 --> 05:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
that is unable to collect and I think it
 
05:56:54.230 --> 05:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
might have been in this committee we
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
heard it an instance of a consumer
 
05:56:58.910 --> 05:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
getting a um a check
 
05:57:03.048 --> 05:57:03.058 align:start position:0%
um a good amount for the for the balance
 
05:57:05.570 --> 05:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
billing and um he knew that he shouldn't
 
05:57:07.010 --> 05:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
keep it but he said I had to feed my
 
05:57:09.350 --> 05:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
family so the ambulance service in turn
 
05:57:11.990 --> 05:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
was unable to collect for that for that
 
05:57:12.000 --> 05:57:13.208 align:start position:0%
was unable to collect for that for that
amount

05:57:13.208 --> 05:57:13.218 align:start position:0%
amount
 
05:57:15.650 --> 05:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
municipalities often bear a significant
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
portion of the costs of running an
 
05:57:19.250 --> 05:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
ambulance service through local taxes
 
05:57:22.368 --> 05:57:22.378 align:start position:0%
this bill is just a start IT addresses a
 
05:57:24.590 --> 05:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
minority of patients the majority are
 
05:57:26.208 --> 05:57:26.218 align:start position:0%
covered through large employers who
 
05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
contract with insurance companies most
 
05:57:30.048 --> 05:57:30.058 align:start position:0%
residents in the north do not have
 
05:57:31.490 --> 05:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
access to this type of insurance
 
05:57:33.890 --> 05:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
coverage because we don't have the large
 
05:57:36.288 --> 05:57:36.298 align:start position:0%
large companies that we that other
 
05:57:38.690 --> 05:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
people work for the this will not fix
 
05:57:40.070 --> 05:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
the entire problem of struggling
 
05:57:42.230 --> 05:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
ambulance services other work will be
 
05:57:44.208 --> 05:57:44.218 align:start position:0%
needed to help rural ambulance companies
 
05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
to become sustainable and to provide
 
05:57:48.708 --> 05:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
needed Services the insurance company
 
05:57:50.570 --> 05:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
indicates that this bill would extend
 
05:57:53.270 --> 05:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
consumer protections of people covered
 
05:57:56.030 --> 05:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
by a commercial insurance policy covered
 
05:57:57.948 --> 05:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
by a managed care plan for ambulance
 
05:57:57.958 --> 05:57:59.270 align:start position:0%
by a managed care plan for ambulance
services

05:57:59.270 --> 05:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:58:01.670 --> 05:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
Bill also limits reimbursement for
 
05:58:03.170 --> 05:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
ambulance service to a commercially
 
05:58:05.628 --> 05:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
reasonable value when a dispute cannot
 
05:58:07.368 --> 05:58:07.378 align:start position:0%
be made between an ambulance company and
 
05:58:09.650 --> 05:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
the insurance provider parties may go to
 
05:58:11.750 --> 05:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
the insurance commissioner for a hearing
 
05:58:13.490 --> 05:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
to determine if a fee is commercial
 
05:58:15.650 --> 05:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
reasonable and I'm going to turn this
 
05:58:18.590 --> 05:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:21.048 --> 05:58:21.058 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I'm Jerry Stringham I
 
05:58:22.730 --> 05:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
represent Lincoln and Woodstock in the
 
05:58:25.070 --> 05:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
North country and for the past 25 years
 
05:58:26.930 --> 05:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
I've been a consultant in medical
 
05:58:29.330 --> 05:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
technology with a specialization in
 
05:58:31.610 --> 05:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
healthcare reimbursement
 
05:58:34.010 --> 05:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you representative Burroughs
 
05:58:36.770 --> 05:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
for for bringing this bill back which is
 
05:58:38.510 --> 05:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
kind of a legacy bill that has been
 
05:58:41.810 --> 05:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
going on for for several years here the
 
05:58:44.270 --> 05:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
version that was submitted is as
 
05:58:47.330 --> 05:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
previously presented there's obviously a
 
05:58:49.150 --> 05:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
key need for legislation in this area
 
05:58:51.530 --> 05:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
just by example I recently had a
 
05:58:54.110 --> 05:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
constituent in Florida who needed an
 
05:58:55.868 --> 05:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
ambulance ride for a heart emergency
 
05:58:58.310 --> 05:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
Insurance denied the claim because they
 
05:59:00.770 --> 05:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
stated they had no contract and she was
 
05:59:03.110 --> 05:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
left with over a thousand dollar bill
 
05:59:04.330 --> 05:59:04.340 align:start position:0%
which was
 
05:59:08.030 --> 05:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
quite significant for her but likewise
 
05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
an ambulance in our area took an injured
 
05:59:14.150 --> 05:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
hiker uh 35 miles and what involved a
 
05:59:17.690 --> 05:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
lot of waiting and were paid just a a
 
05:59:20.628 --> 05:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
almost insignificant amount uh by an
 
05:59:22.788 --> 05:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
out-of-state insurer uh with virtually
 
05:59:24.890 --> 05:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
no repercussions neither these
 
05:59:27.708 --> 05:59:27.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances is fair and
 
05:59:30.910 --> 05:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
um uh and we have to do better
 
05:59:32.990 --> 05:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
ensuring Fair payment for the
 
05:59:35.628 --> 05:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
life-saving services provided for
 
05:59:38.628 --> 05:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
patients is critical as well as
 
05:59:40.970 --> 05:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
preventing any surprise and potentially
 
05:59:43.430 --> 05:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
financially devastating ambulance bill
 
05:59:46.548 --> 05:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
it's very laudable goals but since we
 
05:59:47.868 --> 05:59:47.878 align:start position:0%
filed this bill there's some new
 
05:59:50.208 --> 05:59:50.218 align:start position:0%
information that I wanted to share with
 
05:59:52.810 --> 05:59:52.820 align:start position:0%
this committee the federal government
 
05:59:56.690 --> 05:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
recently enacted the no surprises act
 
05:59:59.570 --> 05:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
the no surprises act prohibits balance
 
06:00:02.350 --> 06:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
billing for most Medical Services
 
06:00:06.650 --> 06:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
however they saw to specifically and
 
06:00:09.410 --> 06:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
exclude exclude ground ambulances
 
06:00:12.590 --> 06:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
Services as they're uniquely excluded in
 
06:00:15.070 --> 06:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
part because of the unusual economics
 
06:00:17.690 --> 06:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
secondly they formed a special committee
 
06:00:21.350 --> 06:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
as it was pointed out to me by our chief
 
06:00:23.690 --> 06:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
of our local ambulance services here
 
06:00:27.610 --> 06:00:27.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:31.190 --> 06:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
they have just organized in December of
 
06:00:34.970 --> 06:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
last year and the first meeting was
 
06:00:37.010 --> 06:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
supposed to be last week but postponed
 
06:00:39.590 --> 06:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to be looking at issues
 
06:00:42.650 --> 06:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
of how can they Implement balanced
 
06:00:42.660 --> 06:00:43.570 align:start position:0%
of how can they Implement balanced
billing

06:00:43.570 --> 06:00:43.580 align:start position:0%
billing
 
06:00:47.510 --> 06:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
into Grand ambulances services and still
 
06:00:51.288 --> 06:00:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:54.770 --> 06:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance represents one of I
 
06:00:58.010 --> 06:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
believe 48 Medicare fee schedules uh
 
06:01:00.350 --> 06:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
there is a this is a third Point there's
 
06:01:03.048 --> 06:01:03.058 align:start position:0%
a substantial multi-year project
 
06:01:05.448 --> 06:01:05.458 align:start position:0%
involving surveying all ambulance
 
06:01:06.948 --> 06:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
providers to try to better understand
 
06:01:08.390 --> 06:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
their cost
 
06:01:10.910 --> 06:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's widely recognized at the national
 
06:01:13.070 --> 06:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
level that ambulance services are
 
06:01:17.330 --> 06:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
underfunded and uh and costs are poorly
 
06:01:17.340 --> 06:01:19.090 align:start position:0%
underfunded and uh and costs are poorly
understood

06:01:19.090 --> 06:01:19.100 align:start position:0%
understood
 
06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
fourth as part of the late December
 
06:01:24.948 --> 06:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
legislation passed in Washington you
 
06:01:25.788 --> 06:01:25.798 align:start position:0%
know the
 
06:01:28.310 --> 06:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
what trillion or trillion dollar bill
 
06:01:30.350 --> 06:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
that came through included a temporary
 
06:01:33.110 --> 06:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
boost of about 23 percent for ground
 
06:01:36.948 --> 06:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
ambulance services uh and um was
 
06:01:40.070 --> 06:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
perceived as critical uh to include this
 
06:01:44.690 --> 06:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
to preserve uh rural ambulance services
 
06:01:47.150 --> 06:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
and uh I guess a fifth thing to note is
 
06:01:49.910 --> 06:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
we did have a commercial uh ambulance
 
06:01:51.350 --> 06:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
service provider announced that they
 
06:01:52.548 --> 06:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
would be going out of business in
 
06:01:55.610 --> 06:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
Manchester in the next few weeks
 
06:01:57.770 --> 06:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh there is a critical need to provide
 
06:02:00.850 --> 06:02:00.860 align:start position:0%
balance billing protection for patients
 
06:02:03.770 --> 06:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
perhaps creating a mechanism to
 
06:02:06.770 --> 06:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
challenge unreasonable fees but just as
 
06:02:08.690 --> 06:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
critically protect the economics of our
 
06:02:10.548 --> 06:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
ambulance services
 
06:02:12.470 --> 06:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh the deck is definitely stacked
 
06:02:14.570 --> 06:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
against them in dealing with insurers in
 
06:02:16.610 --> 06:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
rural areas like Lincoln where any skier
 
06:02:19.128 --> 06:02:19.138 align:start position:0%
or hiker or any visitor to our state may
 
06:02:22.610 --> 06:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
end up in our non-profit ambulance we we
 
06:02:25.010 --> 06:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
have just one service that requires a 25
 
06:02:28.690 --> 06:02:28.700 align:start position:0%
mile drive to the nearest hospital
 
06:02:32.690 --> 06:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
and you know without them uh you know we
 
06:02:34.190 --> 06:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
don't have it we don't have much of a
 
06:02:37.128 --> 06:02:37.138 align:start position:0%
town there's no other option so based on
 
06:02:39.610 --> 06:02:39.620 align:start position:0%
our the current status
 
06:02:42.948 --> 06:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
of our rural reimbursements I think it
 
06:02:45.368 --> 06:02:45.378 align:start position:0%
would be critical to
 
06:02:49.128 --> 06:02:49.138 align:start position:0%
exempt the rural ambulance services like
 
06:02:52.310 --> 06:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
like Linwood in any such legislation at
 
06:02:53.448 --> 06:02:53.458 align:start position:0%
this point
 
06:02:55.250 --> 06:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
06:02:55.260 --> 06:02:56.270 align:start position:0%
you know the
um

06:02:56.270 --> 06:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:56.280 --> 06:02:58.548 align:start position:0%
um
uh

06:02:58.548 --> 06:02:58.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:03:01.070 --> 06:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
you know I I support the direction uh
 
06:03:02.750 --> 06:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill is going but I'd also
 
06:03:05.570 --> 06:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
support uh the formation of a committee
 
06:03:07.788 --> 06:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
mimicking the National Ground ambulance
 
06:03:09.350 --> 06:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
committee that I think others here can
 
06:03:10.970 --> 06:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
talk to better than me
 
06:03:13.730 --> 06:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
but at the New Hampshire level
 
06:03:16.548 --> 06:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
uh as our own unique service and
 
06:03:19.310 --> 06:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
character could be incorporated in such
 
06:03:20.930 --> 06:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
a review
 
06:03:23.930 --> 06:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh another another option since the
 
06:03:27.048 --> 06:03:27.058 align:start position:0%
activity is so hard is uh so uh furious
 
06:03:30.048 --> 06:03:30.058 align:start position:0%
at the national level uh is to consider
 
06:03:33.170 --> 06:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
to continue to monitor uh and implement
 
06:03:34.910 --> 06:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
the things that are there
 
06:03:38.208 --> 06:03:38.218 align:start position:0%
I am concerned that balance billing from
 
06:03:40.250 --> 06:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
the federal government is coming
 
06:03:43.190 --> 06:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh and uh there's strong motivation
 
06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
they've done it in most health care
 
06:03:47.750 --> 06:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
services uh ground ambulances have been
 
06:03:51.470 --> 06:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
a uh Exempted so far uh by the skin of
 
06:03:53.230 --> 06:03:53.240 align:start position:0%
the teeth
 
06:03:56.330 --> 06:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage this committee to
 
06:04:01.730 --> 06:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
be diligent so uh that uh you know so
 
06:04:03.590 --> 06:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we have the kind of systems that
 
06:04:05.750 --> 06:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
are he's talked about in this bill to
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
ensure Fair payments to ambulances so we
 
06:04:11.390 --> 06:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
can be sure that our 9-1-1 calls are
 
06:04:15.110 --> 06:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
answered by these able professionals
 
06:04:17.208 --> 06:04:17.218 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
06:04:17.930 --> 06:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:04:17.940 --> 06:04:19.850 align:start position:0%
thank you
[Music]

06:04:19.850 --> 06:04:19.860 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:04:23.030 --> 06:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh I guess we're all set
 
06:04:25.970 --> 06:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:28.250 --> 06:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
I have one more rep mark
 
06:04:30.470 --> 06:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
who has been waiting a long time sorry
 
06:04:30.480 --> 06:04:34.610 align:start position:0%
who has been waiting a long time sorry
Mark

06:04:34.610 --> 06:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:39.590 --> 06:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:41.750 --> 06:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representative Mark Prue
 
06:04:44.810 --> 06:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough 15 Manchester award eight
 
06:04:47.208 --> 06:04:47.218 align:start position:0%
I guess the question is when you dial
 
06:04:49.548 --> 06:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 do you want the ambulance to show
 
06:04:49.558 --> 06:04:50.448 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 do you want the ambulance to show
up

06:04:50.448 --> 06:04:50.458 align:start position:0%
up
 
06:04:52.910 --> 06:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
right in a timely fashion
 
06:04:55.788 --> 06:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
so to do that
 
06:04:57.350 --> 06:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
you have to pay them
 
06:04:59.570 --> 06:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
right because the day of the volunteer
 
06:05:01.310 --> 06:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
is gone
 
06:05:04.250 --> 06:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
right the day of people wanting these
 
06:05:07.368 --> 06:05:07.378 align:start position:0%
jobs is fading unless you pay them
 
06:05:08.810 --> 06:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
06:05:08.820 --> 06:05:10.310 align:start position:0%
a lot
right

06:05:10.310 --> 06:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:05:12.788 --> 06:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
and in this build I saw a commercial
 
06:05:15.708 --> 06:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable
 
06:05:18.350 --> 06:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
who decides that what credentials do
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
they have to decide that so I don't know
 
06:05:23.690 --> 06:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
if you have seen But Maine
 
06:05:27.770 --> 06:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
just kicked out a report uh in December
 
06:05:31.190 --> 06:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
on ambulance and billing
 
06:05:33.770 --> 06:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
and they actually came up with a pretty
 
06:05:36.890 --> 06:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
good cost and I have a handout boy yeah
 
06:05:45.670 --> 06:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:50.650 --> 06:05:50.660 align:start position:0%
and it came up with a cost of a call
 
06:05:54.470 --> 06:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
per call volume
 
06:05:56.628 --> 06:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
in an area where they were running 300
 
06:05:57.890 --> 06:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
calls a year
 
06:06:00.850 --> 06:06:00.860 align:start position:0%
the average call came out to
 
06:06:05.448 --> 06:06:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:08.590 --> 06:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
all the way up to for
 
06:06:13.010 --> 06:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
2100 calls per year to 700
 
06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
and 9.60
 
06:06:16.320 --> 06:06:17.448 align:start position:0%
and 9.60
they're

06:06:17.448 --> 06:06:17.458 align:start position:0%
they're
 
06:06:20.690 --> 06:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
reimbursement was 491
 
06:06:23.390 --> 06:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
dollars and 99 cents
 
06:06:26.030 --> 06:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
leaving quite a bit to be
 
06:06:26.040 --> 06:06:28.490 align:start position:0%
leaving quite a bit to be
absorbed

06:06:28.490 --> 06:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
absorbed
 
06:06:28.500 --> 06:06:31.548 align:start position:0%
absorbed
where

06:06:31.548 --> 06:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:33.350 --> 06:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
not sure whether that money is going to
 
06:06:35.390 --> 06:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
come from to keep that going
 
06:06:38.570 --> 06:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
but you have insurance companies when
 
06:06:40.670 --> 06:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
they receive a bill let's say of a
 
06:06:42.288 --> 06:06:42.298 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
06:06:45.110 --> 06:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
they arbitrarily decide
 
06:06:46.250 --> 06:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
well we're only going to pay four
 
06:06:47.390 --> 06:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
06:06:50.150 --> 06:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
because we have a formula that says
 
06:06:52.250 --> 06:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's what you should be charging
 
06:06:54.590 --> 06:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
we've asked for that information what
 
06:06:56.868 --> 06:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
are you using for a formula and they
 
06:06:58.548 --> 06:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
refuse to give it to us
 
06:07:00.288 --> 06:07:00.298 align:start position:0%
so we don't know how they come up with
 
06:07:02.990 --> 06:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
it magic I guess but I'm not really sure
 
06:07:03.000 --> 06:07:04.730 align:start position:0%
it magic I guess but I'm not really sure
but

06:07:04.730 --> 06:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:07:07.548 --> 06:07:07.558 align:start position:0%
we're only getting a third of the call
 
06:07:11.208 --> 06:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
and don't have any uh
 
06:07:14.090 --> 06:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
easy way to fight that
 
06:07:16.670 --> 06:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
because they have a fleet of lawyers we
 
06:07:16.680 --> 06:07:18.410 align:start position:0%
because they have a fleet of lawyers we
don't

06:07:18.410 --> 06:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:07:18.420 --> 06:07:22.610 align:start position:0%
don't
um

06:07:22.610 --> 06:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:22.620 --> 06:07:24.948 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:07:24.948 --> 06:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:27.230 --> 06:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
you know I look at
 
06:07:30.708 --> 06:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
we build them a thousand they pay us 400
 
06:07:33.110 --> 06:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
my oil company comes gives me a thousand
 
06:07:35.628 --> 06:07:35.638 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of oil and I only want to
 
06:07:37.190 --> 06:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
pay them 400 because I think that's
 
06:07:39.830 --> 06:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable
 
06:07:42.610 --> 06:07:42.620 align:start position:0%
can you guess where I'm going
 
06:07:45.770 --> 06:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
straight to jail right so I'm not really
 
06:07:47.270 --> 06:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
sure how they get to decide what they
 
06:07:49.910 --> 06:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
get to pay and I'm sure there's some
 
06:07:51.230 --> 06:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
loophole for them
 
06:07:54.048 --> 06:07:54.058 align:start position:0%
but a they really need to pay the bill
 
06:07:56.390 --> 06:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
and they need to pay it to the ambulance
 
06:07:58.250 --> 06:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
provider not the patient
 
06:08:00.708 --> 06:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
because like you heard earlier
 
06:08:03.948 --> 06:08:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:05.810 --> 06:08:05.820 align:start position:0%
in my district we actually have somebody
 
06:08:07.910 --> 06:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
a couple people that call once a month
 
06:08:11.990 --> 06:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:15.350 --> 06:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:16.670 --> 06:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
we do have a question Representative
 
06:08:16.680 --> 06:08:17.930 align:start position:0%
we do have a question Representative
Vincent

06:08:17.930 --> 06:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
Vincent
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:08:21.410 --> 06:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:08:23.448 --> 06:08:23.458 align:start position:0%
um being well versed in the medical
 
06:08:26.868 --> 06:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
field uh I served as a firefighter a
 
06:08:29.570 --> 06:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
lieutenant out of Somersworth for 33
 
06:08:32.448 --> 06:08:32.458 align:start position:0%
years and I'm well versed in Medical Aid
 
06:08:35.030 --> 06:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the field itself and I know there's a
 
06:08:37.910 --> 06:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
lot of variables there not only with
 
06:08:40.270 --> 06:08:40.280 align:start position:0%
private service that Somersworth holds
 
06:08:43.548 --> 06:08:43.558 align:start position:0%
but municipality service such as Dover
 
06:08:48.230 --> 06:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
fire and so forth so uh yeah I have to
 
06:08:52.310 --> 06:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
agree with you 100 because of the
 
06:08:55.128 --> 06:08:55.138 align:start position:0%
um complexity of what goes on today so
 
06:08:58.368 --> 06:08:58.378 align:start position:0%
my question to you is this uh yeah how
 
06:09:01.670 --> 06:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
can an insurance provider come up with
 
06:09:04.548 --> 06:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
what you're going to use for services at
 
06:09:07.970 --> 06:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
a scene of a traumatic incident a motor
 
06:09:10.570 --> 06:09:10.580 align:start position:0%
vehicle accident that requires oxygen
 
06:09:14.628 --> 06:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
maybe you had to use a defibrillator and
 
06:09:16.970 --> 06:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
so forth and so forth how do they come
 
06:09:19.070 --> 06:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
up with that right representative that
 
06:09:20.690 --> 06:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
is a very good question
 
06:09:23.150 --> 06:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
and if you ask those people they won't
 
06:09:24.170 --> 06:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
06:09:25.910 --> 06:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
how they come up with how they're going
 
06:09:28.010 --> 06:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
to pay you thank you very much for that
 
06:09:28.020 --> 06:09:31.610 align:start position:0%
to pay you thank you very much for that
answer

06:09:31.610 --> 06:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:34.010 --> 06:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
I have a question representative Exton
 
06:09:34.020 --> 06:09:35.150 align:start position:0%
I have a question representative Exton
so

06:09:35.150 --> 06:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:09:36.708 --> 06:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
this is a would you believe with a
 
06:09:38.270 --> 06:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
question behind it would you believe I'm
 
06:09:39.708 --> 06:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
a select one
 
06:09:41.868 --> 06:09:41.878 align:start position:0%
and I represent the town of Troy and
 
06:09:46.970 --> 06:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
Fitzwilliam here and we recently put our
 
06:09:49.310 --> 06:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
two ambulance services together because
 
06:09:53.330 --> 06:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
as somebody said who wants this job
 
06:09:56.090 --> 06:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
and we're competing with
 
06:09:59.448 --> 06:09:59.458 align:start position:0%
the county no Cheshire County and they
 
06:10:01.910 --> 06:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
can't find anybody who wants the job but
 
06:10:03.650 --> 06:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
the real problem and my question to you
 
06:10:03.660 --> 06:10:05.448 align:start position:0%
the real problem and my question to you
is

06:10:05.448 --> 06:10:05.458 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:10:10.788 --> 06:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
we have we the combined tri-fits William
 
06:10:13.368 --> 06:10:13.378 align:start position:0%
uh Ambulance Service
 
06:10:16.670 --> 06:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
have gotten our collections all the way
 
06:10:19.368 --> 06:10:19.378 align:start position:0%
up to 40 percent of Billings which is an
 
06:10:21.590 --> 06:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
achievement I'm told in this business
 
06:10:23.810 --> 06:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure what business in the
 
06:10:26.390 --> 06:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
planet Works giving 60 percent of your
 
06:10:28.128 --> 06:10:28.138 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream away but
 
06:10:30.890 --> 06:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
are you guys getting more than that have
 
06:10:34.190 --> 06:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
you got some what's your thoughts on I
 
06:10:35.570 --> 06:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
mean it would seem to be as a business
 
06:10:37.070 --> 06:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
person I go well okay I know where I'm
 
06:10:38.150 --> 06:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
going to get the money I'm just going to
 
06:10:39.830 --> 06:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
collect my money but
 
06:10:41.330 --> 06:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
there seem to be a lot of people who
 
06:10:43.208 --> 06:10:43.218 align:start position:0%
feel when they get on the ambulance ride
 
06:10:45.470 --> 06:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
that somebody else was supposed to pay
 
06:10:47.570 --> 06:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
for it which ultimately somebody else
 
06:10:50.868 --> 06:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
does it's the taxpayers right so a
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
little history about me I did 30 years
 
06:10:54.590 --> 06:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
in the city of Nashua retired as a
 
06:10:56.570 --> 06:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
lieutenant I am now a deputy chief in
 
06:11:00.048 --> 06:11:00.058 align:start position:0%
the town of Epping and our collections
 
06:11:01.548 --> 06:11:01.558 align:start position:0%
is a little bit higher than that because
 
06:11:03.650 --> 06:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
we use a really good
 
06:11:06.048 --> 06:11:06.058 align:start position:0%
private company that collects for us I
 
06:11:10.070 --> 06:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:10.080 --> 06:11:13.368 align:start position:0%
 
but

06:11:13.368 --> 06:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:17.208 --> 06:11:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:19.128 --> 06:11:19.138 align:start position:0%
they think their insurance company
 
06:11:21.708 --> 06:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
should be paying the bill
 
06:11:23.750 --> 06:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
right and they actually think it's taken
 
06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
care of hey I submitted the bill to my
 
06:11:27.530 --> 06:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
insurance company I'm all set and then
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
we send them a bill and they're like oh
 
06:11:30.470 --> 06:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
what the heck
 
06:11:33.048 --> 06:11:33.058 align:start position:0%
and I found out that on some occasions
 
06:11:36.170 --> 06:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
not all that if that patient calls their
 
06:11:38.510 --> 06:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
insurance company and says hey
 
06:11:40.610 --> 06:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
what's going on you're supposed to be
 
06:11:42.650 --> 06:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
paying this to oh yeah we'll take care
 
06:11:44.150 --> 06:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
of that now
 
06:11:46.010 --> 06:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
but they have to kind of rattle their
 
06:11:48.708 --> 06:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
cage to get anything out of them and not
 
06:11:48.718 --> 06:11:50.090 align:start position:0%
cage to get anything out of them and not
always

06:11:50.090 --> 06:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
always
 
06:11:53.030 --> 06:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:54.708 --> 06:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
and if they're writing the check to the
 
06:11:54.718 --> 06:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
and if they're writing the check to the
patient

06:11:55.910 --> 06:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
patient
 
06:12:00.590 --> 06:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:02.330 --> 06:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
a whole nother problem
 
06:12:04.128 --> 06:12:04.138 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mark sorry you're

used to be the deputy and DJ now has his
 
06:12:19.010 --> 06:12:19.020 align:start position:0%

together there you get new deputies for
 
06:12:24.230 --> 06:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
the price of one Mr chairman uh I just
 
06:12:25.670 --> 06:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
need to have George Russo's get back
 
06:12:28.190 --> 06:12:28.200 align:start position:0%

06:12:30.470 --> 06:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
and we'll end it here as well thank you
 
06:12:32.990 --> 06:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman for the record my name is DJ
 
06:12:34.610 --> 06:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
Bettencourt I serve as the Deputy
 
06:12:35.810 --> 06:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
06:12:38.510 --> 06:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
insurance department I'm joined by my
 
06:12:41.510 --> 06:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
colleague Alex feldavel and we are here
 
06:12:43.730 --> 06:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
in support this afternoon of this
 
06:12:46.368 --> 06:12:46.378 align:start position:0%
legislation which is rare for the
 
06:12:49.010 --> 06:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
Department to take a position on a piece
 
06:12:51.350 --> 06:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
of legislation that we did not request
 
06:12:53.390 --> 06:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try throughout the course
 
06:12:55.910 --> 06:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
of this testimony to circle around to
 
06:12:57.288 --> 06:12:57.298 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that have been
 
06:12:59.030 --> 06:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
answered I think we can help in some
 
06:12:59.040 --> 06:13:00.048 align:start position:0%
answered I think we can help in some
areas

06:13:00.048 --> 06:13:00.058 align:start position:0%
areas
 
06:13:01.610 --> 06:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
but I'll start by saying that New
 
06:13:04.250 --> 06:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a history and a very good
 
06:13:07.190 --> 06:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
history of addressing balance billing
 
06:13:08.448 --> 06:13:08.458 align:start position:0%
issues and I think that that is
 
06:13:10.010 --> 06:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature can be
 
06:13:11.628 --> 06:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
very very proud of
 
06:13:14.208 --> 06:13:14.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as I said has been at the
 
06:13:16.670 --> 06:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
Forefront of protecting consumers
 
06:13:18.708 --> 06:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
against surprise bills and it started in
 
06:13:22.070 --> 06:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
2018 when governor sununu and the
 
06:13:23.570 --> 06:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
legislature and the insurance department
 
06:13:26.150 --> 06:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
worked together to pass legislation
 
06:13:28.390 --> 06:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
prohibiting out-of-network
 
06:13:30.470 --> 06:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists Pathologists
 
06:13:33.530 --> 06:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
Radiologists in emergency physicians
 
06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
from Surprise billing to commercially
 
06:13:40.070 --> 06:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
insured patients when the care was
 
06:13:42.470 --> 06:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
provided at an in-network facility now
 
06:13:44.448 --> 06:13:44.458 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that that
 
06:13:47.810 --> 06:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
legislation impacted fully insured
 
06:13:47.820 --> 06:13:49.970 align:start position:0%
legislation impacted fully insured
products

06:13:49.970 --> 06:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
products
 
06:13:52.208 --> 06:13:52.218 align:start position:0%
but then in
 
06:13:54.590 --> 06:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
2020 I believe
 
06:13:57.230 --> 06:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
the federal government came along and
 
06:13:59.570 --> 06:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
passed the federal no surprises act and
 
06:14:00.948 --> 06:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
you heard a little bit about that which
 
06:14:03.530 --> 06:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
extended those protections and ended the
 
06:14:05.990 --> 06:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
practice of surprise billing in most
 
06:14:08.628 --> 06:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
other aspects of insurance which
 
06:14:11.628 --> 06:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
included the self-insured market I think
 
06:14:13.250 --> 06:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
it's important to appreciate that the
 
06:14:15.288 --> 06:14:15.298 align:start position:0%
self-insured market represents roughly
 
06:14:18.410 --> 06:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of how people get their care
 
06:14:20.150 --> 06:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
not only here in New Hampshire but
 
06:14:22.010 --> 06:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
06:14:25.490 --> 06:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
the erises yeah
 
06:14:27.230 --> 06:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
so between the state law and the federal
 
06:14:30.170 --> 06:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
no surprises act consumers with either
 
06:14:32.990 --> 06:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
fully or self-insured health plans have
 
06:14:33.000 --> 06:14:34.368 align:start position:0%
fully or self-insured health plans have
protection

06:14:34.368 --> 06:14:34.378 align:start position:0%
protection
 
06:14:36.650 --> 06:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
and that bill at the federal level was
 
06:14:39.170 --> 06:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
sponsored by Senator Hassan was passed
 
06:14:41.090 --> 06:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
with bipartisan support in Congress and
 
06:14:44.030 --> 06:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
was assigned by President Trump so
 
06:14:47.030 --> 06:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a a pretty broad bipartisan
 
06:14:49.250 --> 06:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
support for protecting consumers against
 
06:14:51.830 --> 06:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
surprise medical bills
 
06:14:53.930 --> 06:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
there these are obviously great
 
06:14:55.970 --> 06:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
advancements to protect consumers but
 
06:14:58.670 --> 06:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
there remains one enormous Gap
 
06:15:01.788 --> 06:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
and that is in that both the state and
 
06:15:04.070 --> 06:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
federal law and that is balance billing
 
06:15:06.410 --> 06:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
for ground ambulance
 
06:15:09.830 --> 06:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
a review of complaints revealed that two
 
06:15:12.230 --> 06:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
common scenarios that leave patients in
 
06:15:14.570 --> 06:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
trouble is first a patient gets into an
 
06:15:17.270 --> 06:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
ambulance after a 9-1-1 call and second
 
06:15:19.490 --> 06:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
an ambulance transfers the patient from
 
06:15:21.410 --> 06:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
hospital to hospital
 
06:15:24.708 --> 06:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
in both scenarios patients later learn
 
06:15:27.230 --> 06:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
the fee is much higher because the
 
06:15:29.690 --> 06:15:29.700 align:start position:0%
ambulance was out of network and after
 
06:15:32.030 --> 06:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
the insurer pays what it deems Fair they
 
06:15:35.208 --> 06:15:35.218 align:start position:0%
get a surprise bill for the remainder
 
06:15:37.310 --> 06:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
I asked our consumer division to run
 
06:15:39.230 --> 06:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
some numbers for me
 
06:15:41.270 --> 06:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
as balance billing protections came
 
06:15:44.270 --> 06:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
online in both state and federal law
 
06:15:46.310 --> 06:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
the number of complaints coming into my
 
06:15:50.448 --> 06:15:50.458 align:start position:0%
department evaporated almost entirely
 
06:15:53.810 --> 06:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
however during that same period of time
 
06:15:56.030 --> 06:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
the number of complaints about ambulance
 
06:15:58.850 --> 06:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
balance billing spiked
 
06:16:01.730 --> 06:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
the biggest Spike came last year
 
06:16:04.548 --> 06:16:04.558 align:start position:0%
which fell squarely under the first year
 
06:16:06.830 --> 06:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
of the no surprises act so when both
 
06:16:09.230 --> 06:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
those state and federal protections were
 
06:16:10.910 --> 06:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
in place
 
06:16:13.070 --> 06:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
one patient got a three thousand dollar
 
06:16:15.948 --> 06:16:15.958 align:start position:0%
bill for a Four Mile ride
 
06:16:18.350 --> 06:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
another was charged over eight thousand
 
06:16:19.910 --> 06:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
dollars for a trip from One hospital
 
06:16:22.850 --> 06:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
that could handle his case to another
 
06:16:24.650 --> 06:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
that could
 
06:16:26.628 --> 06:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
we hear from consumers who tell us that
 
06:16:28.670 --> 06:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
had they known they essentially had
 
06:16:30.708 --> 06:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
little to no coverage for ambulance
 
06:16:33.730 --> 06:16:33.740 align:start position:0%
transportation and would be billed
 
06:16:37.070 --> 06:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
they would not have bothered to call the
 
06:16:39.770 --> 06:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
ambulance at all or had someone call an
 
06:16:41.510 --> 06:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
ambulance for them
 
06:16:44.270 --> 06:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
and as I've cited these are not small
 
06:16:44.280 --> 06:16:45.770 align:start position:0%
and as I've cited these are not small
bills

06:16:45.770 --> 06:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:16:49.368 --> 06:16:49.378 align:start position:0%
so this is a pretty scary Prospect when
 
06:16:51.590 --> 06:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
an individual is experiencing a health
 
06:16:53.510 --> 06:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
health crisis the last thing we want
 
06:16:55.850 --> 06:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
them to be worrying about is if they can
 
06:16:57.830 --> 06:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
pay their ambulance bill
 
06:17:01.250 --> 06:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
moreover the decision is almost always
 
06:17:03.470 --> 06:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
out of the hands of the consumer's
 
06:17:03.480 --> 06:17:04.610 align:start position:0%
out of the hands of the consumer's
control

06:17:04.610 --> 06:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
control
 
06:17:06.770 --> 06:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
patients usually choose to go to the
 
06:17:06.780 --> 06:17:07.730 align:start position:0%
patients usually choose to go to the
doctor

06:17:07.730 --> 06:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
06:17:09.708 --> 06:17:09.718 align:start position:0%
but they are vulnerable when they call
 
06:17:13.610 --> 06:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 or get into an ambulance
 
06:17:15.410 --> 06:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
I think we all understand the process
 
06:17:17.510 --> 06:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
the dispatcher picks the ambulance crew
 
06:17:20.270 --> 06:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
which in turn often picks the hospital
 
06:17:22.368 --> 06:17:22.378 align:start position:0%
moreover many ambulances are not
 
06:17:24.830 --> 06:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
summoned by the patients instead the
 
06:17:26.570 --> 06:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
crew arrives at the scene having heard
 
06:17:29.810 --> 06:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
about an accident from somebody else or
 
06:17:31.610 --> 06:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
they've heard about an accident on a
 
06:17:34.430 --> 06:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
scanner or because police or a bystander
 
06:17:36.890 --> 06:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
called 9-1-1
 
06:17:39.048 --> 06:17:39.058 align:start position:0%
the core of the problem is that
 
06:17:41.208 --> 06:17:41.218 align:start position:0%
ambulance and insurance companies often
 
06:17:44.330 --> 06:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
can't agree on a fair price
 
06:17:46.850 --> 06:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
so the ambulance service doesn't join
 
06:17:48.410 --> 06:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
the insurance Network and I'm sure
 
06:17:50.330 --> 06:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear about that in
 
06:17:52.250 --> 06:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
subsequent testimony
 
06:17:54.590 --> 06:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
we acknowledge and appreciate that it is
 
06:17:56.868 --> 06:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
unrealistic to expect EMTs and
 
06:17:58.490 --> 06:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
paramedics at the scene of an emergency
 
06:18:00.830 --> 06:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
to determine whether the company takes a
 
06:18:02.570 --> 06:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
patient's insurance
 
06:18:04.788 --> 06:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that the ambulance service
 
06:18:07.490 --> 06:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
have to charge enough to subsidize the
 
06:18:09.470 --> 06:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
cost of keeping the crew ready
 
06:18:11.208 --> 06:18:11.218 align:start position:0%
in the equipment ready for
 
06:18:13.368 --> 06:18:13.378 align:start position:0%
around-the-clock service even if no
 
06:18:15.288 --> 06:18:15.298 align:start position:0%
calls come in
 
06:18:17.270 --> 06:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that we often hear
 
06:18:19.730 --> 06:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
that sometimes the carriers and the
 
06:18:22.190 --> 06:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance service or municipalities do
 
06:18:25.368 --> 06:18:25.378 align:start position:0%
not even attempt to negotiate a contract
 
06:18:27.410 --> 06:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
and I want to repeat
 
06:18:29.810 --> 06:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
is not the expectation that it is fair
 
06:18:32.510 --> 06:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
for the EMTs to cover the costs on their
 
06:18:35.090 --> 06:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
own rather it is how do we get the two
 
06:18:37.190 --> 06:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
parties together to negotiate a fair
 
06:18:37.200 --> 06:18:39.890 align:start position:0%
parties together to negotiate a fair
rate

06:18:39.890 --> 06:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:42.470 --> 06:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day the problem is
 
06:18:45.230 --> 06:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
is that this current situation leaves
 
06:18:47.690 --> 06:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
patients Stuck in the Middle with
 
06:18:49.368 --> 06:18:49.378 align:start position:0%
out-of-net work charges that are not
 
06:18:49.378 --> 06:18:50.810 align:start position:0%
out-of-net work charges that are not
negotiated

06:18:50.810 --> 06:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
negotiated
 
06:18:52.910 --> 06:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
we believe that this legislation would
 
06:18:52.920 --> 06:18:54.230 align:start position:0%
we believe that this legislation would
incentivize

06:18:54.230 --> 06:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
incentivize
 
06:18:56.930 --> 06:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
those negotiations to take place or at
 
06:18:59.208 --> 06:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
the very least remove the consumer from
 
06:19:01.490 --> 06:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
the dispute and provide the insurance
 
06:19:04.128 --> 06:19:04.138 align:start position:0%
department with the ability to arbitrate
 
06:19:06.650 --> 06:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
a commercially reasonable rate I'll
 
06:19:08.208 --> 06:19:08.218 align:start position:0%
depart for a moment to answer
 
06:19:10.250 --> 06:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
Representatives Vincent's question from
 
06:19:11.868 --> 06:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
from previous
 
06:19:14.590 --> 06:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
so having the insurance commissioner
 
06:19:17.030 --> 06:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
arbitrate a commercially reasonable rate
 
06:19:19.970 --> 06:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
is what currently exists in the state
 
06:19:22.910 --> 06:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
level balance billing provision
 
06:19:26.990 --> 06:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
to date we have had zero
 
06:19:29.510 --> 06:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
requests to have the insurance
 
06:19:32.750 --> 06:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
department arbitrate a commercially
 
06:19:34.190 --> 06:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable rate
 
06:19:36.890 --> 06:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
I would estimate that the very likely
 
06:19:39.470 --> 06:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
reason why is because it is in neither
 
06:19:41.930 --> 06:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
party's interest to have someone else
 
06:19:44.930 --> 06:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
decide what that commercially reasonable
 
06:19:46.610 --> 06:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
rate is
 
06:19:49.190 --> 06:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
because that starts to start that begins
 
06:19:51.890 --> 06:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
to start looking like a fee schedule
 
06:19:55.010 --> 06:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
which I don't think the insurers want so
 
06:19:57.830 --> 06:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
they come to the table and they work and
 
06:19:59.810 --> 06:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
they negotiate with the provider in this
 
06:20:02.208 --> 06:20:02.218 align:start position:0%
case the EMTs to come up with something
 
06:20:04.490 --> 06:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
that is commercially reasonable and that
 
06:20:07.430 --> 06:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
both parties can live with however
 
06:20:10.730 --> 06:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
if the parties were to choose to go the
 
06:20:13.368 --> 06:20:13.378 align:start position:0%
route of having the department arbitrate
 
06:20:16.610 --> 06:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
that we would call both parties in
 
06:20:19.490 --> 06:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
and we would say explain to us why in
 
06:20:22.010 --> 06:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
this situation you feel that what you
 
06:20:24.590 --> 06:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
are looking to provide the provider is
 
06:20:26.990 --> 06:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
is commercially reasonable and provider
 
06:20:29.750 --> 06:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
you tell us why what your billing is
 
06:20:31.368 --> 06:20:31.378 align:start position:0%
what you feel is commercially reasonable
 
06:20:33.650 --> 06:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
and then everybody has to put their
 
06:20:35.390 --> 06:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
cards on the table
 
06:20:37.250 --> 06:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
so again I think for those reasons
 
06:20:40.490 --> 06:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
there's a fairly strong disincentive for
 
06:20:42.890 --> 06:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
the two parties not to negotiate with
 
06:20:45.770 --> 06:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
each other and to resolve the in to
 
06:20:47.690 --> 06:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
resolve the issue before it ever comes
 
06:20:49.310 --> 06:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
to us
 
06:20:51.650 --> 06:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
so whether or not you believe this
 
06:20:53.570 --> 06:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
legislation is the appropriate way to
 
06:20:55.548 --> 06:20:55.558 align:start position:0%
address this problem is a policy
 
06:20:58.310 --> 06:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
decision of course for you to make but
 
06:21:00.048 --> 06:21:00.058 align:start position:0%
we believe that this is an appropriate
 
06:21:04.250 --> 06:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
remedy but what we can say is that the
 
06:21:07.310 --> 06:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
current Dynamic is incredibly unfair to
 
06:21:10.548 --> 06:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
Consumers and it demands reform thank
 
06:21:12.230 --> 06:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
06:21:14.150 --> 06:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and Representative Vincent has
 
06:21:15.650 --> 06:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
a question
 
06:21:17.750 --> 06:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
06:21:20.030 --> 06:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and I'm
 
06:21:22.010 --> 06:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
going to try to find a way to ask a
 
06:21:23.448 --> 06:21:23.458 align:start position:0%
question out of this and I'm hoping that
 
06:21:24.948 --> 06:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
the chairman will have a little latitude
 
06:21:28.190 --> 06:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
with me because on your testimony Sir
 
06:21:30.890 --> 06:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
with all due respect some of the things
 
06:21:34.310 --> 06:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
that you had pointed on are archaic
 
06:21:36.708 --> 06:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
first of all I don't know where you got
 
06:21:38.810 --> 06:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
the test where you came up with the the
 
06:21:41.390 --> 06:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
information that ambulances of following
 
06:21:43.730 --> 06:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
accident scenes that may have happened
 
06:21:46.788 --> 06:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
maybe in the 70s but that don't happen
 
06:21:46.798 --> 06:21:48.230 align:start position:0%
maybe in the 70s but that don't happen
anymore

06:21:48.230 --> 06:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
06:21:50.570 --> 06:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
one other thing I like to point out that
 
06:21:52.070 --> 06:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
you pointed out is you're talking about
 
06:21:56.570 --> 06:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
an eight thousand dollar trance uh a you
 
06:21:58.610 --> 06:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
you've taken a trance uh ported a
 
06:22:02.270 --> 06:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
patient those variables are so widely
 
06:22:04.490 --> 06:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
spread if you're going from Somersworth
 
06:22:06.530 --> 06:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to Mass General and you
 
06:22:08.750 --> 06:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
have to keep a patient alive and you're
 
06:22:11.208 --> 06:22:11.218 align:start position:0%
using multiple people in keeping that
 
06:22:13.670 --> 06:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
patient alive so those would you agree
 
06:22:17.270 --> 06:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
here's my question would you agree that
 
06:22:21.288 --> 06:22:21.298 align:start position:0%
those charges would vary from anywhere
 
06:22:23.750 --> 06:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
between a hundred dollars and you're not
 
06:22:25.250 --> 06:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
going to get a hundred dollars just so
 
06:22:27.948 --> 06:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
we both are clear two eight thousand
 
06:22:30.048 --> 06:22:30.058 align:start position:0%
dollars would you agree with that at all
 
06:22:31.670 --> 06:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
sure so let me answer your first
 
06:22:33.288 --> 06:22:33.298 align:start position:0%
question and then I'll take on your
 
06:22:35.628 --> 06:22:35.638 align:start position:0%
second one all of the examples that I
 
06:22:37.430 --> 06:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
cited in my testimony came from our
 
06:22:40.250 --> 06:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
consumer division so those are real life
 
06:22:42.650 --> 06:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
cases that came to us from residents in
 
06:22:44.208 --> 06:22:44.218 align:start position:0%
the state I didn't make any of these
 
06:22:46.190 --> 06:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
things up and I asked our team to pull
 
06:22:47.750 --> 06:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
them from the last five years so maybe
 
06:22:49.250 --> 06:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
things have changed dramatically over
 
06:22:52.190 --> 06:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
the last five years but these are real
 
06:22:53.930 --> 06:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
stories that came from our consumer
 
06:22:56.030 --> 06:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
division that's number one number two
 
06:22:58.250 --> 06:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
and Alex is going to expand on this a
 
06:23:00.288 --> 06:23:00.298 align:start position:0%
little bit further you all right there
 
06:23:02.448 --> 06:23:02.458 align:start position:0%
are variables in all of those variables
 
06:23:04.430 --> 06:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
would factor into what is a commercially
 
06:23:06.470 --> 06:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable rate for that particular
 
06:23:09.110 --> 06:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
transport and so to your point distance
 
06:23:11.690 --> 06:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
would obviously be one the severity of
 
06:23:14.030 --> 06:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
the care that the patient needed from
 
06:23:16.430 --> 06:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
One hospital to another would play into
 
06:23:18.350 --> 06:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
that and so all of those factors would
 
06:23:20.750 --> 06:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
come together and would need to be if
 
06:23:22.250 --> 06:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
they chose for the Department to
 
06:23:24.470 --> 06:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
arbitrate it those factors would all
 
06:23:26.990 --> 06:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
come in to how our department looked at
 
06:23:29.690 --> 06:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
that case and how we ultimately reached
 
06:23:32.510 --> 06:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
the commercially reasonable rate and let
 
06:23:34.910 --> 06:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
Alex with all due respect I just didn't
 
06:23:36.708 --> 06:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
hear that any testimony the first time
 
06:23:41.650 --> 06:23:41.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:45.590 --> 06:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:48.048 --> 06:23:48.058 align:start position:0%
I would like to mention that the
 
06:23:49.788 --> 06:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
06:23:49.798 --> 06:23:50.390 align:start position:0%
insurance department
um

06:23:50.390 --> 06:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:54.410 --> 06:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
did a study using the claims data about
 
06:23:56.990 --> 06:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
ambulance services a couple of years ago
 
06:23:59.868 --> 06:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
and there were some you know interesting
 
06:24:02.930 --> 06:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
findings that came out of that one is
 
06:24:06.530 --> 06:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
that it's true that roughly uh half of
 
06:24:12.170 --> 06:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
the services are out of network so you
 
06:24:14.090 --> 06:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
know that's why we have the problem that
 
06:24:15.948 --> 06:24:15.958 align:start position:0%
uh balance billing that we have is it's
 
06:24:18.590 --> 06:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
a very high percentage of services that
 
06:24:19.910 --> 06:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
are out of network
 
06:24:23.448 --> 06:24:23.458 align:start position:0%
and uh another interesting finding that
 
06:24:25.610 --> 06:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
I think explains a little bit of why
 
06:24:27.770 --> 06:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
this has been the hardest nut to crack
 
06:24:30.650 --> 06:24:30.660 align:start position:0%
out of all the surprise billing uh
 
06:24:30.660 --> 06:24:31.850 align:start position:0%
out of all the surprise billing uh
contexts

06:24:31.850 --> 06:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
contexts
 
06:24:35.270 --> 06:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
is that there is a great difference a
 
06:24:37.910 --> 06:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
significant difference in the um
 
06:24:39.830 --> 06:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates and the billing
 
06:24:43.730 --> 06:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
rates between public uh or Municipal
 
06:24:47.390 --> 06:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
ambulance services and private and then
 
06:24:47.400 --> 06:24:48.670 align:start position:0%
ambulance services and private and then
private

06:24:48.670 --> 06:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
private
 
06:24:52.610 --> 06:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
Equity owned ambulance services so we
 
06:24:55.368 --> 06:24:55.378 align:start position:0%
found that the private Equity you know
 
06:24:59.510 --> 06:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
we're the highest and the public uh and
 
06:25:01.548 --> 06:25:01.558 align:start position:0%
nonprofit were the lowest and there was
 
06:25:05.208 --> 06:25:05.218 align:start position:0%
a significant difference so
 
06:25:08.390 --> 06:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm not surprised to hear that uh
 
06:25:11.288 --> 06:25:11.298 align:start position:0%
some ambulance services
 
06:25:15.288 --> 06:25:15.298 align:start position:0%
especially rural ones are struggling to
 
06:25:17.208 --> 06:25:17.218 align:start position:0%
make ends meet
 
06:25:17.218 --> 06:25:17.868 align:start position:0%
make ends meet
um

06:25:17.868 --> 06:25:17.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:21.230 --> 06:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
and I also believe that other services
 
06:25:25.190 --> 06:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
are not and that is you know part of the
 
06:25:27.548 --> 06:25:27.558 align:start position:0%
issue there's such irrational
 
06:25:35.890 --> 06:25:35.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:38.330 --> 06:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
representative incident thank you Mr
 
06:25:41.448 --> 06:25:41.458 align:start position:0%
chairman so would you agree today that
 
06:25:44.448 --> 06:25:44.458 align:start position:0%
the Dynamics of our wonderful Medical
 
06:25:47.810 --> 06:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
Aid Services changed meaning
 
06:25:52.250 --> 06:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
from covid to now that uh that the rate
 
06:25:55.128 --> 06:25:55.138 align:start position:0%
of pay has gone up in the incentives
 
06:25:57.650 --> 06:25:57.660 align:start position:0%
that these people have to receive is
 
06:25:59.090 --> 06:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
much greater
 
06:26:01.548 --> 06:26:01.558 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that
 
06:26:04.190 --> 06:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
that they've changed the rate of pay
 
06:26:07.610 --> 06:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
yes and and don't get me wrong I'm not
 
06:26:09.350 --> 06:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
trying to beat your gentleman up here
 
06:26:11.330 --> 06:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to I'm just trying to
 
06:26:13.788 --> 06:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
protect a wonderful service from going
 
06:26:17.510 --> 06:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:19.788 --> 06:26:19.798 align:start position:0%
he had never had so much fun since he
 
06:26:21.650 --> 06:26:21.660 align:start position:0%
was left science and technology and got
 
06:26:24.350 --> 06:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
on this committee see how this committee
 
06:26:25.430 --> 06:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
does Everything You Touch everything
 
06:26:25.440 --> 06:26:28.750 align:start position:0%
does Everything You Touch everything
here

06:26:28.750 --> 06:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:31.788 --> 06:26:31.798 align:start position:0%
we certainly we certainly do not want to
 
06:26:33.350 --> 06:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
see any of these Services go out of
 
06:26:33.360 --> 06:26:34.190 align:start position:0%
see any of these Services go out of
business

06:26:34.190 --> 06:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:26:36.230 --> 06:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
and I I'd like to think that this
 
06:26:37.610 --> 06:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
legislation would help prevent against
 
06:26:41.270 --> 06:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
that because if you are forcing the two
 
06:26:43.910 --> 06:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
parties to come together to negotiate a
 
06:26:45.708 --> 06:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
rate that both parties can live with
 
06:26:48.110 --> 06:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
then you will avoid the situation where
 
06:26:50.570 --> 06:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
you send a patient to collections
 
06:26:52.670 --> 06:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
and ultimately that patient may or may
 
06:26:55.788 --> 06:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
not ever be able to pay that bill and so
 
06:26:58.070 --> 06:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
you're left with that bill at the end of
 
06:27:00.708 --> 06:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
the day when that patient cannot pay it
 
06:27:02.690 --> 06:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having an agreed upon
 
06:27:04.490 --> 06:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
contract where you know what the rate is
 
06:27:06.230 --> 06:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
going to be and you know that the
 
06:27:09.830 --> 06:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:12.890 --> 06:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
great thank you gentlemen thank you
 
06:27:15.530 --> 06:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've gone through all the
 
06:27:17.448 --> 06:27:17.458 align:start position:0%
people who support the bill now we have
 
06:27:20.510 --> 06:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
two who are mixed and that would be the
 
06:27:23.330 --> 06:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and uh so Paula
 
06:27:25.250 --> 06:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
we'll have you go first and because we
 
06:27:27.170 --> 06:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
had Heidi go first the last time so this
 
06:27:27.180 --> 06:27:27.948 align:start position:0%
had Heidi go first the last time so this
time

06:27:27.948 --> 06:27:27.958 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:27:33.590 --> 06:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:35.628 --> 06:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and members of the
 
06:27:37.670 --> 06:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
committee Mr chair my name is Paula
 
06:27:40.730 --> 06:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
Rogers and I'm here on Bob of anthem
 
06:27:40.740 --> 06:27:42.230 align:start position:0%
Rogers and I'm here on Bob of anthem
and

06:27:42.230 --> 06:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:27:44.990 --> 06:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
I come with a lot of
 
06:27:47.150 --> 06:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether I've absorbed all
 
06:27:49.368 --> 06:27:49.378 align:start position:0%
of the ins and outs of the challenge is
 
06:27:51.770 --> 06:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
faced with Contracting with ambulances
 
06:27:54.470 --> 06:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
how they feel how the plans feel how the
 
06:27:56.690 --> 06:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
committee policy committee feels but it
 
06:27:58.670 --> 06:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
is a problem
 
06:28:01.310 --> 06:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
and this Committee in its
 
06:28:04.490 --> 06:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
prior makeup has heard about ambulance
 
06:28:06.830 --> 06:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
since what probably
 
06:28:10.490 --> 06:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
since you were a commissioner
 
06:28:13.368 --> 06:28:13.378 align:start position:0%
so you know I wish I had an answer but
 
06:28:14.990 --> 06:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
all I can say is when I was out in the
 
06:28:16.490 --> 06:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
hall sort of greeting some of my old
 
06:28:19.190 --> 06:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
friends who were getting as gray as I am
 
06:28:21.230 --> 06:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
um I heard that
 
06:28:24.048 --> 06:28:24.058 align:start position:0%
these ambulance companies aren't
 
06:28:26.750 --> 06:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
in contract with most of the carriers in
 
06:28:27.708 --> 06:28:27.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
06:28:30.590 --> 06:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
so we have a serious problem so whatever
 
06:28:32.750 --> 06:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
causes them to do that
 
06:28:35.990 --> 06:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
and us to sort of be locked in at
 
06:28:37.970 --> 06:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
Medicare which I believe is where our
 
06:28:40.310 --> 06:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
Contracting team starts because the
 
06:28:42.530 --> 06:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
understanding is Medicare is fair
 
06:28:42.540 --> 06:28:43.910 align:start position:0%
understanding is Medicare is fair
compensation

06:28:43.910 --> 06:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
06:28:46.490 --> 06:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
and then we go above Medicare now
 
06:28:48.830 --> 06:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're all laughing but Medicare is
 
06:28:50.690 --> 06:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
Medicare and we all know you generally
 
06:28:53.810 --> 06:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
don't argue so um I was talking to one
 
06:28:55.010 --> 06:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
fellow out here who said well today
 
06:28:57.708 --> 06:28:57.718 align:start position:0%
you're below Medicare anthem
 
06:29:00.048 --> 06:29:00.058 align:start position:0%
and I said how can that be
 
06:29:02.510 --> 06:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
and then a few minutes later in a
 
06:29:03.948 --> 06:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
different conversation he said well
 
06:29:06.770 --> 06:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
actually anthem's 10 above Medicare on
 
06:29:08.750 --> 06:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
average so I'm going to have to go back
 
06:29:10.910 --> 06:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
to Med to Anthem and find out exactly
 
06:29:13.010 --> 06:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about but I know one
 
06:29:14.750 --> 06:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
thing we're talking about from anthem's
 
06:29:16.730 --> 06:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
point of view is there's Anthem New
 
06:29:19.310 --> 06:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if you have a contract that
 
06:29:20.570 --> 06:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
was issued in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:29:22.190 --> 06:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
Anthem New Hampshire
 
06:29:24.770 --> 06:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
if you live in New Hampshire but your
 
06:29:26.750 --> 06:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
employer is in Minnesota
 
06:29:29.150 --> 06:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
you may have the Blues in Minnesota as
 
06:29:31.070 --> 06:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
your I'm sure are so it's called a blue
 
06:29:34.490 --> 06:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
card and the blue card sort of folds
 
06:29:37.070 --> 06:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
into the contracts that the domestic
 
06:29:39.110 --> 06:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
company has in a given State and it
 
06:29:41.570 --> 06:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
creates all sorts of billing problems
 
06:29:45.110 --> 06:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
and it's often self-funded and we know
 
06:29:46.548 --> 06:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
now I guess we just heard that
 
06:29:48.470 --> 06:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of you in the state of New
 
06:29:49.730 --> 06:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are either in a government
 
06:29:52.850 --> 06:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
plan self-funded or you know Europe in
 
06:29:54.890 --> 06:29:54.900 align:start position:0%
employment where you are in a
 
06:29:57.170 --> 06:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
self-funded company and so that's out of
 
06:29:59.150 --> 06:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
the realm realm of any domestic
 
06:30:01.788 --> 06:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
company's interest in Contracting but
 
06:30:03.350 --> 06:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's creating these strange things
 
06:30:06.310 --> 06:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
because Anthem may be
 
06:30:09.708 --> 06:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
reimbursing at our rate set sort of what
 
06:30:11.208 --> 06:30:11.218 align:start position:0%
we think is reasonable in the community
 
06:30:13.990 --> 06:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
for an out of network coverage
 
06:30:17.150 --> 06:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
and the company makes the ambulance
 
06:30:19.310 --> 06:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
service May settle for that but I also
 
06:30:22.010 --> 06:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
learned that they may get Bill charges
 
06:30:24.948 --> 06:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
paid by an out of state
 
06:30:27.770 --> 06:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
blue card company so there's there are
 
06:30:30.470 --> 06:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
different there are different receipts
 
06:30:32.448 --> 06:30:32.458 align:start position:0%
depending upon who the insurer is
 
06:30:33.948 --> 06:30:33.958 align:start position:0%
whether it's self-funded whether it's in
 
06:30:35.330 --> 06:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire outside of
 
06:30:36.770 --> 06:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire
 
06:30:38.090 --> 06:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
what is
 
06:30:41.150 --> 06:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely puzzling me is why we cannot
 
06:30:43.670 --> 06:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
get to good contracts I also heard in
 
06:30:45.530 --> 06:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
the hall well why don't we have a
 
06:30:47.690 --> 06:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
network adequacy standard so that any
 
06:30:50.150 --> 06:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
plan writing New Hampshire in writing in
 
06:30:51.830 --> 06:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would have to have
 
06:30:51.840 --> 06:30:53.570 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would have to have
contracted

06:30:53.570 --> 06:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
contracted
 
06:30:57.890 --> 06:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
Network providers we don't have that
 
06:31:00.890 --> 06:31:00.900 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable came up with the
 
06:31:02.690 --> 06:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
Department's presentation about how they
 
06:31:04.310 --> 06:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
would handle commercially reasonable in
 
06:31:06.650 --> 06:31:06.660 align:start position:0%
a dispute situation it's already in New
 
06:31:09.948 --> 06:31:09.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law under the prior surprise
 
06:31:12.048 --> 06:31:12.058 align:start position:0%
billing Provisions that New Hampshire
 
06:31:14.030 --> 06:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
passed to its good credit which is
 
06:31:15.890 --> 06:31:15.900 align:start position:0%
mostly for providers you would bump into
 
06:31:17.868 --> 06:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
in a hospital where you're in network
 
06:31:20.048 --> 06:31:20.058 align:start position:0%
with the hospital but the
 
06:31:22.190 --> 06:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist was out of network and
 
06:31:23.930 --> 06:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
suddenly you get a surprise Bill the
 
06:31:25.128 --> 06:31:25.138 align:start position:0%
standard there is commercially
 
06:31:25.138 --> 06:31:26.448 align:start position:0%
standard there is commercially
reasonable

06:31:26.448 --> 06:31:26.458 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
06:31:28.548 --> 06:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
if you go to network adequacy and say
 
06:31:28.558 --> 06:31:29.390 align:start position:0%
if you go to network adequacy and say
okay

06:31:29.390 --> 06:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:31:31.670 --> 06:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
Anthem signal Harvard whoever you are
 
06:31:34.610 --> 06:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
you have to contract and we can't reach
 
06:31:37.250 --> 06:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
contract and that that is the conundrum
 
06:31:39.708 --> 06:31:39.718 align:start position:0%
because I'm not entirely sure why
 
06:31:42.230 --> 06:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
but of course it's all about money and
 
06:31:45.048 --> 06:31:45.058 align:start position:0%
whether it's whatever it is and laying
 
06:31:47.510 --> 06:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
off costs to a municipality up north
 
06:31:51.830 --> 06:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
that is struggling so if you say network
 
06:31:54.530 --> 06:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
access these standards should be set by
 
06:31:56.150 --> 06:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
a committee
 
06:31:57.948 --> 06:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
you're going to run into the same thing
 
06:31:59.930 --> 06:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
because what's going to happen is we're
 
06:32:01.970 --> 06:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
probably not going to contract and then
 
06:32:03.708 --> 06:32:03.718 align:start position:0%
the standard under the network adequacy
 
06:32:06.048 --> 06:32:06.058 align:start position:0%
law is okay we'll let you continue
 
06:32:08.270 --> 06:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
Anthem Cigna Harvard to sell insurance
 
06:32:10.150 --> 06:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
even though you don't have a network
 
06:32:13.190 --> 06:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
because you weren't able to reach a
 
06:32:14.930 --> 06:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable standard we
 
06:32:16.610 --> 06:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
looked at what you were offering Anthem
 
06:32:18.948 --> 06:32:18.958 align:start position:0%
we thought it was reasonable but you
 
06:32:21.048 --> 06:32:21.058 align:start position:0%
can't get contracts that's not your
 
06:32:22.788 --> 06:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
fault so we would go through this
 
06:32:25.070 --> 06:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
discussion somewhere and so what I'm
 
06:32:28.070 --> 06:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
saying is what the heck is the answer
 
06:32:30.530 --> 06:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
it's late in an afternoon you've heard
 
06:32:33.410 --> 06:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
six bills before this this is the
 
06:32:37.128 --> 06:32:37.138 align:start position:0%
naughtiest I mean k-n-o-t-t-y bill in
 
06:32:39.350 --> 06:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
the afternoon session and I don't know
 
06:32:41.990 --> 06:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
what the answer is all I can say is when
 
06:32:43.910 --> 06:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
I see the fellows behind me many of whom
 
06:32:46.128 --> 06:32:46.138 align:start position:0%
I've seen before I'm happy to see them
 
06:32:48.590 --> 06:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
we all say hello and we go through the
 
06:32:50.390 --> 06:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
same protocol
 
06:32:53.270 --> 06:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
so I hope we could be creative I think
 
06:32:55.850 --> 06:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
parts of this bill do make some sense
 
06:32:57.948 --> 06:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
maybe it would create the dynamic that
 
06:33:00.590 --> 06:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
the two assists Deputy Commissioners
 
06:33:03.110 --> 06:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
advise I don't really know
 
06:33:06.708 --> 06:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
but something has to be done one thing I
 
06:33:09.830 --> 06:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
really supported is and I think I owe it
 
06:33:12.230 --> 06:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
to representative Weston who retired and
 
06:33:14.690 --> 06:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
used to be over here her concern concern
 
06:33:17.448 --> 06:33:17.458 align:start position:0%
was the North Country providers and she
 
06:33:19.730 --> 06:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
put I don't know whether she did it but
 
06:33:21.110 --> 06:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
her friends may have helped her do it
 
06:33:23.510 --> 06:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
put it into the bill that if the
 
06:33:25.250 --> 06:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner were going to be disturbed
 
06:33:27.770 --> 06:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
dealing with a dispute that there could
 
06:33:29.208 --> 06:33:29.218 align:start position:0%
be some
 
06:33:32.090 --> 06:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
Edge to a rural community
 
06:33:33.708 --> 06:33:33.718 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at conversely
 
06:33:35.030 --> 06:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable that you would have to take
 
06:33:37.010 --> 06:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
into consideration the special strains
 
06:33:39.650 --> 06:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
of that we right now have two major
 
06:33:41.330 --> 06:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
companies in New Hampshire where they're
 
06:33:42.948 --> 06:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
major by New Hampshire standards we have
 
06:33:45.590 --> 06:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
Steward ambulance which you see I see it
 
06:33:47.570 --> 06:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
in Concord it was up in the Lakes Region
 
06:33:49.010 --> 06:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
when I first got involved now it's in
 
06:33:50.628 --> 06:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
Concord and probably goes elsewhere I
 
06:33:52.610 --> 06:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
think I saw it going down 93 or whatever
 
06:33:52.620 --> 06:33:54.110 align:start position:0%
think I saw it going down 93 or whatever
and

06:33:54.110 --> 06:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:33:55.610 --> 06:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
um AMR
 
06:33:59.750 --> 06:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
they are very serious
 
06:34:01.910 --> 06:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
issues they're huge companies I'm well
 
06:34:03.650 --> 06:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
respected I'm sure they provide great
 
06:34:06.830 --> 06:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
service but private Equity monies have
 
06:34:09.350 --> 06:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
now found Ambulance Service those along
 
06:34:11.990 --> 06:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
with Dermatology are two big investment
 
06:34:13.750 --> 06:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities in the medical community
 
06:34:17.150 --> 06:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
so what I'm saying is you have a
 
06:34:18.948 --> 06:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
terrible problem I don't know what
 
06:34:20.510 --> 06:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to do I think the
 
06:34:23.208 --> 06:34:23.218 align:start position:0%
Department's bill is reasonable the one
 
06:34:25.610 --> 06:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
part that Anthem doesn't like about it
 
06:34:29.208 --> 06:34:29.218 align:start position:0%
they're taking out the option of so we
 
06:34:31.128 --> 06:34:31.138 align:start position:0%
have a non-contracted provider these
 
06:34:32.930 --> 06:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
gentlemen behind they don't have an
 
06:34:35.030 --> 06:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
Anthem contract one complaint this
 
06:34:36.170 --> 06:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
morning well I don't know what the
 
06:34:38.270 --> 06:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
co-pay is I don't know what the I don't
 
06:34:39.470 --> 06:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
know how to figure out what you know
 
06:34:41.628 --> 06:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
what the consumer has to
 
06:34:44.090 --> 06:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
I don't because I I said well you don't
 
06:34:45.948 --> 06:34:45.958 align:start position:0%
have a contract you can't call provider
 
06:34:48.230 --> 06:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
Solutions you've got a card but how are
 
06:34:49.788 --> 06:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
you going to get to Anthem well then I
 
06:34:51.410 --> 06:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
get well Anthem doesn't answer the phone
 
06:34:53.090 --> 06:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
anyway which could be true on a given
 
06:34:55.070 --> 06:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
day with given the training issues that
 
06:34:57.170 --> 06:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
everybody has
 
06:34:59.030 --> 06:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I've lost my train of thought which
 
06:35:00.288 --> 06:35:00.298 align:start position:0%
is because I'm trying to get a health
 
06:35:01.850 --> 06:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
ahead of myself you're going to tell us
 
06:35:04.850 --> 06:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
what part you don't like about this was
 
06:35:06.830 --> 06:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
given to us what's
 
06:35:10.128 --> 06:35:10.138 align:start position:0%
15 years ago I don't know 12 years ago
 
06:35:13.070 --> 06:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
if you don't contract you send the check
 
06:35:15.590 --> 06:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
Anthem even though you have no contract
 
06:35:17.690 --> 06:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
you either have to send the check to the
 
06:35:17.700 --> 06:35:18.770 align:start position:0%
you either have to send the check to the
member

06:35:18.770 --> 06:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
member
 
06:35:22.610 --> 06:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
or you send it to the provider Anthem
 
06:35:24.470 --> 06:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
has largely chosen to send it to the
 
06:35:28.010 --> 06:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
member I think that problem with that is
 
06:35:29.810 --> 06:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
and I understand that particularly with
 
06:35:32.208 --> 06:35:32.218 align:start position:0%
the economy the way it is member gets
 
06:35:35.510 --> 06:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
the check and it evaporates so that's up
 
06:35:37.190 --> 06:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
to you to decide I'm just telling you
 
06:35:39.288 --> 06:35:39.298 align:start position:0%
that it takes away other leverage
 
06:35:41.448 --> 06:35:41.458 align:start position:0%
because it makes it so much easier for
 
06:35:43.910 --> 06:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
people to stay non-contractable what's
 
06:35:46.190 --> 06:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
it say in the bill no excuse me what's
 
06:35:48.470 --> 06:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
it say in the this bill it's taking away
 
06:35:50.810 --> 06:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
the option of sending it to the member
 
06:35:54.110 --> 06:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
right okay right cool and that's my
 
06:35:57.708 --> 06:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
testimony and I you know I I just would
 
06:35:59.628 --> 06:35:59.638 align:start position:0%
like to see some action on this and I
 
06:36:01.128 --> 06:36:01.138 align:start position:0%
think it's going to take
 
06:36:04.128 --> 06:36:04.138 align:start position:0%
maybe no more commissions or study
 
06:36:06.350 --> 06:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
committees because if you go to them and
 
06:36:08.208 --> 06:36:08.218 align:start position:0%
the same thing gets said and then people
 
06:36:09.590 --> 06:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
sort of throw up their hands and they'll
 
06:36:12.230 --> 06:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
say let's look at it next session is
 
06:36:14.090 --> 06:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
there something that could be done with
 
06:36:16.010 --> 06:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
the Emergency Services folks the
 
06:36:18.650 --> 06:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
insurance department people of Good Will
 
06:36:21.830 --> 06:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
to sit down and figure something out
 
06:36:25.788 --> 06:36:25.798 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony
 
06:36:28.788 --> 06:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you all right
 
06:36:28.798 --> 06:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you all right
Heidi

06:36:35.510 --> 06:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:37.910 --> 06:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
what a day huh don't you just love
 
06:36:42.470 --> 06:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:44.330 --> 06:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
would you love how I schedule these all
 
06:36:44.340 --> 06:36:48.850 align:start position:0%
would you love how I schedule these all
together

06:36:48.850 --> 06:36:48.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:51.350 --> 06:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
06:36:52.788 --> 06:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
again for the record my name is Heidi
 
06:36:54.590 --> 06:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
Kroll I work at Gallagher Callahan and
 
06:36:56.208 --> 06:36:56.218 align:start position:0%
gartrell and I'm here representing ahip
 
06:36:57.650 --> 06:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
which is America's health insurance
 
06:36:59.570 --> 06:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
plans the trade Association for the
 
06:37:01.310 --> 06:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
health insurance carriers
 
06:37:03.170 --> 06:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I have much more to add
 
06:37:05.930 --> 06:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
beyond what um Miss Rogers has shared
 
06:37:07.730 --> 06:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
with you we are in this a hip is in the
 
06:37:11.150 --> 06:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
same position we support the first part
 
06:37:13.070 --> 06:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill in terms of trying to
 
06:37:15.530 --> 06:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
protect consumers from being balanced
 
06:37:15.540 --> 06:37:16.670 align:start position:0%
protect consumers from being balanced
build

06:37:16.670 --> 06:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
build
 
06:37:19.250 --> 06:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
um I I get a lot of emails and one came
 
06:37:21.048 --> 06:37:21.058 align:start position:0%
across my desk the other day and see if
 
06:37:23.150 --> 06:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
I can if I put it in here or not
 
06:37:27.170 --> 06:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
um but anyway something you know like uh
 
06:37:29.750 --> 06:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
over 50 of people get I think balanced
 
06:37:29.760 --> 06:37:30.470 align:start position:0%
over 50 of people get I think balanced
build

06:37:30.470 --> 06:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
build
 
06:37:33.110 --> 06:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
um on on ground ambulance so
 
06:37:33.120 --> 06:37:33.890 align:start position:0%
um on on ground ambulance so
um

06:37:33.890 --> 06:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:35.628 --> 06:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
and you know there's an affordability
 
06:37:38.628 --> 06:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
challenge there for people so we do um
 
06:37:40.310 --> 06:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
support kind of taking the patient out
 
06:37:42.590 --> 06:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
of the mix and protecting them
 
06:37:45.590 --> 06:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
um I agree I've I have not been around
 
06:37:47.030 --> 06:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
um as long as some people in the room
 
06:37:49.610 --> 06:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
but I've been around for many sessions
 
06:37:51.110 --> 06:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
and this is kind of one that keeps
 
06:37:52.310 --> 06:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
coming back and back and it would be
 
06:37:54.530 --> 06:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
nice if we could finally find a solution
 
06:37:55.730 --> 06:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
to it
 
06:37:57.770 --> 06:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
um we do share the concern about
 
06:38:00.770 --> 06:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
striking the language in the second part
 
06:38:02.330 --> 06:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
06:38:02.340 --> 06:38:03.048 align:start position:0%
of the bill
um

06:38:03.048 --> 06:38:03.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:05.628 --> 06:38:05.638 align:start position:0%
about the the checks and really the
 
06:38:08.150 --> 06:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
issue there is that it's the only piece
 
06:38:10.910 --> 06:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
of Leverage that carriers even remotely
 
06:38:13.788 --> 06:38:13.798 align:start position:0%
have to try to get the ambulance
 
06:38:15.470 --> 06:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
providers to come to the table and try
 
06:38:17.270 --> 06:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
to negotiate and actually get them in
 
06:38:19.010 --> 06:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
network because when they are in network
 
06:38:21.948 --> 06:38:21.958 align:start position:0%
the check does go directly to them and
 
06:38:24.650 --> 06:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
only to them and so it was meant it was
 
06:38:26.690 --> 06:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
deliberately it was something that this
 
06:38:29.390 --> 06:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
committee years ago debated I was around
 
06:38:31.368 --> 06:38:31.378 align:start position:0%
for that I was in the room at the time
 
06:38:33.770 --> 06:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
yes and it was a deliberate conscious
 
06:38:37.128 --> 06:38:37.138 align:start position:0%
decision to try to give some leverage to
 
06:38:41.330 --> 06:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
encourage the ambulance providers to to
 
06:38:43.070 --> 06:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
join Networks
 
06:38:45.110 --> 06:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
so be happy to try to answer any
 
06:38:46.730 --> 06:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
questions but I know this is going to
 
06:38:48.490 --> 06:38:48.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and it's okay
 
06:38:50.448 --> 06:38:50.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:38:50.458 --> 06:38:53.090 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

06:38:53.090 --> 06:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:38:55.970 --> 06:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
I'm interested to to find out why it is
 
06:38:58.910 --> 06:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies would
 
06:39:02.330 --> 06:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
um uh want to be able to send the checks
 
06:39:04.070 --> 06:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
to the
 
06:39:07.548 --> 06:39:07.558 align:start position:0%
um uh member and not to the out of
 
06:39:10.850 --> 06:39:10.860 align:start position:0%
network provider I have some personal
 
06:39:13.850 --> 06:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
experience with this unfortunately
 
06:39:17.570 --> 06:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
um having had to write in ambulances in
 
06:39:20.750 --> 06:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
Concord uh where unless something has
 
06:39:23.530 --> 06:39:23.540 align:start position:0%
changed in the last couple of years
 
06:39:27.170 --> 06:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
there has never been a contract between
 
06:39:30.708 --> 06:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
the Concord ambulance provider and uh
 
06:39:32.330 --> 06:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
Anthem Blue Cross
 
06:39:34.430 --> 06:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
06:39:37.850 --> 06:39:37.860 align:start position:0%
I've been told repeatedly that
 
06:39:37.860 --> 06:39:38.628 align:start position:0%
I've been told repeatedly that
um

06:39:38.628 --> 06:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:40.610 --> 06:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
this is because they couldn't I've been
 
06:39:43.010 --> 06:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
told repeatedly by Blue Cross that this
 
06:39:44.570 --> 06:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
was because they could not come to an
 
06:39:44.580 --> 06:39:46.128 align:start position:0%
was because they could not come to an
agreement

06:39:46.128 --> 06:39:46.138 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
06:39:46.138 --> 06:39:47.390 align:start position:0%
agreement
um

06:39:47.390 --> 06:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:50.150 --> 06:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
our I guess my question is
 
06:39:53.750 --> 06:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of how much confusion
 
06:39:56.570 --> 06:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
and complication this
 
06:39:59.330 --> 06:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
method of handling the problem causes
 
06:40:02.150 --> 06:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
for the member who is trying to do the
 
06:40:06.230 --> 06:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
right thing and pay the provider
 
06:40:09.230 --> 06:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
right so again I do support I support
 
06:40:11.930 --> 06:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
the goal of the legislation which is to
 
06:40:14.690 --> 06:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
take the patient out of this the mix and
 
06:40:17.990 --> 06:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
and uh remove the the confusion and the
 
06:40:19.368 --> 06:40:19.378 align:start position:0%
burden for them
 
06:40:21.350 --> 06:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
um I think the reason that the check
 
06:40:23.810 --> 06:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
would go on a I think it could go to the
 
06:40:26.510 --> 06:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
patient or the ambulance provider or I
 
06:40:27.650 --> 06:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
think in some cases it could be
 
06:40:29.628 --> 06:40:29.638 align:start position:0%
addressed to both but the issue is that
 
06:40:31.730 --> 06:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
there is no contract between the carrier
 
06:40:34.430 --> 06:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
and the ambulance provider
 
06:40:36.830 --> 06:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
but that's there is no relationship
 
06:40:39.590 --> 06:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
there it the relationship is between the
 
06:40:41.270 --> 06:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
carrier and the member
 
06:40:41.280 --> 06:40:43.548 align:start position:0%
carrier and the member
so

06:40:43.548 --> 06:40:43.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:40:45.230 --> 06:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
when when the provider when the
 
06:40:47.390 --> 06:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
ambulance provider is out right
 
06:40:49.368 --> 06:40:49.378 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I guess I'll just build on
 
06:40:50.810 --> 06:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
that for everybody so everybody can
 
06:40:50.820 --> 06:40:52.250 align:start position:0%
that for everybody so everybody can
hopefully

06:40:52.250 --> 06:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
06:40:55.610 --> 06:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
uh maybe unbeknownst to you you might
 
06:40:58.548 --> 06:40:58.558 align:start position:0%
hard to believe but when uh you sign up
 
06:41:00.288 --> 06:41:00.298 align:start position:0%
with an insurance company
 
06:41:02.628 --> 06:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
um uh they don't necessarily have
 
06:41:05.208 --> 06:41:05.218 align:start position:0%
contracts with every hospital
 
06:41:07.368 --> 06:41:07.378 align:start position:0%
I remember uh it was a couple years ago
 
06:41:09.288 --> 06:41:09.298 align:start position:0%
that Anthem actually dropped 10
 
06:41:11.868 --> 06:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
hospitals when it came to uh the
 
06:41:13.430 --> 06:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
exchange or in the individual Market
 
06:41:15.890 --> 06:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
when they just did they were not in
 
06:41:19.250 --> 06:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
network uh and so
 
06:41:21.890 --> 06:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
you so we don't we always think that
 
06:41:24.770 --> 06:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
okay but of course my doctor's in the
 
06:41:26.150 --> 06:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
network well
 
06:41:28.490 --> 06:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's in New Hampshire it's very common
 
06:41:28.500 --> 06:41:30.590 align:start position:0%
that's in New Hampshire it's very common
unfortunately

06:41:30.590 --> 06:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
06:41:33.890 --> 06:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
um when it came to ambulances that the
 
06:41:35.930 --> 06:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
insurance companies never made an offer
 
06:41:38.208 --> 06:41:38.218 align:start position:0%
that was worth signing a contract for
 
06:41:41.030 --> 06:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
and it was always too little to it
 
06:41:42.590 --> 06:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't wasn't enough
 
06:41:45.590 --> 06:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
and so the issue was okay well how do we
 
06:41:48.470 --> 06:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
get them to sign the contract and that's
 
06:41:51.410 --> 06:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
where we said well you know and and I'll
 
06:41:53.090 --> 06:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
never forget today when you when we
 
06:41:55.610 --> 06:41:55.620 align:start position:0%
passed the this bill it was that the
 
06:41:57.410 --> 06:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
issue was insurance company well if we
 
06:41:59.208 --> 06:41:59.218 align:start position:0%
don't have a contract with them then how
 
06:42:01.430 --> 06:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
do we know their address how do we know
 
06:42:04.150 --> 06:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
where to send the check to
 
06:42:07.128 --> 06:42:07.138 align:start position:0%
guys okay that that's you know that was
 
06:42:08.868 --> 06:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
the position and they say yeah so we'll
 
06:42:10.788 --> 06:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
send it to the person who you know is
 
06:42:13.250 --> 06:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
the is is the patient
 
06:42:15.770 --> 06:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
and then you would would be responsible
 
06:42:18.048 --> 06:42:18.058 align:start position:0%
to forward that check to ambulance
 
06:42:22.310 --> 06:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:25.190 --> 06:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up inquiry thank you
 
06:42:27.288 --> 06:42:27.298 align:start position:0%
um and thank you yes um I I do
 
06:42:29.868 --> 06:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um and I understand
 
06:42:31.850 --> 06:42:31.860 align:start position:0%
there are complications on the side of
 
06:42:33.830 --> 06:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
the insurance company as well I guess I
 
06:42:35.810 --> 06:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
what I have here is now a would you
 
06:42:35.820 --> 06:42:37.190 align:start position:0%
what I have here is now a would you
believe

06:42:37.190 --> 06:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
believe
 
06:42:40.010 --> 06:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
um which involves my having to have a
 
06:42:42.288 --> 06:42:42.298 align:start position:0%
long conversation with someone at Blue
 
06:42:45.470 --> 06:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
Cross uh which ended with my asking her
 
06:42:48.288 --> 06:42:48.298 align:start position:0%
what she would have done
 
06:42:50.150 --> 06:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
um if she had waked up at three o'clock
 
06:42:53.330 --> 06:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
in the morning in excruciating pain
 
06:42:55.128 --> 06:42:55.138 align:start position:0%
um which turned out to be from a kidney
 
06:42:58.490 --> 06:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
stone uh and she finally agreed that she
 
06:43:00.770 --> 06:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
would have done exactly what I did which
 
06:43:04.670 --> 06:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
was call and call 9-1-1 and get into
 
06:43:07.810 --> 06:43:07.820 align:start position:0%
whatever ambulance arrived
 
06:43:11.390 --> 06:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right so I have a
 
06:43:13.788 --> 06:43:13.798 align:start position:0%
number of cards from all you gentlemen I
 
06:43:16.070 --> 06:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't know the ladies in the bunch but
 
06:43:18.890 --> 06:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
um I I sorted them by I'm doing a little
 
06:43:20.628 --> 06:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
test for myself in New Hampshire so I I
 
06:43:22.910 --> 06:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
went for whoever was the farthest one
 
06:43:26.030 --> 06:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
away so so we'll see how well I do here
 
06:43:28.250 --> 06:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
when I do this uh needless to say we
 
06:43:30.288 --> 06:43:30.298 align:start position:0%
understand I think the committee gets
 
06:43:32.330 --> 06:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
what the problem is
 
06:43:34.010 --> 06:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
um so I'll ask you to be brief please
 
06:43:36.948 --> 06:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
don't repeat yourselves uh but certainly
 
06:43:38.810 --> 06:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
you know you could tell a convincing
 
06:43:41.448 --> 06:43:41.458 align:start position:0%
story to why why
 
06:43:44.030 --> 06:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
um you don't want to lose the balance
 
06:43:46.128 --> 06:43:46.138 align:start position:0%
billing so I'll start out with Nathan
 
06:43:48.288 --> 06:43:48.298 align:start position:0%
Borland because he's in Colebrook and I
 
06:43:50.690 --> 06:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
gotta figure Nathan is the farthest one
 
06:43:50.700 --> 06:43:51.708 align:start position:0%
gotta figure Nathan is the farthest one
away

06:43:51.708 --> 06:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
away
 
06:43:56.570 --> 06:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:59.810 --> 06:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner I appreciate the
 
06:44:01.128 --> 06:44:01.138 align:start position:0%
understanding for the three-hour drive
 
06:44:02.628 --> 06:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
down this morning
 
06:44:05.990 --> 06:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh I spoke to you the last time that
 
06:44:07.970 --> 06:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
this bill was up in 2019 I don't know if
 
06:44:10.128 --> 06:44:10.138 align:start position:0%
you remember me no I remember that I
 
06:44:11.868 --> 06:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
remember faces I don't remember names
 
06:44:14.930 --> 06:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
but at that time I identified myself to
 
06:44:17.090 --> 06:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
you as the elephant in the room because
 
06:44:19.670 --> 06:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
we are the most rural furthest North
 
06:44:21.830 --> 06:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
farthest from anywhere service in the
 
06:44:23.090 --> 06:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
entire state
 
06:44:25.610 --> 06:44:25.620 align:start position:0%
we cover nine percent of the land mass
 
06:44:28.128 --> 06:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
of Northern New Hampshire
 
06:44:31.010 --> 06:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
um so a little bit about our area we
 
06:44:33.770 --> 06:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
have during the week uh the town of
 
06:44:35.330 --> 06:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh has a population of 800
 
06:44:37.548 --> 06:44:37.558 align:start position:0%
people and on the weekend when the
 
06:44:39.830 --> 06:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
snow's out we have 10 000 people in town
 
06:44:42.230 --> 06:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
so we're busy on the weekend and we may
 
06:44:44.628 --> 06:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
not do much at all during the week
 
06:44:46.730 --> 06:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
our coverage area
 
06:44:49.190 --> 06:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
um is a very very depressed economically
 
06:44:52.548 --> 06:44:52.558 align:start position:0%
area there's very little to draw anybody
 
06:44:54.048 --> 06:44:54.058 align:start position:0%
in there so we don't have a lot of
 
06:44:57.470 --> 06:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
resources to draw from at all
 
06:44:59.990 --> 06:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
um our organization we staff one station
 
06:45:02.208 --> 06:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
off of Route 3 just north of Colebrook
 
06:45:05.990 --> 06:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
we cover 57 miles of Route 3 from the
 
06:45:08.930 --> 06:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
Columbia uh Town line all the way up to
 
06:45:10.970 --> 06:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
the Canadian border crossing our
 
06:45:13.670 --> 06:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
response times can be over an hour for a
 
06:45:16.490 --> 06:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 call just getting there
 
06:45:18.830 --> 06:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
not to mention than having to treat the
 
06:45:22.368 --> 06:45:22.378 align:start position:0%
patient and get back to a hospital
 
06:45:24.230 --> 06:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
um we do have the luxury of air support
 
06:45:26.030 --> 06:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
occasionally with dart or Life Flight of
 
06:45:27.470 --> 06:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
Maine if the nine different weather
 
06:45:28.970 --> 06:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
systems between them and us are all
 
06:45:31.128 --> 06:45:31.138 align:start position:0%
cooperating so most of the time we're on
 
06:45:33.470 --> 06:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
our own our next nearest service to back
 
06:45:35.090 --> 06:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
us up would be Grove to the ambulance
 
06:45:39.230 --> 06:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
and they're 35 miles south uh we have a
 
06:45:42.110 --> 06:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
Berlin area there's another paid service
 
06:45:44.448 --> 06:45:44.458 align:start position:0%
that is an hour away or we have new
 
06:45:45.830 --> 06:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
party ambulance over in Vermont and
 
06:45:47.208 --> 06:45:47.218 align:start position:0%
Morgan That's again about an hour
 
06:45:50.090 --> 06:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
response time to us so we are it this is
 
06:45:52.610 --> 06:45:52.620 align:start position:0%
all we have we have four trucks that we
 
06:45:56.090 --> 06:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
staff uh two at 24 hours a day so my
 
06:45:58.128 --> 06:45:58.138 align:start position:0%
labor costs are about a hundred and
 
06:45:59.750 --> 06:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars an hour at this point
 
06:46:02.990 --> 06:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
whether we're on a call or not it's 150
 
06:46:05.270 --> 06:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
an hour to staff we try to put a
 
06:46:07.430 --> 06:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
paramedic and an EMT on every single
 
06:46:09.770 --> 06:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
truck because where we're at
 
06:46:12.470 --> 06:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
we have to if you're out in the middle
 
06:46:14.448 --> 06:46:14.458 align:start position:0%
of the woods and you're in a major
 
06:46:17.150 --> 06:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
snowmobile accident you want the highest
 
06:46:18.890 --> 06:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
level of care there you possibly can the
 
06:46:20.868 --> 06:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
days of us just picking you up throwing
 
06:46:22.010 --> 06:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
in the truck and driving you to the
 
06:46:25.850 --> 06:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
hospital long gone I've spent 23 years
 
06:46:27.650 --> 06:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
educating myself to the point where I'm
 
06:46:30.350 --> 06:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
at now to be able to do this job as has
 
06:46:33.048 --> 06:46:33.058 align:start position:0%
most of my staff
 
06:46:33.058 --> 06:46:33.948 align:start position:0%
most of my staff
um

06:46:33.948 --> 06:46:33.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:35.930 --> 06:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
so the problem is we're driving around
 
06:46:38.030 --> 06:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
in a truck right now that cost us a
 
06:46:39.468 --> 06:46:39.478 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy two thousand dollars
 
06:46:42.110 --> 06:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
in 2017 when we purchased it brand new
 
06:46:45.110 --> 06:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
it has 250 000 miles on it because of
 
06:46:47.150 --> 06:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
where we're located and to replace that
 
06:46:50.208 --> 06:46:50.218 align:start position:0%
truck if I ordered it today I might see
 
06:46:51.830 --> 06:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
it two years from now and it's going to
 
06:46:55.548 --> 06:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
cost me 350 000 to replace it sitting in
 
06:46:57.288 --> 06:46:57.298 align:start position:0%
that truck is a cardiac monitor that I
 
06:46:59.570 --> 06:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
use on almost every single call to do an
 
06:47:01.670 --> 06:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
EKG a blood pressure check your oxygen
 
06:47:04.310 --> 06:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
saturation that monitor is between 35
 
06:47:07.070 --> 06:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
and 50 000 just for that piece of
 
06:47:07.080 --> 06:47:08.510 align:start position:0%
and 50 000 just for that piece of
equipment

06:47:08.510 --> 06:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
06:47:10.730 --> 06:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
and each truck has one so there's you
 
06:47:11.810 --> 06:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
know two hundred thousand dollars worth
 
06:47:13.968 --> 06:47:13.978 align:start position:0%
of equipment sitting inside our million
 
06:47:16.368 --> 06:47:16.378 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of ambulances our
 
06:47:18.410 --> 06:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
ventilators run about fifteen thousand a
 
06:47:21.350 --> 06:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
piece and again Each truck has one
 
06:47:23.810 --> 06:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
um something as simple as an i o needle
 
06:47:25.788 --> 06:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
that is used if we can't get IV access
 
06:47:28.368 --> 06:47:28.378 align:start position:0%
on you because you're in shock and your
 
06:47:30.048 --> 06:47:30.058 align:start position:0%
vasculature has collapsed we actually
 
06:47:32.510 --> 06:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
drill a needle into the bone marrow to
 
06:47:33.650 --> 06:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
be able to get access to get your
 
06:47:36.650 --> 06:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
medicines and fluids and they cost 150 a
 
06:47:36.660 --> 06:47:38.090 align:start position:0%
medicines and fluids and they cost 150 a
piece

06:47:38.090 --> 06:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
piece
 
06:47:40.128 --> 06:47:40.138 align:start position:0%
so I don't have all of last year's
 
06:47:41.990 --> 06:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
numbers because we're in January at this
 
06:47:43.968 --> 06:47:43.978 align:start position:0%
point so I'm going to use 2021 numbers
 
06:47:46.310 --> 06:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
to for you guys to understand the
 
06:47:48.128 --> 06:47:48.138 align:start position:0%
finances that we're dealing with we did
 
06:47:53.208 --> 06:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
875 911 calls that year and 325 of them
 
06:47:55.730 --> 06:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
were what we call no transports we go we
 
06:47:57.890 --> 06:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
evaluate the patient we treat them on
 
06:48:00.590 --> 06:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
scene if that's what's feasible or they
 
06:48:02.510 --> 06:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
decide I really don't want to go to the
 
06:48:04.850 --> 06:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
hospital or it's a fire standby or it's
 
06:48:06.770 --> 06:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
a cardiac arrest where we work on that
 
06:48:09.590 --> 06:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
patient for up to 45 minutes spend a lot
 
06:48:11.628 --> 06:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
of money on equipment and supplies
 
06:48:13.788 --> 06:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
trying to save their life and if we
 
06:48:16.128 --> 06:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
can't and we call it we can't bill for
 
06:48:17.750 --> 06:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't get paid for that at all
 
06:48:19.490 --> 06:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
so we've spent five or six hundred
 
06:48:21.350 --> 06:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
dollars working that cardiac arrest and
 
06:48:23.810 --> 06:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
we don't get paid for it that's built
 
06:48:27.830 --> 06:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
into the cost of the 450 9-1-1 calls
 
06:48:29.390 --> 06:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
that we actually were able to bill for
 
06:48:31.548 --> 06:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
that year
 
06:48:35.150 --> 06:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
um or 550 I apologize to supplement we
 
06:48:36.830 --> 06:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
do inter-facility transports it was
 
06:48:39.230 --> 06:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh by a few people ahead of me
 
06:48:41.270 --> 06:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
where we're taking a patient from One
 
06:48:43.968 --> 06:48:43.978 align:start position:0%
hospital to another uh those are
 
06:48:46.548 --> 06:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
expensive to address uh why the bill
 
06:48:47.930 --> 06:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
might be up to eight thousand dollars
 
06:48:49.250 --> 06:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
for that
 
06:48:50.990 --> 06:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
with the state of our health care System
 
06:48:53.330 --> 06:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
right now I used to go to Dartmouth all
 
06:48:55.730 --> 06:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
of the time now we're going to Hartford
 
06:48:58.430 --> 06:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Albany New York Bay State
 
06:49:00.048 --> 06:49:00.058 align:start position:0%
Medical Center in Springfield Mass
 
06:49:03.230 --> 06:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
Bangor Maine and these are the only beds
 
06:49:05.090 --> 06:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
available for these patients so we're on
 
06:49:06.890 --> 06:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
the road the last one I did to Hartford
 
06:49:08.810 --> 06:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
Connecticut I was on the road 13 hours
 
06:49:11.208 --> 06:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
when I got back to the station I looked
 
06:49:13.310 --> 06:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
and mileage wise if I decided no I'm
 
06:49:15.830 --> 06:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
running away I'd be in Washington DC by
 
06:49:18.350 --> 06:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
that point we've gone that far half of
 
06:49:20.750 --> 06:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
my mileage was unloaded in six hours of
 
06:49:22.310 --> 06:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
my time we didn't have a patient on
 
06:49:23.690 --> 06:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
board so we weren't paid for that time
 
06:49:26.150 --> 06:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
we were only paid for the trip down
 
06:49:28.368 --> 06:49:28.378 align:start position:0%
so you're starting to see why my costs
 
06:49:30.890 --> 06:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
are as high as they are you know in the
 
06:49:32.690 --> 06:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
cities and you were you know your city
 
06:49:34.730 --> 06:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
areas down here where you have AMR or
 
06:49:37.010 --> 06:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
Concord fire their trucks might be on
 
06:49:39.048 --> 06:49:39.058 align:start position:0%
the road for half an hour at a time 45
 
06:49:41.150 --> 06:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
minutes even so they can turn around and
 
06:49:43.430 --> 06:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
do you know up to two or three calls an
 
06:49:45.948 --> 06:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
hour we might do one call that takes us
 
06:49:49.850 --> 06:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
six hours and we so we can send one bill
 
06:49:51.830 --> 06:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the time that other services might be
 
06:49:53.628 --> 06:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
sending out 20.
 
06:49:56.090 --> 06:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
so that addresses you know all of the
 
06:49:57.650 --> 06:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
problems so that you understand why
 
06:50:00.048 --> 06:50:00.058 align:start position:0%
we're our service is probably one of the
 
06:50:01.730 --> 06:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
most expensive in the state
 
06:50:03.530 --> 06:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
we don't want to balance Bill our
 
06:50:05.510 --> 06:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
patients to be very clear none of us
 
06:50:08.030 --> 06:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
none of my peers behind me got into this
 
06:50:10.310 --> 06:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
field to bankrupt people and to get rich
 
06:50:12.350 --> 06:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
we all got in this field because we want
 
06:50:13.610 --> 06:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
to help people
 
06:50:16.368 --> 06:50:16.378 align:start position:0%
absolutely we want to help people I do
 
06:50:18.288 --> 06:50:18.298 align:start position:0%
not like as the chief of our department
 
06:50:20.150 --> 06:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
sending that bill to that patient
 
06:50:22.250 --> 06:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
knowing it's going to be a surprise and
 
06:50:24.948 --> 06:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
they're not expecting and in fact I
 
06:50:26.390 --> 06:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
often tell patients when I'm dropping
 
06:50:28.010 --> 06:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
them off at Dartmouth or wherever I've
 
06:50:31.070 --> 06:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
brought them when you get the bill call
 
06:50:33.650 --> 06:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
me and I'll give them my card because I
 
06:50:35.030 --> 06:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
want to work with these people and
 
06:50:38.090 --> 06:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
explain to them this is you know I
 
06:50:40.010 --> 06:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
understand this is a hardship we don't
 
06:50:41.868 --> 06:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
like to do it but it's necessary right
 
06:50:43.430 --> 06:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
now with the way the system is set up
 
06:50:46.628 --> 06:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
it's stacked against us looking back on
 
06:50:51.530 --> 06:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
2021 numbers we build out 2.4 million in
 
06:50:55.128 --> 06:50:55.138 align:start position:0%
Billing we received in just about a
 
06:50:57.530 --> 06:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars actual cash back out of
 
06:50:59.810 --> 06:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
the 2.4 that we build out so we're right
 
06:51:02.390 --> 06:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
around that 40 mark as well and that's
 
06:51:04.368 --> 06:51:04.378 align:start position:0%
because my hands are tied the insurance
 
06:51:06.890 --> 06:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
company will not negotiate with us here
 
06:51:09.590 --> 06:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
it is take it or leave it one of our
 
06:51:12.170 --> 06:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
local fire chiefs actually just recently
 
06:51:14.090 --> 06:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
he's also on my board of directors has
 
06:51:15.410 --> 06:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
given me permission to talk about his
 
06:51:15.420 --> 06:51:16.448 align:start position:0%
given me permission to talk about his
case

06:51:16.448 --> 06:51:16.458 align:start position:0%
case
 
06:51:19.490 --> 06:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
he had a medical emergency his bill was
 
06:51:21.170 --> 06:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
just shy of 2000 I think it was like
 
06:51:24.288 --> 06:51:24.298 align:start position:0%
eighteen hundred he happens to be an
 
06:51:27.830 --> 06:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
Anthem subscriber I'm sorry Paula
 
06:51:30.708 --> 06:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
um Anthem sent him the statement that
 
06:51:32.810 --> 06:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
hey your explanation of benefits we're
 
06:51:35.510 --> 06:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
going to pay 813 dollars of this 1800
 
06:51:37.730 --> 06:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
claim we think that's a commercially
 
06:51:41.090 --> 06:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
reasonable rate and he's he called them
 
06:51:42.890 --> 06:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
back and said wait a minute I pay you
 
06:51:45.650 --> 06:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
guys 14 or 15 000 a year for my health
 
06:51:47.930 --> 06:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
insurance why are you only paying this
 
06:51:50.690 --> 06:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
amount and they told him the person he
 
06:51:52.610 --> 06:51:52.620 align:start position:0%
spoke with on the phone after four hours
 
06:51:54.590 --> 06:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
of automated operators and trying to
 
06:51:56.990 --> 06:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
reach somebody they said well you can
 
06:51:59.510 --> 06:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
appeal it and we might pay more if you
 
06:52:01.128 --> 06:52:01.138 align:start position:0%
appeal it but if you lose the appeal we
 
06:52:03.410 --> 06:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
pay zero
 
06:52:06.890 --> 06:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
finally lastly addressing why we don't
 
06:52:08.628 --> 06:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
contract with the insurance carriers
 
06:52:11.390 --> 06:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
there may be in-network ambulances in
 
06:52:12.830 --> 06:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
this state if there are I don't know
 
06:52:15.048 --> 06:52:15.058 align:start position:0%
them I don't know who they are nobody
 
06:52:17.208 --> 06:52:17.218 align:start position:0%
that I know is in network because there
 
06:52:20.090 --> 06:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
is absolutely no incentive at all to
 
06:52:22.670 --> 06:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
join that Network my predecessor Bill
 
06:52:25.810 --> 06:52:25.820 align:start position:0%
Watkins who was Chief from 2014 to 2018
 
06:52:29.390 --> 06:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
tried to negotiate with Anthem in 2016.
 
06:52:32.030 --> 06:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
as a commercially acceptable rate after
 
06:52:33.830 --> 06:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
all of the numbers I've just told you it
 
06:52:36.430 --> 06:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
cost us to operate they said
 
06:52:39.590 --> 06:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
672 is a reasonable amount of money
 
06:52:41.690 --> 06:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
to which Bill said I guess we're not
 
06:52:43.310 --> 06:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
signing and that's the last time we've
 
06:52:45.590 --> 06:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
tried to negotiate because they won't
 
06:52:47.930 --> 06:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
negotiate they treat us with the same
 
06:52:50.090 --> 06:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
with our call volumes and our expenses
 
06:52:52.548 --> 06:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
like they'd treat you know Services down
 
06:52:54.410 --> 06:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
further south that don't have the
 
06:52:57.170 --> 06:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:58.968 --> 06:52:58.978 align:start position:0%
I think I've pretty much talked myself
 
06:53:00.948 --> 06:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
out of everything here so if you have
 
06:53:02.330 --> 06:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
any questions I'll certainly try to
 
06:53:06.910 --> 06:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:09.468 --> 06:53:09.478 align:start position:0%
I think they get it
 
06:53:11.930 --> 06:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for your safe
 
06:53:14.150 --> 06:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
drive home
 
06:53:17.570 --> 06:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
okay next one is North Woodstock uh
 
06:53:30.468 --> 06:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:33.350 --> 06:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:35.930 --> 06:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for spending all this time and
 
06:53:38.510 --> 06:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
listening to us I think director Borland
 
06:53:40.610 --> 06:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
hit pretty much all of it right on the
 
06:53:43.010 --> 06:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
head so I won't repeat it I'm the chief
 
06:53:47.208 --> 06:53:47.218 align:start position:0%
of the uh non-profit 9-1-1 service that
 
06:53:50.510 --> 06:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
covers the town of Woodstock in Lincoln
 
06:53:52.250 --> 06:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
um we're in a similar situation to Chief
 
06:53:54.650 --> 06:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
Borland and that our nearest hospitals
 
06:53:57.650 --> 06:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
are 30 miles away we have no other
 
06:54:00.430 --> 06:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
choices nothing closer
 
06:54:04.190 --> 06:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
and we are also at about 40 percent we
 
06:54:05.628 --> 06:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
have tried to negotiate with the
 
06:54:08.330 --> 06:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to be in network and
 
06:54:09.708 --> 06:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth and they essentially
 
06:54:11.810 --> 06:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
say the same thing take it or leave it
 
06:54:15.048 --> 06:54:15.058 align:start position:0%
for something that is about roughly a
 
06:54:17.510 --> 06:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
third of what it actually costs us to
 
06:54:19.270 --> 06:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
run the service
 
06:54:23.570 --> 06:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
we have great concerns that we don't we
 
06:54:25.310 --> 06:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
think that patients should be protected
 
06:54:27.350 --> 06:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of the bill is is great
 
06:54:31.128 --> 06:54:31.138 align:start position:0%
however to shift all of the
 
06:54:32.810 --> 06:54:32.820 align:start position:0%
um authority over to the insurance
 
06:54:34.850 --> 06:54:34.860 align:start position:0%
commissioner leaves us a little bit of a
 
06:54:37.128 --> 06:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
problem because as you heard from the
 
06:54:38.930 --> 06:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
insurance company and as the
 
06:54:40.548 --> 06:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
representative over here pointed out
 
06:54:42.650 --> 06:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with information that's
 
06:54:45.230 --> 06:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
at least 10 years out of date in terms
 
06:54:46.730 --> 06:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
of what's legal in the state of New
 
06:54:48.890 --> 06:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire he cited several suggestions
 
06:54:50.570 --> 06:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
that just are not legal we would lose
 
06:54:54.010 --> 06:54:54.020 align:start position:0%
our licenses if we did what he suggested
 
06:54:56.810 --> 06:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
so to put all of the authority over on
 
06:54:58.430 --> 06:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
the insurance commissioner as a sole
 
06:55:01.250 --> 06:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
arbitrator is not very helpful at all
 
06:55:03.410 --> 06:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
and it will hurt Emergency Medical
 
06:55:06.230 --> 06:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
Services that are already struggling we
 
06:55:08.330 --> 06:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
have a three-town area immediately to
 
06:55:10.910 --> 06:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
the north of us that as of Tuesday has
 
06:55:14.150 --> 06:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
no EMS and no ambulance available to us
 
06:55:15.770 --> 06:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a house of cards
 
06:55:17.690 --> 06:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
that's Fallen quickly because of the
 
06:55:20.390 --> 06:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates which are basically
 
06:55:22.430 --> 06:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
a quarter of what it's costing us to
 
06:55:25.490 --> 06:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
provide the services as uh as director
 
06:55:29.810 --> 06:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:32.750 --> 06:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
so I you know uh I'm thinking I should
 
06:55:33.770 --> 06:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
ask this question
 
06:55:37.270 --> 06:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
um how much does the Two Towns pay
 
06:55:41.510 --> 06:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
Two Towns do subsidize us a bit for the
 
06:55:45.170 --> 06:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
911 calls but as Nate just suggested
 
06:55:47.810 --> 06:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
about half of our 911 calls are no
 
06:55:49.788 --> 06:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
transports which means they're not
 
06:55:52.368 --> 06:55:52.378 align:start position:0%
billable in the first place so we will
 
06:55:55.310 --> 06:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
go to a cardiac arrest call and empty
 
06:55:57.230 --> 06:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
everything on the ambulance into this
 
06:55:59.570 --> 06:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
patient in an effort a valiant effort to
 
06:56:01.010 --> 06:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
save them
 
06:56:03.110 --> 06:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
um in the crew time and the Personnel
 
06:56:05.030 --> 06:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
time and all the Expendable equipment
 
06:56:07.368 --> 06:56:07.378 align:start position:0%
and we cannot bill for that we cannot
 
06:56:09.650 --> 06:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
collect dissent we have other calls
 
06:56:11.090 --> 06:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
where we get called to motor vehicle
 
06:56:13.190 --> 06:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
accidents to check out a patient's
 
06:56:15.610 --> 06:56:15.620 align:start position:0%
ouches and and and so on and so forth
 
06:56:18.890 --> 06:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
and find that they are fit to travel by
 
06:56:20.510 --> 06:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
their own private car
 
06:56:24.288 --> 06:56:24.298 align:start position:0%
uh to a hospital and they do that and
 
06:56:26.090 --> 06:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
again our time and effort on that call
 
06:56:28.850 --> 06:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
is not reimbursed whatsoever and on a
 
06:56:31.190 --> 06:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 service that's about 50 of our
 
06:56:31.200 --> 06:56:35.090 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 service that's about 50 of our
calls

06:56:35.090 --> 06:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:38.810 --> 06:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:41.150 --> 06:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:56:43.310 --> 06:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
I guess we're all set enjoy your drive
 
06:56:45.830 --> 06:56:45.840 align:start position:0%

okay uh Derek arms I thought it was
 
06:56:56.030 --> 06:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hobart Hubbard Hubert is that where you
 
06:57:03.048 --> 06:57:03.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:06.110 --> 06:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
Oh that's oh man

06:57:10.510 --> 06:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:13.430 --> 06:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
you got me on that one I'm actually
 
06:57:15.048 --> 06:57:15.058 align:start position:0%
representing New London and uh my name
 
06:57:16.490 --> 06:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
is Derek almond I'm the director of the
 
06:57:18.530 --> 06:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
New London England okay um I'm not going
 
06:57:20.030 --> 06:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
to spend a lot of time because
 
06:57:22.368 --> 06:57:22.378 align:start position:0%
um to both Chief and uh Nate's points um
 
06:57:25.070 --> 06:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
well covered I will say that um you know
 
06:57:26.750 --> 06:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I think is a very
 
06:57:28.610 --> 06:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
real reality that you need to consider
 
06:57:30.890 --> 06:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
is that someday you dial 9-1-1 you
 
06:57:32.448 --> 06:57:32.458 align:start position:0%
expect an ambulance to come and it
 
06:57:36.190 --> 06:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't show and we are
 
06:57:38.990 --> 06:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
precipitously near that edge for that
 
06:57:40.128 --> 06:57:40.138 align:start position:0%
kind of thing happening and it's not
 
06:57:41.930 --> 06:57:41.940 align:start position:0%
just you know the the money is a lot of
 
06:57:43.368 --> 06:57:43.378 align:start position:0%
other things you know you heard about
 
06:57:44.868 --> 06:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
things like supply chain you heard about
 
06:57:47.090 --> 06:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
you know the distance of travel you know
 
06:57:48.468 --> 06:57:48.478 align:start position:0%
some of these you know people somebody
 
06:57:50.690 --> 06:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
said eight thousand dollar transfer you
 
06:57:52.730 --> 06:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
know yeah that's real but it's not
 
06:57:54.530 --> 06:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
somebody that's going three miles as the
 
06:57:55.788 --> 06:57:55.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner said it's somebody that's
 
06:57:57.590 --> 06:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
going a hundred miles you know New
 
06:57:59.810 --> 06:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
London to Boston you know it's pretty
 
06:58:01.610 --> 06:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
easy mileage to figure out you know
 
06:58:03.048 --> 06:58:03.058 align:start position:0%
somebody's being taken care of on a
 
06:58:05.030 --> 06:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
ventilator you know in Mass indexing in
 
06:58:06.890 --> 06:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's not just a you know
 
06:58:08.810 --> 06:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
one person in the back you know transfer
 
06:58:10.788 --> 06:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
that requires at least three people one
 
06:58:12.530 --> 06:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
person driving two people in the back
 
06:58:14.810 --> 06:58:14.820 align:start position:0%
and that's statutory that's not you know
 
06:58:16.670 --> 06:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
my decision saying oh I'm gonna put two
 
06:58:19.070 --> 06:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
people back there so you know I again
 
06:58:20.750 --> 06:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
just there's more eloquent people coming
 
06:58:22.670 --> 06:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
after me that I have a lot better things
 
06:58:24.530 --> 06:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
to say please listen to them and I thank
 
06:58:25.788 --> 06:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
06:58:27.948 --> 06:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
oh do I have a question
 
06:58:29.208 --> 06:58:29.218 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
06:58:32.930 --> 06:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:34.548 --> 06:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
ma'am if you can figure that out you're
 
06:58:36.968 --> 06:58:36.978 align:start position:0%
a lot smarter than me
 
06:58:39.590 --> 06:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
honestly it's uh it's very complicated
 
06:58:41.448 --> 06:58:41.458 align:start position:0%
you know because you do have the rural
 
06:58:43.548 --> 06:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
you know considerations you have you
 
06:58:45.590 --> 06:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
know I'm I have Nate sitting behind me I
 
06:58:47.270 --> 06:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
thought I was Far New London Colebrook
 
06:58:49.250 --> 06:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
beats me two times three times over
 
06:58:51.468 --> 06:58:51.478 align:start position:0%
and you know there's you know the when I
 
06:58:53.390 --> 06:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
first started in this job 30 years ago I
 
06:58:55.190 --> 06:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
graduated from New Hampshire Tech in
 
06:58:58.010 --> 06:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
1992 and you know what we could do back
 
06:58:59.390 --> 06:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
then is we could stick a line in
 
06:59:01.310 --> 06:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
somebody and shock them and maybe go to
 
06:59:03.170 --> 06:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
the hospital what you get now in a
 
06:59:05.628 --> 06:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
paramedic ambulance is the technology
 
06:59:08.030 --> 06:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
and the skill is amazing and people have
 
06:59:09.948 --> 06:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
that expectation to show up whether it's
 
06:59:13.010 --> 06:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
you know in Manchester or Colebrook or
 
06:59:14.690 --> 06:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
little Springfield you know I saw
 
06:59:16.250 --> 06:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
Grantham from somebody is on this
 
06:59:18.170 --> 06:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
committee you know the expectation is
 
06:59:19.730 --> 06:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
they're getting that level of care that
 
06:59:28.330 --> 06:59:28.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:30.770 --> 06:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly
 
06:59:32.750 --> 06:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
no she's not going to ask a question she
 
06:59:34.910 --> 06:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
she has a some she needs to tell Jane
 
06:59:34.920 --> 06:59:38.030 align:start position:0%
she has a some she needs to tell Jane
something

06:59:38.030 --> 06:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:40.250 --> 06:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs
 
06:59:43.910 --> 06:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
um would it be helpful uh if the
 
06:59:46.850 --> 06:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
insurance companies were required to
 
06:59:49.610 --> 06:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
send their check to the ambulance
 
06:59:52.490 --> 06:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
provider rather than to the patient I
 
06:59:55.430 --> 06:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
think it it's I think that is them just
 
06:59:57.830 --> 06:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
simply strong arming the ambulance you
 
06:59:59.690 --> 06:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
know it needs to happen because that is
 
07:00:01.250 --> 07:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you I worked for a private
 
07:00:04.670 --> 07:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
Service as a collection manager down in
 
07:00:07.968 --> 07:00:07.978 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and they went to steps as
 
07:00:10.128 --> 07:00:10.138 align:start position:0%
you know to take people to court to lean
 
07:00:12.830 --> 07:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
houses to you know to go after other you
 
07:00:13.788 --> 07:00:13.798 align:start position:0%
know Monies
 
07:00:15.410 --> 07:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
that's the additional steps that we have
 
07:00:17.570 --> 07:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
to take just to survive you know so that
 
07:00:19.310 --> 07:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
money would be much better used going
 
07:00:21.288 --> 07:00:21.298 align:start position:0%
directly to the provider so the answer
 
07:00:23.150 --> 07:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
is yes it would be helpful
 
07:00:29.708 --> 07:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:32.570 --> 07:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
it was in pillow thank you Mr chair
 
07:00:34.430 --> 07:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so do
 
07:00:36.230 --> 07:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
you think there should be a state fund
 
07:00:38.990 --> 07:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
to help support
 
07:00:41.930 --> 07:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh the ambulance services especially the
 
07:00:45.410 --> 07:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:45.420 --> 07:00:47.448 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:00:47.448 --> 07:00:47.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:49.070 --> 07:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
I think that any source of money that
 
07:00:50.030 --> 07:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
can help
 
07:00:51.890 --> 07:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
is going to be beneficial
 
07:00:54.230 --> 07:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
I think that you know the
 
07:00:56.090 --> 07:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
and I I understand the insurance
 
07:01:00.048 --> 07:01:00.058 align:start position:0%
company's problem I do I you know but I
 
07:01:02.090 --> 07:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
wear a paramedic patch and I respond to
 
07:01:03.590 --> 07:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
emergencies and I know what's needed to
 
07:01:06.350 --> 07:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
do that call if there's a value to you
 
07:01:09.830 --> 07:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
know having that resource available and
 
07:01:11.030 --> 07:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
you think about here in New Hampshire
 
07:01:13.368 --> 07:01:13.378 align:start position:0%
you know down in Mass down in the uh the
 
07:01:14.990 --> 07:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
southern side that resource is more
 
07:01:16.788 --> 07:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
available than say I mean I can't even
 
07:01:19.368 --> 07:01:19.378 align:start position:0%
imagine cold Works problems you know an
 
07:01:21.170 --> 07:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
hour response time I was complaining the
 
07:01:22.490 --> 07:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
other day it took 22 minutes to get
 
07:01:25.250 --> 07:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
somewhere you know there so any source
 
07:01:26.868 --> 07:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
of Revenue that can help out these
 
07:01:29.390 --> 07:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
Services mine included
 
07:01:32.890 --> 07:01:32.900 align:start position:0%
this would be helpful thanks thank you

07:01:49.730 --> 07:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
mileage their time their labor their
 
07:01:53.090 --> 07:01:53.100 align:start position:0%
everything they would use and needs to
 
07:01:56.390 --> 07:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
be replenished in helping an individual
 
07:01:59.690 --> 07:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
what why can't you put that forth as a
 
07:01:59.700 --> 07:02:00.650 align:start position:0%
what why can't you put that forth as a

07:02:05.208 --> 07:02:05.218 align:start position:0%
they they do we do well you don't you
 
07:02:06.410 --> 07:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
don't think they should change how much
 
07:02:08.030 --> 07:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
they send the invoice
 
07:02:12.468 --> 07:02:12.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:14.868 --> 07:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
so so the issue is you're not getting
 
07:02:17.330 --> 07:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
paid because it's going to the customer
 
07:02:19.030 --> 07:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
that is one of the issues
 
07:02:21.530 --> 07:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
and what is the issue issue is the
 
07:02:24.170 --> 07:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
insurance companies reimbursement you
 
07:02:25.310 --> 07:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
know for it
 
07:02:27.548 --> 07:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
why aren't they reimbursing them
 
07:02:31.368 --> 07:02:31.378 align:start position:0%
representative representative prove if I
 
07:02:32.810 --> 07:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
may just like he's not here but
 
07:02:34.610 --> 07:02:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative pru made a good point you
 
07:02:38.270 --> 07:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
know the scale or the um the fee
 
07:02:40.010 --> 07:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
schedule that is sometimes provided by
 
07:02:41.628 --> 07:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
insurance companies is not something
 
07:02:43.548 --> 07:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
that's ever been shared and said you
 
07:02:46.490 --> 07:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
know let's look at this as a actual this
 
07:02:47.810 --> 07:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
is what it costs this is what you should
 
07:02:49.430 --> 07:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
be in reimbursed and negotiated on
 
07:02:51.230 --> 07:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
there's a schedule somewhere that exists
 
07:02:52.670 --> 07:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
that is nebulous and has not been
 
07:02:55.430 --> 07:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
provided some places are contracted
 
07:02:57.170 --> 07:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
Medicare of course is contracted we get
 
07:02:58.850 --> 07:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
what we we get
 
07:03:00.590 --> 07:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
yeah to the end of the day insurance
 
07:03:02.150 --> 07:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
company is going to send the check that
 
07:03:04.250 --> 07:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
they think that they've
 
07:03:06.230 --> 07:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
there's no obligation we don't have a
 
07:03:07.968 --> 07:03:07.978 align:start position:0%
law that says to the insurance company
 
07:03:11.030 --> 07:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
they got to pay the rack rate
 
07:03:12.530 --> 07:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
the full rate
 
07:03:12.540 --> 07:03:14.090 align:start position:0%
the full rate
okay

07:03:14.090 --> 07:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:03:16.430 --> 07:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much all right next is
 
07:03:32.330 --> 07:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:33.770 --> 07:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
good evening
 
07:03:35.390 --> 07:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
I was gonna say good afternoon but I
 
07:03:37.368 --> 07:03:37.378 align:start position:0%
guess it is evening uh so thank you Mr
 
07:03:39.110 --> 07:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
chairman for the record my name is Larry
 
07:03:41.390 --> 07:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
best I'm representing the New Hampshire
 
07:03:43.368 --> 07:03:43.378 align:start position:0%
Association of Fire Chiefs as the
 
07:03:45.590 --> 07:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
president of that Association uh we're
 
07:03:46.968 --> 07:03:46.978 align:start position:0%
going to kind of tag team it today to
 
07:03:49.128 --> 07:03:49.138 align:start position:0%
have Chief setar from uh who's also a
 
07:03:51.890 --> 07:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
member of the association and try and do
 
07:03:53.150 --> 07:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
this as quickly as possible and
 
07:03:56.030 --> 07:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
respectful of your time great um so to
 
07:03:58.430 --> 07:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
just summarize real quickly uh our
 
07:04:00.650 --> 07:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
colleagues ahead of us made a lot of
 
07:04:03.530 --> 07:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
good points and stuff but I just want to
 
07:04:07.250 --> 07:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
talk briefly just about the bill our
 
07:04:10.788 --> 07:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
association opposes this bill We Believe
 
07:04:13.070 --> 07:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh the bill does not address all the
 
07:04:15.948 --> 07:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
issues associated with financing of the
 
07:04:18.650 --> 07:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
provision of ambulance services it's
 
07:04:20.150 --> 07:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
intended to protect protect the
 
07:04:22.850 --> 07:04:22.860 align:start position:0%
customers by curbing the practice of
 
07:04:24.530 --> 07:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
balanced billing
 
07:04:26.208 --> 07:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
um this would obviously it would help
 
07:04:28.968 --> 07:04:28.978 align:start position:0%
the customers with out-of-pocket
 
07:04:31.670 --> 07:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
expenses for individuals however it does
 
07:04:33.948 --> 07:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
not address how providers of ambulance
 
07:04:36.590 --> 07:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
services would ensure that we recoup
 
07:04:39.410 --> 07:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
lost Revenue speaking from the
 
07:04:41.810 --> 07:04:41.820 align:start position:0%
perspective I forgot to mention I'm also
 
07:04:45.170 --> 07:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
the fire chief in Salem So speaking from
 
07:04:48.170 --> 07:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
the municipal ambulance perspective of
 
07:04:49.968 --> 07:04:49.978 align:start position:0%
such as the local fire department that's
 
07:04:52.788 --> 07:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
providing the ambulance service we don't
 
07:04:52.798 --> 07:04:53.750 align:start position:0%
providing the ambulance service we don't
really

07:04:53.750 --> 07:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
07:04:56.150 --> 07:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
we aren't in this to generate a profit
 
07:04:59.270 --> 07:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
we're in this to as far as the billing
 
07:05:02.090 --> 07:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
goes it's to try and recoup some of the
 
07:05:05.628 --> 07:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
costs of providing the services I can
 
07:05:08.690 --> 07:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
speak for my department in particular as
 
07:05:10.788 --> 07:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
we don't cover all the costs that it
 
07:05:14.030 --> 07:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
runs that it takes with the balance
 
07:05:16.190 --> 07:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
billing and the effect of this and again
 
07:05:18.048 --> 07:05:18.058 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try and summarize this for
 
07:05:18.058 --> 07:05:19.610 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try and summarize this for
timeliness

07:05:19.610 --> 07:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
timeliness
 
07:05:19.620 --> 07:05:20.510 align:start position:0%
timeliness
um

07:05:20.510 --> 07:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:23.448 --> 07:05:23.458 align:start position:0%
it helps us offset and if we don't if we
 
07:05:26.690 --> 07:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
lose that balance billing and we lose
 
07:05:30.350 --> 07:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
that Revenue then as a municipality the
 
07:05:32.810 --> 07:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
only place we have to turn is the
 
07:05:35.990 --> 07:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the local taxpayers kind of
 
07:05:39.410 --> 07:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
how we view the 911 emergency ambulance
 
07:05:41.390 --> 07:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
service because that's what we most of
 
07:05:45.530 --> 07:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
us as Fire Chiefs deal with is the
 
07:05:47.570 --> 07:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
taxpayer all the taxpayers in a
 
07:05:50.270 --> 07:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
particular Community pays taxes to have
 
07:05:53.448 --> 07:05:53.458 align:start position:0%
that ambulance on standby and Associated
 
07:05:54.968 --> 07:05:54.978 align:start position:0%
Personnel cost
 
07:05:58.430 --> 07:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
on standby and ready if that ambulance
 
07:06:00.708 --> 07:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
is needed and once there's an emergency
 
07:06:04.368 --> 07:06:04.378 align:start position:0%
medical call then the user with the help
 
07:06:06.890 --> 07:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
of their insurance company pays the cost
 
07:06:10.030 --> 07:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
of providing that service to them
 
07:06:13.368 --> 07:06:13.378 align:start position:0%
providing that service to the patient so
 
07:06:15.530 --> 07:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
again with that as far as the
 
07:06:15.540 --> 07:06:16.850 align:start position:0%
again with that as far as the
communities

07:06:16.850 --> 07:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
communities
 
07:06:19.190 --> 07:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
we provide an opportunity as most
 
07:06:21.288 --> 07:06:21.298 align:start position:0%
communities provide an opportunity for
 
07:06:24.890 --> 07:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
an individual to demonstrate a hardship
 
07:06:28.150 --> 07:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
most communities work with a patient
 
07:06:32.350 --> 07:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
with payment plans or hardship programs
 
07:06:35.930 --> 07:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
so we communities work with this and
 
07:06:37.490 --> 07:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
this is something that we we do on a
 
07:06:39.890 --> 07:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
regular basis it's also important to
 
07:06:41.690 --> 07:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
remember that any individual who's
 
07:06:45.468 --> 07:06:45.478 align:start position:0%
covered by Medicare and Medicaid cannot
 
07:06:47.570 --> 07:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
receive a balanced bill so that's
 
07:06:49.010 --> 07:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
important to remember as well that's
 
07:06:51.890 --> 07:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
just Captain it is what it is and stuff
 
07:06:55.610 --> 07:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
I talked about the Lost Revenue
 
07:06:55.620 --> 07:06:56.990 align:start position:0%
I talked about the Lost Revenue
um

07:06:56.990 --> 07:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:59.270 --> 07:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
and again it's just to offset portions
 
07:07:01.548 --> 07:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
of our costs of operating the ambulance
 
07:07:01.558 --> 07:07:03.110 align:start position:0%
of our costs of operating the ambulance
so

07:07:03.110 --> 07:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:07:05.448 --> 07:07:05.458 align:start position:0%
moving forward the New Hampshire
 
07:07:07.190 --> 07:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
Association of Fire Chiefs we'd prefer
 
07:07:09.170 --> 07:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
to see legislation that both insures
 
07:07:12.410 --> 07:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
customers are protected um that but it
 
07:07:16.310 --> 07:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
also provides more certainty regarding
 
07:07:18.530 --> 07:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement levels of providing
 
07:07:20.930 --> 07:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
the ambulance services the bill
 
07:07:24.650 --> 07:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
obviously curbs the bill seeks to curb
 
07:07:27.288 --> 07:07:27.298 align:start position:0%
the practice first and of balance
 
07:07:29.330 --> 07:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
billing and then have the Department of
 
07:07:32.030 --> 07:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
Insurance develop a report to determine
 
07:07:35.448 --> 07:07:35.458 align:start position:0%
the impact from our perspective it would
 
07:07:38.570 --> 07:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
make more sense to finalize the extent
 
07:07:40.968 --> 07:07:40.978 align:start position:0%
of Actuarial study that's referenced in
 
07:07:44.330 --> 07:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
the the back of the bill if we can do
 
07:07:46.730 --> 07:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
that first get the fiscal note first and
 
07:07:50.170 --> 07:07:50.180 align:start position:0%
then work on it to work on it and stuff
 
07:07:52.490 --> 07:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
from there decisions about carbon
 
07:07:54.288 --> 07:07:54.298 align:start position:0%
curbing balance billing would make more
 
07:07:56.208 --> 07:07:56.218 align:start position:0%
sense if we got to know what the fiscal
 
07:07:58.968 --> 07:07:58.978 align:start position:0%
impact is and stuff so this legislation
 
07:08:02.090 --> 07:08:02.100 align:start position:0%
obviously proposes the end ending the
 
07:08:04.730 --> 07:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
practice without an alternative to
 
07:08:06.110 --> 07:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that providers will be
 
07:08:08.990 --> 07:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
compensated accurately by the carriers
 
07:08:12.048 --> 07:08:12.058 align:start position:0%
so we've heard how that is handled from
 
07:08:14.890 --> 07:08:14.900 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony given
 
07:08:18.288 --> 07:08:18.298 align:start position:0%
further the prospect of appealing
 
07:08:20.510 --> 07:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement amounts from carriers to
 
07:08:21.590 --> 07:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
07:08:24.350 --> 07:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
Insurance just trying to picture how
 
07:08:26.570 --> 07:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
that would work is it would likely
 
07:08:28.910 --> 07:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
require many municipalities to devote
 
07:08:32.090 --> 07:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
more costs to Legal expenses regular
 
07:08:34.128 --> 07:08:34.138 align:start position:0%
staff to to be able to deal with this so
 
07:08:36.230 --> 07:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to put more of a burden on
 
07:08:38.810 --> 07:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
your local municipalities to do this as
 
07:08:41.930 --> 07:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
there's appeals and so on it would make
 
07:08:43.910 --> 07:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
an already administratively challenging
 
07:08:47.810 --> 07:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
challenging process even more difficult
 
07:08:50.150 --> 07:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
just kind of wrapping up so last session
 
07:08:53.208 --> 07:08:53.218 align:start position:0%
the house of Commerce Committee uh had
 
07:08:56.390 --> 07:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 343 relative to billing for
 
07:08:59.330 --> 07:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
ambulance services they sent it to an
 
07:09:01.910 --> 07:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
interim Study last fall that committee
 
07:09:05.048 --> 07:09:05.058 align:start position:0%
voted 15 to 1 to not recommend similar
 
07:09:07.548 --> 07:09:07.558 align:start position:0%
legislation the committee report
 
07:09:09.170 --> 07:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
indicated that there would be meetings
 
07:09:10.670 --> 07:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders prior to
 
07:09:15.288 --> 07:09:15.298 align:start position:0%
reintroduction of legislation in 2023 if
 
07:09:17.448 --> 07:09:17.458 align:start position:0%
those meetings occurred we as the New
 
07:09:20.330 --> 07:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiefs we did not participate
 
07:09:21.890 --> 07:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
we didn't know I don't know if meetings
 
07:09:24.948 --> 07:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
occurred or not we believe that we're a
 
07:09:27.110 --> 07:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
key a key stakeholder in these services
 
07:09:29.948 --> 07:09:29.958 align:start position:0%
that are provided by many of our local
 
07:09:32.390 --> 07:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities and fire departments we
 
07:09:34.548 --> 07:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
would welcome the opportunity to work
 
07:09:36.350 --> 07:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
with anyone who's interested in this
 
07:09:38.150 --> 07:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
subject and try and develop a better
 
07:09:38.160 --> 07:09:39.830 align:start position:0%
subject and try and develop a better
solution

07:09:39.830 --> 07:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
solution
 
07:09:42.288 --> 07:09:42.298 align:start position:0%
um so finally we are concerned that if
 
07:09:44.150 --> 07:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
that if reasonable rates are not
 
07:09:46.070 --> 07:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
determined prior to the implementation
 
07:09:49.310 --> 07:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
of this balanced billing prohibition
 
07:09:50.990 --> 07:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
um it would have a negative effect on
 
07:09:53.208 --> 07:09:53.218 align:start position:0%
the entire EMS system and could end up
 
07:09:55.850 --> 07:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
causing uh the local taxpayer to even
 
07:09:58.930 --> 07:09:58.940 align:start position:0%
pay more through their Municipal Taxes
 
07:10:02.090 --> 07:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
to for the ambulances and and funding
 
07:10:04.010 --> 07:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
and stuff just because a lot of this is
 
07:10:06.288 --> 07:10:06.298 align:start position:0%
offsetting revenue that we would receive
 
07:10:08.990 --> 07:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
as a municipality I'd be happy to answer
 
07:10:10.968 --> 07:10:10.978 align:start position:0%
any questions and I Know Chief cetar
 
07:10:13.368 --> 07:10:13.378 align:start position:0%
also has a few comments
 
07:10:13.378 --> 07:10:14.868 align:start position:0%
also has a few comments
foreign

07:10:14.868 --> 07:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:10:17.208 --> 07:10:17.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Mike
 
07:10:18.770 --> 07:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
Sita I'm the chief of the Tilton
 
07:10:21.530 --> 07:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
Northfield fire district one of the
 
07:10:24.890 --> 07:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
things I talk about is the rural and and
 
07:10:27.410 --> 07:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
stuff and what I'm doing right now in my
 
07:10:29.390 --> 07:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
department which is required from every
 
07:10:32.270 --> 07:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance thing is to fill out
 
07:10:34.788 --> 07:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
this Medicare ground ambulance data
 
07:10:34.798 --> 07:10:35.750 align:start position:0%
this Medicare ground ambulance data
collection

07:10:35.750 --> 07:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
collection
 
07:10:38.208 --> 07:10:38.218 align:start position:0%
so over a course of four years every
 
07:10:40.010 --> 07:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance is going to fill it out
 
07:10:42.288 --> 07:10:42.298 align:start position:0%
this is the the directions on how to
 
07:10:44.208 --> 07:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
fill it out and they give you you take
 
07:10:46.670 --> 07:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
your data from one year and you they
 
07:10:49.430 --> 07:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
give you five months at the end of that
 
07:10:53.330 --> 07:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
one year to fill out this form
 
07:10:55.128 --> 07:10:55.138 align:start position:0%
um it's done on the computer but these
 
07:10:56.690 --> 07:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
are the direction so I'm in the middle
 
07:10:59.750 --> 07:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
of that process right now but they may
 
07:11:01.548 --> 07:11:01.558 align:start position:0%
try to make a distinction this is
 
07:11:03.110 --> 07:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
certainly big difference between a
 
07:11:05.570 --> 07:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
Suburban Ambulance Service a rural
 
07:11:08.090 --> 07:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service and say up in Coburn
 
07:11:09.830 --> 07:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
where it would be it's considered a
 
07:11:12.590 --> 07:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
super rural Ambulance Service and
 
07:11:14.448 --> 07:11:14.458 align:start position:0%
Medicare is trying to take that into
 
07:11:16.910 --> 07:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
effect when they're collecting this data
 
07:11:19.610 --> 07:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
but I think it would be fair if we wait
 
07:11:22.190 --> 07:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
until all this data is collected and we
 
07:11:23.990 --> 07:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
have the actual numbers of what it
 
07:11:25.910 --> 07:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
really costs to run an ambulance service
 
07:11:28.670 --> 07:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
and all those different categories and
 
07:11:31.610 --> 07:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
come up with appropriate rates using all
 
07:11:33.830 --> 07:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
that data before we start limiting
 
07:11:37.128 --> 07:11:37.138 align:start position:0%
balance billing by the EMS services and
 
07:11:40.610 --> 07:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
again as Chief best says
 
07:11:43.070 --> 07:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
I think my department charges a very
 
07:11:45.830 --> 07:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
fair rate for the services we provide
 
07:11:49.070 --> 07:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
we do not balance Bill people who live
 
07:11:50.770 --> 07:11:50.780 align:start position:0%
within the fire district
 
07:11:53.390 --> 07:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
we only end up balance billing people
 
07:11:55.250 --> 07:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
who have private insurances that live
 
07:11:57.230 --> 07:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
outside the fire district and then
 
07:11:59.208 --> 07:11:59.218 align:start position:0%
usually most of the times the balance
 
07:12:02.708 --> 07:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
bill is their co-pay or their deductible
 
07:12:05.628 --> 07:12:05.638 align:start position:0%
so you know they have a contract with
 
07:12:07.368 --> 07:12:07.378 align:start position:0%
their insurance whichever one they have
 
07:12:09.468 --> 07:12:09.478 align:start position:0%
at that time that you know they will pay
 
07:12:11.810 --> 07:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
a co-pay for services or they have a
 
07:12:16.190 --> 07:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
deductible for services and the
 
07:12:17.448 --> 07:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
insurance companies the private
 
07:12:18.890 --> 07:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
insurance companies generally send a
 
07:12:21.650 --> 07:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
check to the the the
 
07:12:25.910 --> 07:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
owner of the insurance and and not often
 
07:12:28.190 --> 07:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
do we get that check and so it's a loss
 
07:12:30.530 --> 07:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
for us and uh in the end we'll end up
 
07:12:32.510 --> 07:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
having to write it off at some point and
 
07:12:34.788 --> 07:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
the cost of that is actually absorbed by
 
07:12:37.070 --> 07:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers of the five district and
 
07:12:37.080 --> 07:12:38.208 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers of the five district and
so

07:12:38.208 --> 07:12:38.218 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:12:39.890 --> 07:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
I think what was we're looking for
 
07:12:41.868 --> 07:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
something that that's there
 
07:12:44.448 --> 07:12:44.458 align:start position:0%
fair for everybody we're not out to
 
07:12:46.788 --> 07:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
bankrupt anybody I've never taken
 
07:12:49.390 --> 07:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
anybody to court over an ambulance bill
 
07:12:52.850 --> 07:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
because most of my ambulance bills you
 
07:12:56.208 --> 07:12:56.218 align:start position:0%
know the you know 1400 or 1600 dollars
 
07:12:58.250 --> 07:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
for the level of service that's an ALS
 
07:13:02.708 --> 07:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
One Rate there's a basic rate ALS one
 
07:13:06.468 --> 07:13:06.478 align:start position:0%
ALS 2 and special DKR rate those eight
 
07:13:08.330 --> 07:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar transports those are
 
07:13:11.390 --> 07:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
Specialty Care rates uh very rarely do I
 
07:13:13.310 --> 07:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
have one of those in my service
 
07:13:16.070 --> 07:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
but um we want what's fair we don't want
 
07:13:18.288 --> 07:13:18.298 align:start position:0%
to be we're not in it for the money we
 
07:13:20.868 --> 07:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
just want to try and help uh recoup some
 
07:13:23.090 --> 07:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
of the costs that if for this very very
 
07:13:25.010 --> 07:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
expensive service
 
07:13:31.190 --> 07:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:33.530 --> 07:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr
 
07:13:33.540 --> 07:13:34.850 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr
chairman

07:13:34.850 --> 07:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
07:13:37.968 --> 07:13:37.978 align:start position:0%
um you've spoken about the um problems
 
07:13:40.850 --> 07:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
of Revenue loss um that would be created
 
07:13:44.570 --> 07:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
by um ending balance billing and
 
07:13:46.610 --> 07:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
um I thank you for how clearly you've
 
07:13:49.070 --> 07:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
explained the problem and also I want to
 
07:13:49.080 --> 07:13:49.788 align:start position:0%
explained the problem and also I want to
thank

07:13:49.788 --> 07:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:13:51.830 --> 07:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
um some of the other uh representatives
 
07:13:53.990 --> 07:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
of ambulance services
 
07:13:56.390 --> 07:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
um for how clearly they've explained uh
 
07:13:59.448 --> 07:13:59.458 align:start position:0%
the revenue problems that affect their
 
07:14:02.890 --> 07:14:02.900 align:start position:0%
ambulance services uh but you haven't
 
07:14:06.230 --> 07:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
really addressed the other half of the
 
07:14:08.690 --> 07:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
requirements of this bill so I'd like to
 
07:14:11.810 --> 07:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
ask you the same question that I asked
 
07:14:15.288 --> 07:14:15.298 align:start position:0%
the person who testified just before you
 
07:14:18.830 --> 07:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
and that is would it help would it help
 
07:14:22.128 --> 07:14:22.138 align:start position:0%
your members uh if the insurance
 
07:14:25.128 --> 07:14:25.138 align:start position:0%
companies were required to send their
 
07:14:27.170 --> 07:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
checks directly to the ambulance
 
07:14:30.590 --> 07:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
providers rather than to the patient yes
 
07:14:32.868 --> 07:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
I believe that would help
 
07:14:35.510 --> 07:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:14:37.730 --> 07:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that was a good move
 
07:14:40.150 --> 07:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
since you lived so close
 
07:14:44.390 --> 07:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
have you ever remembered uh
 
07:14:46.430 --> 07:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is one of those it's really
 
07:14:48.350 --> 07:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
all about the money I don't I don't see
 
07:14:51.048 --> 07:14:51.058 align:start position:0%
that this bill is going to
 
07:14:53.448 --> 07:14:53.458 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
07:14:55.250 --> 07:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody's
 
07:14:57.770 --> 07:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
making money in the ambulance business
 
07:15:01.670 --> 07:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
outside of the Metro areas if that
 
07:15:04.490 --> 07:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
so in our rural towns where there's no
 
07:15:06.048 --> 07:15:06.058 align:start position:0%
way you're going to make money this is
 
07:15:08.750 --> 07:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
to not balance bill means how much money
 
07:15:10.430 --> 07:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
am I going to lose
 
07:15:13.968 --> 07:15:13.978 align:start position:0%
but my question or or not lose as a town
 
07:15:17.090 --> 07:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is what percentage
 
07:15:17.100 --> 07:15:19.430 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is what percentage
of

07:15:19.430 --> 07:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:15:22.128 --> 07:15:22.138 align:start position:0%
ambulance services in the state do you
 
07:15:25.430 --> 07:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
think or no are actually for profit
 
07:15:29.690 --> 07:15:29.700 align:start position:0%
versus semi-volunteer for town
 
07:15:32.208 --> 07:15:32.218 align:start position:0%
the only ones that I know of a prophet
 
07:15:34.990 --> 07:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
are the private ambulances Services
 
07:15:37.250 --> 07:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
most ambulance services that I'm aware
 
07:15:40.310 --> 07:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
of are run by municipalities
 
07:15:42.410 --> 07:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
um they're certainly not for profit and
 
07:15:44.090 --> 07:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
then there are certainly a lot of
 
07:15:47.030 --> 07:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
ambulance services that are um
 
07:15:49.430 --> 07:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
non-profits they're non-profit as well
 
07:15:52.010 --> 07:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey Rindge is non-profit yeah
 
07:15:53.810 --> 07:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
yeah but but I would say that you know
 
07:15:55.610 --> 07:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
like the big companies like Stuarts or
 
07:15:57.890 --> 07:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
Ami I certainly think that they would be
 
07:16:00.830 --> 07:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:02.990 --> 07:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
so then the majority
 
07:16:07.490 --> 07:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
are volunteer or municipal
 
07:16:09.468 --> 07:16:09.478 align:start position:0%
so all we're really doing is trying to
 
07:16:11.090 --> 07:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
recoup our costs
 
07:16:13.850 --> 07:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes otherwise the
 
07:16:15.468 --> 07:16:15.478 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are gonna have to
 
07:16:17.930 --> 07:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
pick it up for us there's some Cheshire
 
07:16:20.448 --> 07:16:20.458 align:start position:0%
county and we're not even going to get
 
07:16:23.030 --> 07:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
the tracks in our town okay so thank you
 
07:16:25.910 --> 07:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
very much guys thank you okay so I was
 
07:16:33.350 --> 07:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:34.610 --> 07:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
you were
 
07:16:36.770 --> 07:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
didn't see you there with all those guys
 
07:16:39.490 --> 07:16:39.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:42.948 --> 07:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
so now we're getting to how far away I
 
07:16:47.410 --> 07:16:47.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:51.350 --> 07:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
and then we have Ed Walker good um thank
 
07:16:52.850 --> 07:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
you I was going to start my remarks with
 
07:16:54.288 --> 07:16:54.298 align:start position:0%
good afternoon but I'll start them with
 
07:16:55.548 --> 07:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
good evening
 
07:16:57.048 --> 07:16:57.058 align:start position:0%
um so I'm Ed Walker the fire chief and
 
07:16:58.730 --> 07:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
ambulance service director for the town
 
07:17:00.468 --> 07:17:00.478 align:start position:0%
of Peterborough I've been active in the
 
07:17:02.208 --> 07:17:02.218 align:start position:0%
fire and Emergency Medical Services for
 
07:17:04.850 --> 07:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
over 40 years 14 of which is leading
 
07:17:06.530 --> 07:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
municipal fire departments with
 
07:17:08.810 --> 07:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
transport ambulances I'm here to urge
 
07:17:11.750 --> 07:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
you today to reject House Bill 373 which
 
07:17:13.310 --> 07:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
seeks to eliminate the ability for
 
07:17:14.990 --> 07:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
ambulance services in the state of New
 
07:17:16.968 --> 07:17:16.978 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to build patients for fees or
 
07:17:18.730 --> 07:17:18.740 align:start position:0%
amounts other than co-payments
 
07:17:20.990 --> 07:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
deductibles or coinsurance if the
 
07:17:22.310 --> 07:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
service is covered under the patient's
 
07:17:23.868 --> 07:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
health insurance plan
 
07:17:25.490 --> 07:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
China Peterborough ambulance provides
 
07:17:28.128 --> 07:17:28.138 align:start position:0%
emergency transport service to over 13
 
07:17:30.468 --> 07:17:30.478 align:start position:0%
000 residents in six communities as well
 
07:17:32.390 --> 07:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
as emerging and non-emergent transports
 
07:17:34.368 --> 07:17:34.378 align:start position:0%
out of Monona Community Hospital are
 
07:17:36.890 --> 07:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
local critical access hospital last year
 
07:17:39.590 --> 07:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
we transported over 1800 patients from
 
07:17:42.110 --> 07:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
our 2500 plus calls
 
07:17:44.270 --> 07:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
during the past decade we have seen the
 
07:17:46.430 --> 07:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of original charge paid by
 
07:17:48.708 --> 07:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
primary Insurance fall from 43 percent
 
07:17:51.650 --> 07:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
to 33 percent while the cost for
 
07:17:52.910 --> 07:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
delivery of those Services have
 
07:17:54.590 --> 07:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
significantly increased
 
07:17:56.930 --> 07:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
although taxpayers are in our service
 
07:17:58.490 --> 07:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
communities contribute to the operating
 
07:18:00.890 --> 07:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
budget we rely heavily on patient
 
07:18:03.170 --> 07:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
billing Revenue to fund the service with
 
07:18:04.730 --> 07:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
the above reference decrease in direct
 
07:18:06.708 --> 07:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
insurance payments it is more important
 
07:18:08.448 --> 07:18:08.458 align:start position:0%
than ambulance services maintain the
 
07:18:10.490 --> 07:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
ability to build the user of the service
 
07:18:13.610 --> 07:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
for the direct cost for those services
 
07:18:15.048 --> 07:18:15.058 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges we would face
 
07:18:17.208 --> 07:18:17.218 align:start position:0%
which has been addressed is their
 
07:18:19.070 --> 07:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
ability to determine what is a managed
 
07:18:20.090 --> 07:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
care plan
 
07:18:21.708 --> 07:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
even though the healthcare business
 
07:18:23.330 --> 07:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
management association the American
 
07:18:25.368 --> 07:18:25.378 align:start position:0%
Medical Association and most other
 
07:18:26.930 --> 07:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
professional health care organizations
 
07:18:29.150 --> 07:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
have jointly pleaded with Congress and
 
07:18:31.490 --> 07:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
CMS center for Medicare Medicaid
 
07:18:34.010 --> 07:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
services to mandate insurers disclose
 
07:18:37.010 --> 07:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
the type of plan of beneficiary is on
 
07:18:38.930 --> 07:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
a second challenge is the different way
 
07:18:41.448 --> 07:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
payers adjudicate claims to having
 
07:18:43.548 --> 07:18:43.558 align:start position:0%
exhausted that process up to and
 
07:18:45.650 --> 07:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
including mediation before being able to
 
07:18:45.660 --> 07:18:46.850 align:start position:0%
including mediation before being able to
appeal

07:18:46.850 --> 07:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
07:18:49.850 --> 07:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
some real numbers in 2022 after removing
 
07:18:51.948 --> 07:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid and federal insurers
 
07:18:54.610 --> 07:18:54.620 align:start position:0%
the amount collected from patients was
 
07:18:59.208 --> 07:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
234 159 dollars for our service a
 
07:19:01.730 --> 07:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
sizable portion of that would have been
 
07:19:03.890 --> 07:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
at risk had this law been affected our
 
07:19:05.448 --> 07:19:05.458 align:start position:0%
billing company estimates that loss
 
07:19:07.968 --> 07:19:07.978 align:start position:0%
would have ranged between 100 and 150
 
07:19:10.788 --> 07:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
000 or 12 to 18 percent of our
 
07:19:12.708 --> 07:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
non-taxpayer Revenue
 
07:19:14.868 --> 07:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
meanwhile the proposed Bill seeks to
 
07:19:16.670 --> 07:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
circumvent the current federal process
 
07:19:18.830 --> 07:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
which Chiefs a card spoke to of
 
07:19:20.628 --> 07:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
obtaining real low cost data from ground
 
07:19:23.570 --> 07:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
ambulance services this bill as proposed
 
07:19:25.430 --> 07:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
would only create more confusion in the
 
07:19:28.190 --> 07:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
industry in the public mindset worse it
 
07:19:29.690 --> 07:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
benefits the insurance industry while
 
07:19:31.368 --> 07:19:31.378 align:start position:0%
placing more burden on our local tax
 
07:19:31.378 --> 07:19:32.628 align:start position:0%
placing more burden on our local tax
base

07:19:32.628 --> 07:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
base
 
07:19:34.430 --> 07:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
everybody would like to limit the impact
 
07:19:36.468 --> 07:19:36.478 align:start position:0%
of emergency ambulance bills Shifting
 
07:19:37.968 --> 07:19:37.978 align:start position:0%
the burden from the insurance companies
 
07:19:39.770 --> 07:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayers should not be the
 
07:19:42.410 --> 07:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
answer let alone the only answer the
 
07:19:43.788 --> 07:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
proposed bill is written treats
 
07:19:45.948 --> 07:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
Municipal ambulance services as villains
 
07:19:47.930 --> 07:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
after patients money while insurance
 
07:19:49.850 --> 07:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
companies are awarded for refusing to
 
07:19:51.350 --> 07:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the true cost of emergency
 
07:19:57.110 --> 07:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:58.968 --> 07:19:58.978 align:start position:0%
I'm going to skip over most of my
 
07:20:00.410 --> 07:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
remarks because most of that's already
 
07:20:02.448 --> 07:20:02.458 align:start position:0%
been covered and and chief Walker did a
 
07:20:04.310 --> 07:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
great job addressing most this issue
 
07:20:06.288 --> 07:20:06.298 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to turn your attention to
 
07:20:07.850 --> 07:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
though is the back page of the letter
 
07:20:11.150 --> 07:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
that I provided which shows how we
 
07:20:13.490 --> 07:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
actually charge out the cost of
 
07:20:16.010 --> 07:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
providing a 911 ambulance service to the
 
07:20:18.890 --> 07:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
communities that we serve so again we
 
07:20:20.628 --> 07:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
serve the towns of Peterborough Dublin
 
07:20:23.750 --> 07:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hancock Temple Francis town and Sharon
 
07:20:26.208 --> 07:20:26.218 align:start position:0%
what we have at the top left hand corner
 
07:20:28.368 --> 07:20:28.378 align:start position:0%
there are our costs these are our actual
 
07:20:31.670 --> 07:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
costs to run the ambulance service in
 
07:20:34.010 --> 07:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
fiscal year of 2022.
 
07:20:36.410 --> 07:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
then we have below that the fees that we
 
07:20:38.810 --> 07:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
we collected uh and this comes from
 
07:20:41.390 --> 07:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
insurance this comes from self-pay this
 
07:20:43.730 --> 07:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
comes from Medicaid and Medicare
 
07:20:45.530 --> 07:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
that leaves us right now with a
 
07:20:49.910 --> 07:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
shortfall of 486 077 dollars
 
07:20:51.590 --> 07:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
and you add to that our Capital
 
07:20:53.390 --> 07:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan costs this is the cost
 
07:20:55.128 --> 07:20:55.138 align:start position:0%
to replace those four hundred fifty
 
07:20:56.628 --> 07:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar ambulances the heart
 
07:20:58.128 --> 07:20:58.138 align:start position:0%
monitors the stretchers and everything
 
07:21:00.770 --> 07:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
else that we need we have a 10-year plan
 
07:21:02.628 --> 07:21:02.638 align:start position:0%
but we only put a portion of it into
 
07:21:04.310 --> 07:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
this contract what you see actually here
 
07:21:06.288 --> 07:21:06.298 align:start position:0%
is a page out of the contract that we
 
07:21:08.330 --> 07:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
have with the other towns
 
07:21:10.490 --> 07:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
then we break that out across all the
 
07:21:12.350 --> 07:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
towns based on the population of each of
 
07:21:14.150 --> 07:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
those communities and the actual call
 
07:21:15.948 --> 07:21:15.958 align:start position:0%
numbers of the communities
 
07:21:17.510 --> 07:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
and then when you have down at the
 
07:21:19.368 --> 07:21:19.378 align:start position:0%
bottom there all the way over to the
 
07:21:21.288 --> 07:21:21.298 align:start position:0%
right the total amount that the
 
07:21:22.788 --> 07:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of each of those communities
 
07:21:25.850 --> 07:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
is obligated to pay to have us continue
 
07:21:27.468 --> 07:21:27.478 align:start position:0%
to provide the service that we're
 
07:21:27.478 --> 07:21:28.910 align:start position:0%
to provide the service that we're
providing

07:21:28.910 --> 07:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
providing
 
07:21:31.250 --> 07:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here really is
 
07:21:33.368 --> 07:21:33.378 align:start position:0%
increasing that cost of service
 
07:21:35.810 --> 07:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
dramatically this isn't this wouldn't be
 
07:21:37.610 --> 07:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
a small increase it would be a big jump
 
07:21:40.368 --> 07:21:40.378 align:start position:0%
if we take the estimates that Chief
 
07:21:42.650 --> 07:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
Walker provided you and added that to
 
07:21:45.230 --> 07:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
what we're already building these towns
 
07:21:48.468 --> 07:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
so when it comes down to it the property
 
07:21:50.448 --> 07:21:50.458 align:start position:0%
taxpayers really are already paying the
 
07:21:51.830 --> 07:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
cost of having the ambulance service
 
07:21:54.110 --> 07:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
available to respond to the patient when
 
07:21:56.390 --> 07:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
the patient needs them what we're really
 
07:21:58.610 --> 07:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
doing when you get down to it is have
 
07:22:00.288 --> 07:22:00.298 align:start position:0%
asking the patient or their insurance
 
07:22:02.868 --> 07:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
company to pay the cost of the service
 
07:22:05.208 --> 07:22:05.218 align:start position:0%
that they're getting itself
 
07:22:07.190 --> 07:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
towns and cities at the end of the day
 
07:22:09.948 --> 07:22:09.958 align:start position:0%
if this pass is as written would be
 
07:22:12.048 --> 07:22:12.058 align:start position:0%
forced to give up deciding what level of
 
07:22:14.448 --> 07:22:14.458 align:start position:0%
Emergency Care their residents need and
 
07:22:16.968 --> 07:22:16.978 align:start position:0%
instead have to be asking if the
 
07:22:18.830 --> 07:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers can afford to provide that
 
07:22:21.288 --> 07:22:21.298 align:start position:0%
emergency care at all
 
07:22:22.968 --> 07:22:22.978 align:start position:0%
I think that's really these are the
 
07:22:24.948 --> 07:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
conversations already having I'm you
 
07:22:26.628 --> 07:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
know as I said Town Administrator for
 
07:22:28.850 --> 07:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
the town of Peterborough so we're in the
 
07:22:30.048 --> 07:22:30.058 align:start position:0%
middle of our budget process right now
 
07:22:31.368 --> 07:22:31.378 align:start position:0%
because we're one of those weird towns
 
07:22:33.048 --> 07:22:33.058 align:start position:0%
that has a Maytown meeting yeah you're
 
07:22:33.058 --> 07:22:34.368 align:start position:0%
that has a Maytown meeting yeah you're
aware

07:22:34.368 --> 07:22:34.378 align:start position:0%
aware
 
07:22:36.230 --> 07:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
um so we're in the middle of this right
 
07:22:38.570 --> 07:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
now and this is a very contentious issue
 
07:22:40.670 --> 07:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
even though so much of the ambulance
 
07:22:43.788 --> 07:22:43.798 align:start position:0%
service is funded by what we receive
 
07:22:46.010 --> 07:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
from the fees that we charge out to the
 
07:22:47.390 --> 07:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
insurance companies Medicaid and
 
07:22:49.368 --> 07:22:49.378 align:start position:0%
Medicare there's still a substantial
 
07:22:50.868 --> 07:22:50.878 align:start position:0%
amount here that we're asking these
 
07:22:53.030 --> 07:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
towns to cover and these bills
 
07:22:54.890 --> 07:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
especially you know Peterborough yes
 
07:22:57.170 --> 07:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
it's a big we pay for most of it most of
 
07:23:00.948 --> 07:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
that unfunded cost but for the town of
 
07:23:04.070 --> 07:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
Francis town a town which only has 1600
 
07:23:06.350 --> 07:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
residents we're asking them to pay
 
07:23:08.330 --> 07:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
seventy four thousand dollars of
 
07:23:10.850 --> 07:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds to support the ambulance
 
07:23:14.750 --> 07:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
service today without asking them to
 
07:23:17.030 --> 07:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
cover more of the cost that the
 
07:23:18.890 --> 07:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are refusing to pay
 
07:23:20.208 --> 07:23:20.218 align:start position:0%
for the service
 
07:23:23.390 --> 07:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
as the others have said we're a rural
 
07:23:25.910 --> 07:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
community not as roles Colebrook but
 
07:23:29.390 --> 07:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
we're still pretty rural our chief and
 
07:23:31.730 --> 07:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
his paramedics and EMTs are on the road
 
07:23:34.670 --> 07:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
for hours at a time bringing folks to
 
07:23:36.230 --> 07:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
the hospitals where they can get the
 
07:23:38.030 --> 07:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
care that they that they need the
 
07:23:40.430 --> 07:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
definitive care that will help them with
 
07:23:42.948 --> 07:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
whatever their immediate issue is yes
 
07:23:45.830 --> 07:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely as I say in this letter I
 
07:23:48.530 --> 07:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
agree that removing that provision in
 
07:23:50.208 --> 07:23:50.218 align:start position:0%
the law that's currently written in that
 
07:23:52.910 --> 07:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
allows the insurance companies to decide
 
07:23:54.410 --> 07:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
where they want to send the check to
 
07:23:56.810 --> 07:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
would be great I think that that would
 
07:23:58.788 --> 07:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
be a vast Improvement it would clear up
 
07:24:00.770 --> 07:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of confusion I can't tell
 
07:24:02.810 --> 07:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
you how many patients have been in my
 
07:24:04.730 --> 07:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
office so confused that they're still
 
07:24:06.830 --> 07:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
getting a bill and not understanding
 
07:24:09.230 --> 07:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
what do you mean you you you think I've
 
07:24:11.208 --> 07:24:11.218 align:start position:0%
been paid no one's paid me I got a
 
07:24:12.288 --> 07:24:12.298 align:start position:0%
little bit of money for the insurance
 
07:24:14.270 --> 07:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
company well that was supposed to go
 
07:24:16.548 --> 07:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
towards the ambulance it and that is
 
07:24:18.590 --> 07:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
very confusing it's very distressing for
 
07:24:21.170 --> 07:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
them it's distressing for us too
 
07:24:23.330 --> 07:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
um because we don't want to to be
 
07:24:24.708 --> 07:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
putting patients who are already in
 
07:24:26.690 --> 07:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
difficult situation into an even worse
 
07:24:26.700 --> 07:24:27.890 align:start position:0%
difficult situation into an even worse
situation

07:24:27.890 --> 07:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
situation
 
07:24:31.368 --> 07:24:31.378 align:start position:0%
but at the same time there is a real
 
07:24:32.628 --> 07:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
cost to the service they've been
 
07:24:35.810 --> 07:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
provided we work with the um we work
 
07:24:37.548 --> 07:24:37.558 align:start position:0%
with the patients if they're unable to
 
07:24:40.730 --> 07:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
pay their bills themselves we do have a
 
07:24:43.750 --> 07:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
connection with the hospital's Financial
 
07:24:46.190 --> 07:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
program Financial I'm sorry I'm very
 
07:24:47.510 --> 07:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
tired now
 
07:24:49.010 --> 07:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
um we do have a we have a connection
 
07:24:51.468 --> 07:24:51.478 align:start position:0%
with the hospital and we whatever level
 
07:24:53.690 --> 07:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
of financial grants they've been
 
07:24:55.850 --> 07:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
approved for we mirror that with the
 
07:24:57.708 --> 07:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
ambulance bill so if they've been
 
07:25:01.310 --> 07:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
granted a 75 or even 100 write-off we
 
07:25:03.530 --> 07:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
will mirror the same but whatever the
 
07:25:05.030 --> 07:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
insurance company has given them as a
 
07:25:06.410 --> 07:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
check that's supposed to go towards the
 
07:25:08.030 --> 07:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
ambulance bill we're expecting them
 
07:25:11.030 --> 07:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately to pay that to us and that
 
07:25:12.468 --> 07:25:12.478 align:start position:0%
can get uncomfortable
 
07:25:14.868 --> 07:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
so if there are any questions so the
 
07:25:17.810 --> 07:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
balance billing is in the fees so if you
 
07:25:17.820 --> 07:25:18.948 align:start position:0%
balance billing is in the fees so if you
look

07:25:18.948 --> 07:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
look
 
07:25:20.150 --> 07:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
you look shortfall
 
07:25:22.250 --> 07:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
before the show about this this is the
 
07:25:24.230 --> 07:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
fees is
 
07:25:26.270 --> 07:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
upwards so I understand but if you did
 
07:25:28.670 --> 07:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
balance Bill yes I'm sorry yes I just
 
07:25:30.170 --> 07:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that it's already in
 
07:25:32.208 --> 07:25:32.218 align:start position:0%
the 622. it's captured in there it's
 
07:25:34.190 --> 07:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
already captured yep okay
 
07:25:34.200 --> 07:25:37.010 align:start position:0%
already captured yep okay
okay

07:25:37.010 --> 07:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:39.890 --> 07:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you so much
 
07:25:41.628 --> 07:25:41.638 align:start position:0%
I'll have to take this back to our town
 
07:25:44.390 --> 07:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
and see how we're doing
 
07:25:59.690 --> 07:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:02.330 --> 07:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
good evening good evening I had a lot of
 
07:26:03.830 --> 07:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
things ready to say but most of them
 
07:26:06.048 --> 07:26:06.058 align:start position:0%
have already been said and since I my
 
07:26:08.330 --> 07:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
parking ticket ran out at four I
 
07:26:11.330 --> 07:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
probably have a parking ticket now so
 
07:26:13.968 --> 07:26:13.978 align:start position:0%
um but thank you for the opportunity to

Paula mentioned I didn't have gray hair
 
07:26:31.128 --> 07:26:31.138 align:start position:0%

07:26:33.770 --> 07:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
sure do now I'm currently employed by
 
07:26:35.628 --> 07:26:35.638 align:start position:0%

in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:26:45.948 --> 07:26:45.958 align:start position:0%
I want to just set the record straight
 
07:26:48.468 --> 07:26:48.478 align:start position:0%
if I can first there was a comment that
 
07:26:50.208 --> 07:26:50.218 align:start position:0%
was made by one of the first speakers
 
07:26:53.030 --> 07:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
here today that said that an ambulance
 
07:26:55.070 --> 07:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
service in Manchester was going out of
 
07:26:55.080 --> 07:26:56.090 align:start position:0%
service in Manchester was going out of
business

07:26:56.090 --> 07:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
business
 
07:26:58.250 --> 07:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
we are the only Ambulance Service in
 
07:27:00.170 --> 07:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
Manchester we are not going out of
 
07:27:01.968 --> 07:27:01.978 align:start position:0%
business we have no plans to go out of
 
07:27:04.430 --> 07:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
business we I I don't know where that
 
07:27:07.128 --> 07:27:07.138 align:start position:0%
information is we have one in Keene that
 
07:27:09.830 --> 07:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
might be going out of business okay but
 
07:27:12.048 --> 07:27:12.058 align:start position:0%
my literally my phone has been blowing
 
07:27:15.468 --> 07:27:15.478 align:start position:0%
up since that comment was made I've got
 
07:27:18.288 --> 07:27:18.298 align:start position:0%
over 200 employees who are extremely
 
07:27:22.010 --> 07:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
concerned now and I will do my best to
 
07:27:24.110 --> 07:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
address that and that it means that many
 
07:27:26.448 --> 07:27:26.458 align:start position:0%
people are watching us today uh well you
 
07:27:27.890 --> 07:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
know it's a texting world so people
 
07:27:29.690 --> 07:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
people text it
 
07:27:32.030 --> 07:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
one other point I wanted to make on a
 
07:27:33.530 --> 07:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
comment that was made by that same
 
07:27:36.948 --> 07:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
speaker was Congress did reauthorize a
 
07:27:40.250 --> 07:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
23 temporary boost to the super rural
 
07:27:42.650 --> 07:27:42.660 align:start position:0%
which really only affects the 45th
 
07:27:46.010 --> 07:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
parallel in in our state of Medicare
 
07:27:46.020 --> 07:27:47.150 align:start position:0%
parallel in in our state of Medicare
payments

07:27:47.150 --> 07:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
payments
 
07:27:50.330 --> 07:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
and that's not a new 23 that's an
 
07:27:53.330 --> 07:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
extension of an existing 23 kicker for
 
07:27:56.030 --> 07:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
those folks and a much less one for all
 
07:27:57.530 --> 07:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
other ambulance services that was
 
07:27:59.750 --> 07:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
something that was industry-wide really
 
07:28:01.310 --> 07:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
would have decimated ambulance services
 
07:28:03.890 --> 07:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
across the country and Congress was able
 
07:28:06.590 --> 07:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
to uh Stave that off for an additional
 
07:28:10.490 --> 07:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
two years now I I agree with everything
 
07:28:13.208 --> 07:28:13.218 align:start position:0%
that Chief best and his
 
07:28:17.048 --> 07:28:17.058 align:start position:0%
colleagues said it makes absolute sense
 
07:28:20.510 --> 07:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
that we allow the center for Medicare
 
07:28:23.448 --> 07:28:23.458 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid services to complete their
 
07:28:25.850 --> 07:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
five-year cost study and that's a
 
07:28:27.468 --> 07:28:27.478 align:start position:0%
national cost study we're halfway
 
07:28:29.930 --> 07:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
through it to determine what the actual
 
07:28:32.330 --> 07:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
cost of ambulance service is in every
 
07:28:35.030 --> 07:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
state in the country that's an enormous
 
07:28:37.070 --> 07:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
process to go through
 
07:28:39.650 --> 07:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
as a part of the no surprises act which
 
07:28:41.868 --> 07:28:41.878 align:start position:0%
people have mentioned there is also a
 
07:28:43.968 --> 07:28:43.978 align:start position:0%
federal ambulance balance billing
 
07:28:46.190 --> 07:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee that has been formed and I'm
 
07:28:47.810 --> 07:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
actually proud to say that senator
 
07:28:50.208 --> 07:28:50.218 align:start position:0%
suprentice from Lebanon New Hampshire is
 
07:28:52.310 --> 07:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
on that committee she represents the
 
07:28:54.948 --> 07:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
insurance Regulators that committee is
 
07:28:57.590 --> 07:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
tasked with reporting back to Congress
 
07:29:01.310 --> 07:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
within 180 days of their first meeting
 
07:29:05.270 --> 07:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
of offering a solution for Congress to
 
07:29:07.430 --> 07:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
finally settle this on a national level
 
07:29:10.368 --> 07:29:10.378 align:start position:0%
once and for all what wasn't mentioned
 
07:29:12.948 --> 07:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
earlier was that air ambulance was also
 
07:29:16.368 --> 07:29:16.378 align:start position:0%
excluded from the no surprises act yep
 
07:29:17.990 --> 07:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
but they're only fifty thousand dollars
 
07:29:18.000 --> 07:29:20.390 align:start position:0%
but they're only fifty thousand dollars
right

07:29:20.390 --> 07:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:29:23.030 --> 07:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
the same process was done with air
 
07:29:25.070 --> 07:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
ambulance that's currently being done
 
07:29:27.288 --> 07:29:27.298 align:start position:0%
with ground ambulance and that situation
 
07:29:29.810 --> 07:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
was solved there are no more surprise
 
07:29:32.270 --> 07:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
bills for air ambulance a group of
 
07:29:34.368 --> 07:29:34.378 align:start position:0%
stakeholders met they determined what
 
07:29:36.530 --> 07:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
the actual costs were they came up with
 
07:29:38.750 --> 07:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
a methodology that was felt to be fair
 
07:29:41.330 --> 07:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
to both sides and they implemented it I
 
07:29:42.890 --> 07:29:42.900 align:start position:0%
have every confidence that that will
 
07:29:44.930 --> 07:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
happen on a federal level
 
07:29:47.030 --> 07:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
with ground Ambulance Service as well
 
07:29:49.368 --> 07:29:49.378 align:start position:0%
you've heard today from all of my
 
07:29:52.968 --> 07:29:52.978 align:start position:0%
colleagues that this is not a simple fix
 
07:29:56.570 --> 07:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
by any means one thing I will say
 
07:29:59.090 --> 07:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
however is that it's pretty clear to me
 
07:30:01.788 --> 07:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
that the tactic being used currently by
 
07:30:04.310 --> 07:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
the insurance carriers to send the check
 
07:30:05.628 --> 07:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
to the patient
 
07:30:08.990 --> 07:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
isn't helping to get anybody in network
 
07:30:12.170 --> 07:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
it's been 10 plus years since that
 
07:30:16.788 --> 07:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
started and as far as I know we are the
 
07:30:20.270 --> 07:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
only one in network with Anthem I
 
07:30:21.590 --> 07:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
actually don't remember it that way I
 
07:30:24.048 --> 07:30:24.058 align:start position:0%
remember it was always sent to the page
 
07:30:28.070 --> 07:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
that we added May right send it to you
 
07:30:30.708 --> 07:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
yeah well in New Hampshire we are
 
07:30:32.750 --> 07:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
anthems Network I'm not aware of anybody
 
07:30:35.208 --> 07:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
behind me that's in anthem's network and
 
07:30:36.590 --> 07:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
we do it for a variety of different
 
07:30:38.810 --> 07:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
reasons we're a national company we work
 
07:30:41.150 --> 07:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
with Anthem across the company or across
 
07:30:43.610 --> 07:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
the country so it's a strategic decision
 
07:30:45.410 --> 07:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
for us what is the name of your company
 
07:30:47.330 --> 07:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry American Medical Response
 
07:30:51.230 --> 07:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
you're the AMR okay okay cool
 
07:30:53.750 --> 07:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
is and I want to respond to as far as
 
07:30:55.250 --> 07:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
the cities go
 
07:30:57.708 --> 07:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
um I would argue that we are not as well
 
07:31:00.590 --> 07:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
funded in the cities because most of our
 
07:31:03.048 --> 07:31:03.058 align:start position:0%
patients are on Medicaid
 
07:31:06.410 --> 07:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
and most of the other most part of our
 
07:31:08.448 --> 07:31:08.458 align:start position:0%
patients are Indigent and have no
 
07:31:11.330 --> 07:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
insurance at all in fact last year I'm
 
07:31:14.090 --> 07:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
happy to say that we were able to get
 
07:31:16.368 --> 07:31:16.378 align:start position:0%
the legislature to increase the Medicaid
 
07:31:18.410 --> 07:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
rates for ground ambulance in the state
 
07:31:20.208 --> 07:31:20.218 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire for the first time
 
07:31:23.510 --> 07:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
since 2005.
 
07:31:26.270 --> 07:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
now we're at 50 in this state right now
 
07:31:29.150 --> 07:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
of what Medicare currently pays
 
07:31:31.490 --> 07:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
ambulance services our neighboring
 
07:31:34.670 --> 07:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
states Maine is at 100 percent
 
07:31:37.128 --> 07:31:37.138 align:start position:0%
um Vermont I believe is at 82 percent
 
07:31:41.090 --> 07:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts is at 72 percent so we
 
07:31:43.490 --> 07:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
have a ways to go if there's a solution
 
07:31:45.590 --> 07:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's immediate that's going to make an
 
07:31:47.570 --> 07:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
impact on everybody behind me from
 
07:31:50.270 --> 07:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
for-profits to non-profits it's to raise
 
07:31:52.010 --> 07:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
the State Medicaid rate for ground
 
07:31:54.230 --> 07:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
ambulance services to a reasonable level
 
07:31:56.810 --> 07:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
and that's why hasn't our congressional
 
07:32:00.048 --> 07:32:00.058 align:start position:0%
district fix this problem that's a state
 
07:32:02.510 --> 07:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's actually a state rate right but
 
07:32:04.730 --> 07:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
it's state but it's a federal or you say
 
07:32:06.948 --> 07:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
Medicare or Medicaid Medicaid a Medicaid
 
07:32:08.750 --> 07:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
yes Medicaid yeah don't forget that
 
07:32:10.730 --> 07:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
money so I'm hopeful and we've worked
 
07:32:13.490 --> 07:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
with director Lipman at um uh at
 
07:32:15.350 --> 07:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and hoping that he's put that
 
07:32:17.090 --> 07:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
in the budget for this year but that
 
07:32:20.030 --> 07:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
would be a a very meaningful uh have a
 
07:32:22.368 --> 07:32:22.378 align:start position:0%
very meaningful impact on on all of the
 
07:32:25.010 --> 07:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
ambulance services in this state as well
 
07:32:28.730 --> 07:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
so I oppose the legislation as it
 
07:32:31.850 --> 07:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
currently is written and I certainly
 
07:32:34.010 --> 07:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
agree that patients should not be in the
 
07:32:35.390 --> 07:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
middle of a Health care billing dispute
 
07:32:38.090 --> 07:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
but as an industry we're seeking a fair
 
07:32:40.250 --> 07:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
and Equitable solution to this problem
 
07:32:44.650 --> 07:32:44.660 align:start position:0%
but this as it's written today is not it
 
07:32:47.090 --> 07:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
07:32:49.968 --> 07:32:49.978 align:start position:0%
thank you all right last but not least
 
07:32:52.250 --> 07:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
only because that guy from Tilton you
 
07:32:57.708 --> 07:32:57.718 align:start position:0%
know jumped so uh Justin then Ethan from
 
07:33:00.770 --> 07:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
Stewart's ambulance
 
07:33:02.690 --> 07:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
scrap most of my speech because we all
 
07:33:04.490 --> 07:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
want to leave here and I'll try and only
 
07:33:07.010 --> 07:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
touch on things we haven't discussed
 
07:33:08.690 --> 07:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
um one to answer your question five
 
07:33:10.250 --> 07:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
years ago there were about a dozen
 
07:33:11.990 --> 07:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
private for-profit ambulance services
 
07:33:14.810 --> 07:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
today I'm aware of three all the other
 
07:33:17.628 --> 07:33:17.638 align:start position:0%
ones have gone out of business if you
 
07:33:19.910 --> 07:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
have a Bible for me I'll put my hand on
 
07:33:22.548 --> 07:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
it we are only cash flow positive
 
07:33:25.670 --> 07:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
because of taxpayer subsidies as a
 
07:33:27.410 --> 07:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
company we're the largest rural
 
07:33:30.288 --> 07:33:30.298 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service that exists as
 
07:33:32.448 --> 07:33:32.458 align:start position:0%
everyone has mentioned
 
07:33:34.610 --> 07:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
um every other state around us is
 
07:33:37.548 --> 07:33:37.558 align:start position:0%
finding ways to funnel more money to EMS
 
07:33:40.368 --> 07:33:40.378 align:start position:0%
and this bill would eliminate funds that
 
07:33:42.770 --> 07:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
are currently going to EMS so anyways
 
07:33:45.410 --> 07:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'm Justin I live in holderness I'm the
 
07:33:46.430 --> 07:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
chairman of the board and have been for
 
07:33:47.930 --> 07:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
almost 20 years now at Stewart's I've
 
07:33:49.548 --> 07:33:49.558 align:start position:0%
also worked extensively with Cheshire
 
07:33:51.708 --> 07:33:51.718 align:start position:0%
county to help them set up their
 
07:33:53.208 --> 07:33:53.218 align:start position:0%
ambulance service with delusio
 
07:33:54.948 --> 07:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately going
 
07:33:57.048 --> 07:33:57.058 align:start position:0%
um bankrupt as I've testified despite
 
07:33:58.490 --> 07:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
the fact we're not private Equity you're
 
07:34:01.490 --> 07:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
not bankrupt yet what well the IRS he
 
07:34:03.890 --> 07:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
said that they were going to pay pay the
 
07:34:05.150 --> 07:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
bill oh
 
07:34:06.890 --> 07:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
they took that a hundred thousand
 
07:34:08.530 --> 07:34:08.540 align:start position:0%
hundred whatever is 100
 
07:34:11.090 --> 07:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
they said they were going to pay it my
 
07:34:13.128 --> 07:34:13.138 align:start position:0%
mistake I hadn't seen that so
 
07:34:14.448 --> 07:34:14.458 align:start position:0%
um hopefully they won't they won't
 
07:34:16.368 --> 07:34:16.378 align:start position:0%
follow the likes of American and not
 
07:34:19.670 --> 07:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
America AMR but American and uh Care
 
07:34:21.048 --> 07:34:21.058 align:start position:0%
Plus and all the other companies that
 
07:34:22.670 --> 07:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
have gone bankrupt
 
07:34:22.680 --> 07:34:24.410 align:start position:0%
have gone bankrupt
um

07:34:24.410 --> 07:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:34:26.208 --> 07:34:26.218 align:start position:0%
we're not private Equity owned despite a
 
07:34:27.288 --> 07:34:27.298 align:start position:0%
couple of reference to that we're owned
 
07:34:28.490 --> 07:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
by a wealthy philanthropist out of
 
07:34:30.170 --> 07:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh he's actually very very
 
07:34:32.030 --> 07:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
generous uh and one of the things that
 
07:34:33.650 --> 07:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
we don't do and we have not done for
 
07:34:35.628 --> 07:34:35.638 align:start position:0%
over a decade is balance build we don't
 
07:34:37.730 --> 07:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
do it it also means that we're one of
 
07:34:39.890 --> 07:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
the most expensive ambulance services in
 
07:34:41.510 --> 07:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because the way we pay for
 
07:34:43.490 --> 07:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
not balanced billing patients because we
 
07:34:45.230 --> 07:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
know patients hate billing is we charge
 
07:34:47.030 --> 07:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
insurance companies more upfront not
 
07:34:48.708 --> 07:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
everybody pays it
 
07:34:51.048 --> 07:34:51.058 align:start position:0%
um and that's really the one thing that
 
07:34:53.090 --> 07:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
I wanted to touch on with you guys today
 
07:34:55.670 --> 07:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh because it's the challenges that we
 
07:34:58.610 --> 07:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
live with is just before I left I
 
07:35:00.948 --> 07:35:00.958 align:start position:0%
grabbed 10 eobs the most recent the
 
07:35:03.708 --> 07:35:03.718 align:start position:0%
explanations of benefits payments that
 
07:35:05.868 --> 07:35:05.878 align:start position:0%
we got for ambulance transports every
 
07:35:07.610 --> 07:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
single one of these it's the exact same
 
07:35:12.128 --> 07:35:12.138 align:start position:0%
code it's 80427 it is a 9-1-1 call
 
07:35:14.810 --> 07:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
mileage is excluded from this it's just
 
07:35:16.670 --> 07:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
you know the first part so it should be
 
07:35:19.910 --> 07:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
the same for everybody that we treat
 
07:35:22.968 --> 07:35:22.978 align:start position:0%
um the average on this in the state of
 
07:35:26.468 --> 07:35:26.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire according to new Hampshire
 
07:35:28.670 --> 07:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
healthcost.nh.gov is a little over
 
07:35:31.490 --> 07:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred bucks right
 
07:35:33.170 --> 07:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
one of the largest insurance companies
 
07:35:36.410 --> 07:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire here's 10 bills four of
 
07:35:39.048 --> 07:35:39.058 align:start position:0%
them they told us the appropriate amount
 
07:35:42.170 --> 07:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
of money to to get paid averages fifteen
 
07:35:44.390 --> 07:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
hundred is four hundred and eighty
 
07:35:47.330 --> 07:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
dollars that's less than Medicare pays
 
07:35:48.948 --> 07:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
us and by the way Medicare is not
 
07:35:50.270 --> 07:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
acknowledged as being the right number I
 
07:35:52.070 --> 07:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
think Congress has all said it's paying
 
07:35:53.570 --> 07:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
less than what it cost us to run the
 
07:35:56.090 --> 07:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
service so four times out of ten they
 
07:35:58.850 --> 07:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
pay us less than Medicare and then we
 
07:36:01.968 --> 07:36:01.978 align:start position:0%
get one and it's 781 dollars well maybe
 
07:36:03.650 --> 07:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
they thought it was more expensive zip
 
07:36:05.390 --> 07:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
code okay maybe there's a little bit of
 
07:36:07.968 --> 07:36:07.978 align:start position:0%
discrepancy and then we get one they
 
07:36:11.090 --> 07:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
paid thirty two hundred dollars on again
 
07:36:13.250 --> 07:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
this is all in the last few weeks in the
 
07:36:15.288 --> 07:36:15.298 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire on the same type
 
07:36:17.868 --> 07:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
of 9-1-1 call except that thirty two
 
07:36:19.788 --> 07:36:19.798 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars they paid that check to
 
07:36:21.468 --> 07:36:21.478 align:start position:0%
the patient all the other ones they gave
 
07:36:24.590 --> 07:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
to us the next one thirty three hundred
 
07:36:26.868 --> 07:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
dollars the next one thirty five hundred
 
07:36:28.548 --> 07:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
dollars the next one thirty six hundred
 
07:36:30.048 --> 07:36:30.058 align:start position:0%
dollars the next one thirty six hundred
 
07:36:31.910 --> 07:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
dollars the next one Thirty seven
 
07:36:33.350 --> 07:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars the next one thirty six
 
07:36:35.330 --> 07:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars this is one insurance
 
07:36:38.390 --> 07:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
company in New Hampshire making payments
 
07:36:40.610 --> 07:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
in the last two weeks for the exact same
 
07:36:42.708 --> 07:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
nine one one call by the way every one
 
07:36:44.628 --> 07:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
of those ones that wasn't 400 bucks they
 
07:36:46.310 --> 07:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
sent the check to the patient and then
 
07:36:48.770 --> 07:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
they tell us on average we paid you
 
07:36:50.750 --> 07:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred dollars which is the
 
07:36:52.850 --> 07:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
state average I go no you didn't you
 
07:36:56.270 --> 07:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
paid us four hundred dollars you paid
 
07:36:58.128 --> 07:36:58.138 align:start position:0%
the patient I don't know what does that
 
07:37:00.288 --> 07:37:00.298 align:start position:0%
work out to be twenty thousand dollars
 
07:37:02.390 --> 07:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
and now we've got to chase the patient
 
07:37:04.250 --> 07:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
and we'll be lucky if we get a third of
 
07:37:06.948 --> 07:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
that once the patient is done and and
 
07:37:10.250 --> 07:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
this is the problem these games we don't
 
07:37:11.750 --> 07:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
balance Bill the patients so if somebody
 
07:37:14.868 --> 07:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
gives us 400 bucks okay great we'll bill
 
07:37:16.730 --> 07:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
you for copana optimal we have to do
 
07:37:18.948 --> 07:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
that but that's it we don't balance bill
 
07:37:20.270 --> 07:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
you and say hey your insurance company
 
07:37:21.708 --> 07:37:21.718 align:start position:0%
paid everyone else at thirty five
 
07:37:23.150 --> 07:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars so we're going to
 
07:37:24.530 --> 07:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
balance bill you the difference we don't
 
07:37:26.810 --> 07:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
and the insurance companies are taking
 
07:37:28.610 --> 07:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
advantage of this one of you asked
 
07:37:30.650 --> 07:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
what's the solution again hopefully
 
07:37:32.270 --> 07:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's smarter than me he thinks
 
07:37:34.190 --> 07:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
about this maybe it does and I don't
 
07:37:35.930 --> 07:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
like regulatory oversight but maybe it
 
07:37:37.670 --> 07:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
does need some level of regulatory
 
07:37:40.430 --> 07:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
oversight but my one concerned I spent
 
07:37:42.048 --> 07:37:42.058 align:start position:0%
20 minutes talking to the insurance
 
07:37:43.610 --> 07:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
commissioner he seems like a really nice
 
07:37:44.990 --> 07:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
guy hadn't interacted with him before
 
07:37:48.350 --> 07:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
but you talk to those folks his deputies
 
07:37:49.850 --> 07:37:49.860 align:start position:0%
and even to the commissioner they don't
 
07:37:51.530 --> 07:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
like the insurance companies I can't
 
07:37:53.510 --> 07:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
tell you how many times I heard the word
 
07:37:56.930 --> 07:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
usurus used ref you know multiple
 
07:37:58.430 --> 07:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
references that are things that are flat
 
07:38:00.948 --> 07:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
out illegal in our industry so if you're
 
07:38:03.288 --> 07:38:03.298 align:start position:0%
gonna regulate it I think you've got to
 
07:38:04.548 --> 07:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
do something with Health and Human
 
07:38:07.670 --> 07:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
Services Commissioner of safety and the
 
07:38:09.170 --> 07:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner and you bring
 
07:38:12.350 --> 07:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
together that voice that says okay wait
 
07:38:14.810 --> 07:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
a second how in God's name do you say
 
07:38:18.230 --> 07:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
1911 sandwiches worth 400 and the other
 
07:38:19.788 --> 07:38:19.798 align:start position:0%
one's worth thirty five hundred dollars
 
07:38:21.830 --> 07:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
in their three days apart because that's
 
07:38:24.530 --> 07:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
what we all deal with on a regular basis
 
07:38:26.990 --> 07:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
so that's it I'll skip the rest of it
 
07:38:28.010 --> 07:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
because I think it's all been said and
 
07:38:29.750 --> 07:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to leave so thank you
 
07:38:30.948 --> 07:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
all for your time today it's sort of
 
07:38:32.448 --> 07:38:32.458 align:start position:0%
like the lottery you never know what
 
07:38:33.708 --> 07:38:33.718 align:start position:0%
you're going to get
 
07:38:35.810 --> 07:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
it's true that's why my colleagues have
 
07:38:37.730 --> 07:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
to balance bill but
 
07:38:41.448 --> 07:38:41.458 align:start position:0%
okay I have no more cards uh and I think
 
07:38:42.948 --> 07:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
we will close the public hearing and I
 
07:38:45.288 --> 07:38:45.298 align:start position:0%
thank you all for staying and
 
07:38:47.510 --> 07:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:38:49.730 --> 07:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
thank you all thank you
 
07:39:03.310 --> 07:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
