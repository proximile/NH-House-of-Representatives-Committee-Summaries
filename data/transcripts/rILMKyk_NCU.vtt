okay welcome I'm calling the uh public
 
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
hearing to order on House Bill 558
 
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
welcome everybody and since we are on a
 
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
limited schedule this morning I'm going
 
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
to get right to calling our oh wait one
 
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
second before we do that I forgot I'm
 
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
gonna call upon uh representative Brown
 
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
to lead us in the National in the uh
 
00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
indivisible with liberty and justice for
 
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.570 align:start position:0%
indivisible with liberty and justice for
all

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody and I want to again
 
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
introduce uh representative Carroll as
 
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
the sitting and substitute for uh
 
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki while he is
 
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 align:start position:0%
with that said uh representative Ammon
 
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
you are the sponsor of the bill please
 
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.089 align:start position:0%
you are the sponsor of the bill please
introduce

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
morning science technology and energy
 
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.850 align:start position:0%
morning science technology and energy
committee

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Keith Ammon I
 
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro District 42 the
 
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
towns of New Boston Mount Vernon and
 
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.509 align:start position:0%
towns of New Boston Mount Vernon and
lineborough

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 align:start position:0%
lineborough
 
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
and in a previous term I served on the
 
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
science technology
 
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
an energy committee and I really enjoyed
 
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
the subject matter that the committee
 
00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.949 align:start position:0%
the subject matter that the committee
covers

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
covers
 
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
and so I
 
00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill five
 
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.670 align:start position:0%
House Bill five
eight

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh as you can see by the title it deals
 
00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
with electric microgrids
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
and also grid resiliency
 
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to give you a little bit of
 
00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 align:start position:0%
an overview of what the bill entails
 
00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.650 align:start position:0%
an overview of what the bill entails
and

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
just some high level thoughts about what
 
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
a microgrid is and the benefits it could
 
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.530 align:start position:0%
a microgrid is and the benefits it could
have

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 558 it allows for
 
00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
the creation of micro grid zones
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
so you can think of a microgrid Zone as
 
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
a deregulated industrial power zone so
 
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
you could imagine an area where there's
 
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
a an anchor tenant that could be a large
 
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.530 align:start position:0%
a an anchor tenant that could be a large
manufacturer

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
a consumer of power and the microgrid
 
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 align:start position:0%
allows for
 
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
direct relationship with the generator
 
00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
the power generator
 
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 align:start position:0%
uh and the bill also uh
 
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
prescribes some responsibilities if that
 
00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
microgrid were to connect interconnect
 
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
with the main power grid
 
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.990 align:start position:0%
with the main power grid
so

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an example of an independent
 
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
electricity generating area
 
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
and so in exchange the microgrid Zone
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
can assist with a traditional power grid
 
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
and balancing its energy systems
 
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
through something called demand response
 
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
you probably hear a lot about demand
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
response on this committee
 
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh the bill aims to attract new
 
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 align:start position:0%
Industries and businesses by offering a
 
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
cheaper alternative to traditional
 
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
Energy Systems and again improving grid
 
00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 align:start position:0%
resiliency and stability
 
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill the department of energy is
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
responsible for us overseeing all the
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
microgrids ensuring their ability to
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
improve grid stability resiliency
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
and factoring in clean energy production
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
microgrids are required to provide up to
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
20 percent of their power generation
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
to the traditional grid to maintain
 
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.290 align:start position:0%
to the traditional grid to maintain
stability

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
stability
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
the microgrid operator is entitled to
 
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
regular rate of return for providing
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
demand response to the traditional grid
 
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
the bill defines microgrid microgrid
 
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
zones and domain response and outlines
 
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 align:start position:0%
the processes for partitioning for micro
 
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
microgrid designation including a public
 
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
hearing and impact analysis
 
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
and it also restricts rate regulation
 
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
for those consuming electricity within
 
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
the microgrid area and prevents recovery
 
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
of costs from retail customers outside
 
00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 align:start position:0%
the microgrid zone
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
so uh it affects those that are
 
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
operating within the grid but not
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
and so there's different uh ways that
 
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
this can be deployed it could be an
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
industrial residential commercial
 
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
it could be in a university setting and
 
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
just a brief history of
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
microgrid legislation in New Hampshire
 
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
the oldest I could find was back in 2018
 
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
and just about every year we've had a
 
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.689 align:start position:0%
and just about every year we've had a
bill

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
that touched on microgrids in some way
 
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
shape or form
 
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an interest as
 
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 align:start position:0%
microgrid technology improves and gets
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
smarter and there's actually a
 
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
designation of a smart microgrid where
 
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
you have a controller can balance out
 
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
the the consumption and generation
 
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
within the microgrid and also manage the
 
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
interconnection with the rest of the
 
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
grid so
 
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.770 align:start position:0%
grid so
um

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
I uh asked the committee to please uh
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's the committee's bill at
 
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
this point and uh if there are
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
improvements I think there's several
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
people that are going to come behind me
 
00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:55.259 align:start position:0%
that will have
 
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
comments about how to improve this bill
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I'm interested in you know
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
making this the best Bill it could be
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
and uh looking for your input and I'm
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
oh sorry thank you Mr chairman and um
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
good to see you representative I miss
 
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
you being on this committee I apologize
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
for walking in late and I just want to
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
make sure that this handout is from you
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
no that's not for me I believe that's
 
00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:32.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
I see one more question uh
 
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and welcome back I
 
00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
suppose thank you representative admin
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
um so I read the bill and I have uh
 
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
quite a few questions but I'll just ask
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
them in turn when I'm recognized uh so I
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
noticed that the ideas here is that the
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
microgrid zones are initiated by the
 
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners in the county who
 
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
petition the department of energy what's
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
the rationale behind that particular
 
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
procedure yeah that's a good question
 
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
um so the County Commissioners uh
 
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.170 align:start position:0%
um so the County Commissioners uh
were

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
were giving responsibility to the County
 
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to know the particular
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh local issues that deal with their
 
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.750 align:start position:0%
uh local issues that deal with their
County

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
County
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
so a person that was interested in
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
creating a microgrid would first go to
 
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
the County Commissioners and the County
 
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
Commissioners would petition the
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
department of energy on their behalf
 
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:33.860 align:start position:0%
and so it would be some local government
 
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
oversight at least at the county level
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
so that it was a good fit for the local
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
area that was the thinking with
 
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
giving the County Commissioners that
 
00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:46.019 align:start position:0%
responsibility open to suggestions on
 
00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:50.690 align:start position:0%
responsibility open to suggestions on
that

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
I'll take one more question uh
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative muns
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question just as a as a
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a follow-up to that question
 
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.630 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a follow-up to that question
um

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
I see that there were
 
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
um there are limitations on the number
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
of micro zones in a particular County
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that it can't cross county lines and
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
then also the size of the um area has to
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
be a minimum of I believe five acres
 
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
yeah what what's the rationale for
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
putting a limit of three Per County
 
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
um it admittedly it's an arbitrary
 
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.870 align:start position:0%
um it admittedly it's an arbitrary
number

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
it's to kind of manage the the growth of
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
microgrids like obviously if
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
too many sprung up all at once we might
 
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
have issues balancing out
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
the overall Demand on the grid it was
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
just to put some brakes on
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
uh the program not rolling out too
 
00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:51.350 align:start position:0%
uh the program not rolling out too
quickly

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
and Crossing county lines just had to do
 
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
with giving responsibility to each
 
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.930 align:start position:0%
with giving responsibility to each
County

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
County
 
00:10:59.930 --> 00:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
again these are all open to suggestions
 
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459 align:start position:0%
uh you know we can modify this however
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
you see fit but it was a starting point
 
00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:08.459 align:start position:0%
to uh at least provide some minimum uh
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
size and uh some cap on the number so
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't uh we didn't have too
 
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
many unintended consequences
 
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to move on uh we have a
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
lot of speakers and so I sense uh
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
they'll be answering some of those
 
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
questions behind you representative
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony and
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
um Good Luck
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
good luck with your recovery
 
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on Mr Dennis Porter at
 
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
this point I don't know who he recommend
 
00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
who he represents he didn't put on his
 
00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:52.430 align:start position:0%
who he represents he didn't put on his
card

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
am I on there we go you're on
 
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
um well thank you chairman and committee
 
00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.310 align:start position:0%
um well thank you chairman and committee
members

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
for letting me come here to speak today
 
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
and forgive me opportunity I'd like to
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
introduce myself my name is Dennis
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
Porter I am the CEO and co-founder of
 
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:12.260 align:start position:0%
Satoshi action fund which is a
 
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
non-profit non-partisan organization
 
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
that focuses on advocating for public
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
policy at the state level
 
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
we also craft public policy to help
 
00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:28.019 align:start position:0%
States in their path to help improve
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
their energy systems
 
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
I'm here to support this policy and I
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
hope that I can share some of the
 
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
reasons why with you
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
we believe that this policy will help
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
to decrease its energy prices
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
grow carbon free energy in the state and
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
other energy projects
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
that it will drive local investment
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
and create jobs especially in the North
 
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.410 align:start position:0%
and create jobs especially in the North
country

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
while also improving grid stability and
 
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
resiliency throughout the state and
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
within New England ISO
 
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.190 align:start position:0%
within New England ISO
uh

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
one of the major factors when you're
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
considering job growth today is how to
 
00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459 align:start position:0%
attract new businesses and new
 
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
manufacturing to your state
 
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
and one of the most important factors
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
for new industry and
 
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:25.820 align:start position:0%
new manufacturing is the price of power
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire and across New
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
England ISO the price of power is
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat unreasonable for most new
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturing to take foothold
 
00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
also traditional Energy Systems today
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
are not well equipped to help the state
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire overcome
 
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:47.420 align:start position:0%
this roadblock so we believe that
 
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
microgrids can help by providing a
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
unique solution
 
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
are in A New Path for New Hampshire to
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
be able to overcome this roadblock and
 
00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
attract New Generation while avoiding
 
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
the traditional costs that may be overly
 
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.769 align:start position:0%
the traditional costs that may be overly
burdensome

00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
burdensome
 
00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
in order for a new manufacturer or a new
 
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
job Creator to come to the state this is
 
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
done by creating microgrids that will be
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
within these microgrid zones
 
00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of them is to help new
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and energy producers to
 
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
work in tandem
 
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
the product of this policy and the
 
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
implementation of it will be more
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
business and more jobs here in the state
 
00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
but that's not the only positive
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
component that microgrids can offer
 
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
through this policy
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
once connected to the traditional energy
 
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the state of New
 
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.470 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the state of New
Hampshire

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
these microgrids can also balance and
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
act as an emergency Reserve System
 
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
during Peak demand
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
this will help to keep prices down
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
during Peak Demand by increasing the
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
available Supply to ratepayers and the
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
traditional energy infrastructure
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
and it will also reduce the need for
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
costly and often carbon intensive
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
electrical infrastructure that is used
 
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
to support the grid during these Peak
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
demand moments as you all saw recently
 
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
microgrids are not a relatively New
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
Concept they have been around for
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
decades but they are growing in
 
00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:25.019 align:start position:0%
popularity as States and regions look
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
for new ways to reduce their energy
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
prices in order to attract new business
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
a similar policy was introduced and
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
passed and implemented in the state of
 
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
West Virginia
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
in September
 
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
that state was able to attract new
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
generation and a 500 million dollar
 
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.750 align:start position:0%
generation and a 500 million dollar
investment

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
investment
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
to a rural area of the state
 
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now faces a similar
 
00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
opportunity only this policy goes a step
 
00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
further to ensure that all rate payers
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
and all buyers of power benefit from the
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
growth of microgrids here in the state
 
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not they reside
 
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
within the micrograder microgrid Zone
 
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.250 align:start position:0%
within the micrograder microgrid Zone
itself

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
this is accomplished by providing the
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
downward pressure on rates through the
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
demand response component that is
 
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
included within this policy and is the
 
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
one major differentiating factor from
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
the microgrid policy that was passed in
 
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
West Virginia and implemented there in
 
00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.019 align:start position:0%
that state
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
there are various other positive
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
benefits from US policy and I'm happy to
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
go over them with you but I would urge
 
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote Yes on this bill
 
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for your time and happy
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions you might have
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Powers good presentation
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
welcome and I'll open up to a couple of
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
short questions uh representative
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
Reynolds thank you Mr chairman
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
um what are the fuels that are
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
envisioned uh that might be used and you
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
know the Technologies and the fuels
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
what's going to fuel these microgrids
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
it's a great question rep Reynolds thank
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
you so much for that
 
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
um it's an important question to
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
consider when you're talking about the
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
growth of microgrids what type of fuels
 
00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
might be considered or used we you know
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
we believe that we should be somewhat uh
 
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
Tech neutral or Tech agnostic or energy
 
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
agnostic in the growth of these systems
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
and that you know the implementation
 
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
should be left up to the Department of
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
energy and and the states that make the
 
00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:26.579 align:start position:0%
decisions on what type of fuel source
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
should be used
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
the policy does though take a look and
 
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
consider you know what type of fuel
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
source will be used in the
 
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative Noel please
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
my question is is there an is there an
 
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
interconnection problem for a microgrid
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
is there some additional equipment that
 
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
needs to be brought in to define the
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
microgrid that's a excellent question
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
rep no and and thank you for asking it
 
00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
because we specifically lay out the
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
interconnection process in the policy
 
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.090 align:start position:0%
interconnection process in the policy
itself

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:05.950 align:start position:0%
itself
um

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
microgrids are typically plagued with
 
00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299 align:start position:0%
two major problems one is that in order
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
to deal with the excess or lack of
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
energy on a microgrid they have to
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
acquire a great interconnection
 
00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
unfortunately grid interconnections are
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive and are plagued with
 
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden and take a significant
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
amount of time so oftentimes microgrids
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
do not get built however with the Advent
 
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:34.820 align:start position:0%
of high density flexible loads
 
00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:36.919 align:start position:0%
microgrids can become somewhat
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
self-regulatory or self-efficient and
 
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
they do not require a grid
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
interconnection as was typically
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
important in the past for those systems
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
to operate functionally
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
and so now the policy recognizes the
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
Advent of these new technologies
 
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
and lays out a path where those that
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
want to build the microgrid and new
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
generation and attract new jobs and
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
investment can do so once they build the
 
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
microgrid or once they start to apply
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
for it they must apply for grid
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
interconnection to be connected to the
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
main grid but they're not required to
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
have that Grid interconnection at the
 
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
moment they start building their
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
operations however if they're as at some
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
point a grid interconnection that does
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
get built uh you know the the
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
the grid itself the microgrid itself
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
would have to perform demand response
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
back to the traditional grid and that's
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
where the component of grid resiliency
 
00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:34.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative Harrington for our
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
last question
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you chairman thank you for
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I won't actually
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
ask a question other than who can I
 
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
speak to about the bill because I have
 
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
so many questions on this that it would
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
take me an hour to go through them right
 
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
now so who's the right person to talk to
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
after this so I can answer my questions
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
I think uh that's a great question yeah
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
there's a probably several people that
 
00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
would be good to talk to are you happy
 
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
to stay afterwards and discuss with you
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
and I think also rep representative
 
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
Ammon and then you know various other
 
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
people like my policy director if you
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
need really narrowed down details you
 
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
know I'm happy to put you in touch with
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
him as well thank you because there's a
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
lot of terms in here that I'm not
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with they seem to be very
 
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
generic and not applicable necessarily
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire I'm happy to take
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
the time to answer any questions you
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
might have
 
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Cena with further questions
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony Mr Powers
 
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for staying around to
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
answer other questions Offline that
 
00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:31.220 align:start position:0%
would be great and I think uh
 
00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:33.299 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington may have a
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
maybe a good uh straight man because the
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
next person I'm going to ask to come up
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
here is uh Mr Griffin Rovers from the
 
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
doe and he may have some answers to some
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Thomas members of the
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record Griffin
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
rober's State energy program manager at
 
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:01.580 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of energy
 
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral on the bill
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
um as the bill analysis Notes
 
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
establishes The Authority for and
 
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
procedures for uh adoption of electric
 
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.310 align:start position:0%
procedures for uh adoption of electric
microgrids

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
microgrids
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
given some of the questions that the
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee has asked here today I think
 
00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
the department would respectfully be in
 
00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
the same camp we would very much welcome
 
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to talk to the Bill's
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
sponsors and any supporters about the
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
intent of this language as there are
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
some very large and basic questions that
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
have not been fully resolved and talking
 
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
with uh folks in our regulatory Support
 
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
Division there was some observations
 
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
that maybe this bill might fit well in
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
other states but is not necessarily
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
suited to the way New Hampshire's
 
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
electric utility utilities are
 
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.090 align:start position:0%
electric utility utilities are
structured

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
structured
 
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:47.630 align:start position:0%
structured
um

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
some of the observations that we know is
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
that uh some several of the definitions
 
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
on page one
 
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
um seem rather loose and might welcome
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
some further specificity
 
00:21:59.810 --> 00:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
um I know an earlier question was asked
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
about the rationale for microgrid zones
 
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
being minimized to an area set at five
 
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
acres we are not aware of the rationale
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
for that I think we'd welcome the
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to understand that
 
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
who controls the microgrid who oversees
 
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
the Opera the microgrids operation how
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
does it work with the local electric
 
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
distribution utility whether that be
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
unitel Liberty or eversource I know that
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's a definition of microgrid
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
operator in there but um I think we view
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
the definition of microgrid operator is
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
quite broad
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
there is a role for the county to play
 
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
um in petitioning the department to get
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
a microgrid Zone
 
00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
um approved but does the county have any
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
role following that that process does it
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
fall to the municipal penalties do they
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
have any role in it those are areas that
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
I think would be welcomed as well most
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
significantly I think the department
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
would certainly require additional
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
resources in order to implement the
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
provisions of this statute
 
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.350 align:start position:0%
provisions of this statute
um

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
per page two you'll see that our bottom
 
00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
of page one and top of page two the
 
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.409 align:start position:0%
department of energy
um

00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
is the body where where counties will
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
petition to approve these microgrid
 
00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:18.350 align:start position:0%
petition to approve these microgrid
zones

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
zones
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
um lines three to five on page two
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
indicate that the department of energy
 
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
energy shall complete an analysis of the
 
00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%
potential impact the microgrid Zone
 
00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
might have on retail customers we view
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
potential impact as quite broad
 
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:36.740 align:start position:0%
what exactly is the department vetting
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
with these microgrid proposals again
 
00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:42.059 align:start position:0%
further specificity over there would be
 
00:23:42.059 --> 00:23:43.090 align:start position:0%
further specificity over there would be
welcomed

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:43.100 align:start position:0%
welcomed
 
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
we do not anticipate that reviewing
 
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
these petitions will be easy we realize
 
00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
that there will be a level of complexity
 
00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
so I think we anticipate that additional
 
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
Staffing Resources would be needed
 
00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.770 align:start position:0%
Staffing Resources would be needed
um

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.330 align:start position:0%
um
additionally

00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
um some in our department highlights
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
some cyber security concerns the bill
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
makes no reference to any type of cyber
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
security provisions such as who protects
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
the microgrid how is it protected those
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
types of things those are just some of
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
the questions that we have internally in
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
the department and again we'd welcome
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak with the Bill's
 
00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:21.299 align:start position:0%
sponsors about it and uh with that I'm
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
more than willing to answer any
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
questions the committee might have thank
 
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
you Mr Roberts uh I'll call on
 
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
representative Munds please
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
coming back again on this beautiful
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
Monday yes yes
 
00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:35.870 align:start position:0%
Monday yes yes
um

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
I I had a lot of questions as well and
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
and one of the questions I had and I
 
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if you
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
um uh have the same question or were you
 
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
able to to to figure out or have an
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
answer to my question the prices that
 
00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:51.539 align:start position:0%
the microgrid would charge its customers
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
are those gonna are those regulated
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
um under as uh as far as I understand
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
there aren't any approved micro grids in
 
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
utilities work with on a regular basis
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
as they go on and off the grid so I
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
think it'd be premature to maybe ask
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
that question I I don't necessarily have
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
an answer for that just because we don't
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
really have a lot of case examples here
 
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr oberge for your
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
testimony uh you're accused thank you
 
00:25:24.769 --> 00:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to call on Mr Michael
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Michael Licata
 
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
representing eversource energy uh I'll
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
try not to be duplicative I think we
 
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
have a number of the same concerns as
 
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:51.260 align:start position:0%
the department of energy laid out
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to to testify
 
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:57.539 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sponsors uh filing this
 
00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:01.460 align:start position:0%
legislation we are opposed as written
 
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
but we are certainly supportive of the
 
00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:06.740 align:start position:0%
development of microgrids
 
00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059 align:start position:0%
microgrids can can actually be quite
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
useful to both the end user as well as
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
the utility they can be used to increase
 
00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:18.299 align:start position:0%
reliability uh they can be used to
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
reduce cost versus more traditional
 
00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:24.299 align:start position:0%
wired alternatives to improve resiliency
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
in a specific area
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
eversource by way of background we
 
00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
actually have a bit of
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
experience in the development of
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
microgrids in Massachusetts we actually
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
got a approval and brought online a
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
microgrid system a battery storage
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
system in place of a transmission
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
upgrade for Province Town at the edge at
 
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
the edge of the cape that was a 25 just
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
under 25 megawatt battery storage system
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
that again functions to improve local
 
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
reliability in New Hampshire folks might
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
recall that we actually proposed a 1.7
 
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
megawatt battery in Westmoreland that we
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
did not get approval for but it would
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
have been a similar type of concept
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
um we are concerned with the broad scope
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
of the bill it's not clear to us exactly
 
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
how this would interact with existing
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
state statutes specifically around Net
 
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
metering and group net metering which
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
allows for multiple entities to
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
participate in a single generation
 
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.630 align:start position:0%
participate in a single generation
installation

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
installation
 
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
we would also note as Mr Roberts noted
 
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
it would be a significant expansion of
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
the Doe's current role really in the put
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
them in the role of of almost a grid
 
00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
operator in terms of reviewing the
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
engineering and design and interaction
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
between these micro grids and the
 
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
utilities and it's really unclear how
 
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
the utility based upon this the language
 
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
would would be interacting with the doe
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
when these grids were were proposed the
 
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
review that would be required of the
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
Department of energy presumably would be
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
utility engineering and design so how we
 
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
would would inform them interact with
 
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
them about uh our system where the the
 
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:30.140 align:start position:0%
microgrid was proposed
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
that said as I started we do have
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
experience in microgrid development we
 
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
do think that there's there's value in
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
some of the concepts in the bill we
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
would be happy to work with the bill
 
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
sponsor and other stakeholders there's a
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
lot here and you know would politely
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
suggest perhaps retaining this
 
00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:54.419 align:start position:0%
legislation to get worked on in a more
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive fashion might be a good
 
00:28:59.690 --> 00:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
outcome and with that be happy to answer
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
 
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.590 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
have

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
representative uh public Corman please
 
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
again Mr locata I'm referring
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
specifically to page 3 Lines 19 through
 
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.130 align:start position:0%
specifically to page 3 Lines 19 through
21.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:21.419 align:start position:0%
which says if utilities are unwilling or
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
incapable of funding the grid
 
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
interconnection microgrid operators May
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
fund the connection at which point the
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
microgrid operator will be exempt from
 
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
any cost to maintain their connection uh
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you interpret this the
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
same way as I do which is that the
 
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419 align:start position:0%
utilities might say no we don't really
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
want to fund this interconnection The
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
microgrid Operators connect and then the
 
00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
utility is on the hook to maintain it is
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
is that how you interpret it
 
00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:52.669 align:start position:0%
is that how you interpret it
um

00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
potentially I I think that's it's sort
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
of a good example of where the bill
 
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
could use a bit more clarity so the way
 
00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419 align:start position:0%
it works right now is if someone is
 
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
installing generation storage the
 
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
utility does an engineering evaluation
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
of that interconnection and
 
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
interconnection study
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
if there are costs associated with uh
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
upgrading the local distribution system
 
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
at that location based upon that
 
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
engineering study the developer who who
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
is proposing it is required to pay for
 
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
that so that the cost is not sort of
 
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
socialized to to all customers so that's
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
how it works today
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
this contemplates that the utilities
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
would be unwilling or incapable of
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
funding the grid interconnection which
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
again is not how it works currently and
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
then after that it's it's a little
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're a little unclear but certainly
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
what you're suggesting could be a
 
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299 align:start position:0%
potential outcome of that language
 
00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:06.539 align:start position:0%
sorry if that's not particularly
 
00:31:06.539 --> 00:31:08.350 align:start position:0%
sorry if that's not particularly
Direct

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
Direct
 
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for your
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing no others questions I
 
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
will now call on a Mr Joseph kowasnik
 
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:22.029 align:start position:0%
will now call on a Mr Joseph kowasnik
please

00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
272. oh my apologies I got mixed into
 
00:31:26.529 --> 00:31:26.539 align:start position:0%
this okay
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
in that case I'll call on Mr uh Sam
 
00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
Evans Brown from clean energy New
 
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:40.250 align:start position:0%
Evans Brown from clean energy New
Hampshire

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee uh
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Sam Evans Brown I'm
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
the executive director of clean energy
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
um we uh are neutral on the bill and as
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
as written I think uh folks have
 
00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
spotlighted already some of the some of
 
00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
the questions that I had when when this
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
came across my my desk but similarly to
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
eversource I just want to uh say that we
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
are very supportive of the concept of
 
00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:03.539 align:start position:0%
developing microgrids be very happy to
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
work on this bill to try to try to make
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
it better
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
um we you've heard a bit already about
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
the the prospect of using these type of
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
Investments uh as as so-called non-wires
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
Alternatives if you're not familiar with
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
that term the idea is that utilities as
 
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
a as as it stands uh as load grows in a
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
given area the the standard response is
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
to build out new uh transmission and
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
distribution infrastructure that are
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
poles and wires that you know poles
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
wires and Transformers the types of
 
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
things that we're all very familiar with
 
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
but as the technological landscape
 
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
changes there's the opportunity to use
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
some of these newer technologies that
 
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
are in fact invested in by customers and
 
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
are customer cited to avoid those those
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
Investments and lower the cost of the
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
grid overall and I think that really is
 
00:32:51.649 --> 00:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
uh ought to be the The Guiding star when
 
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
considering how to establish a microgrid
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
program and I think that that this bill
 
00:32:57.769 --> 00:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
maybe doesn't quite get there but but
 
00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
it's there's there's some really great
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
ideas in here that we can that we can
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
work with with the sponsor to try to try
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your short testimony uh
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:33:15.289 --> 00:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call him representative
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
Brown for a question
 
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
could you clarify that for me a little
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
bit more about the non-wired piece
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere there has to be wires right
 
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
sure yeah so so my my favorite story
 
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
about this is on from the Boothbay
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
peninsula in Maine uh which which uh if
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
anyone's been to Boothbay is a lovely
 
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
little town that's that's chock full of
 
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
art galleries and tourism attractions
 
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and was experiencing substantial load
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
growth and so uh CMP the you know
 
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
Central Maine Power the utility there
 
00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:46.019 align:start position:0%
wanted to extend a new power line down
 
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
to Boothbay that was going to cost
 
00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the neighborhood of 18
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
um a a small startup uh proposed an
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
alternative proposal that said Hey what
 
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
if we could do the same thing which is
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
deliver the the the you know the what
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
the service is the electricity provides
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
but for Less cost and their proposal
 
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.430 align:start position:0%
but for Less cost and their proposal
included

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
um citing storage down at the end of the
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
peninsula battery storage it included
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
investing aggressively in efficiency so
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
they installed LED lighting and all the
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
little coin art gallery freeze down on
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
the on the tip of the peninsula
 
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
installed uh um they also installed
 
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
thermal storage so that we were refer to
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
as ice bear air conditioners that make
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
ice at night and then just blow a fan
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
over the ice during the day so it's it's
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
a way to do thermal storage as opposed
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
to using air conditioning and then you
 
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
know evaluated the costs of all those
 
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
interventions when the pilot was done
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
this is a pilot program the cost was
 
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the order on the order of
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
1.8 million dollars and avoided an 18
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
million dollar transmission line upgrade
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
so that's the non-wild wires alternative
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
can can look like a lot of things
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
anything that reduces demand can avoid
 
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
the need to invest in in new
 
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
infrastructure but it can also look like
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
traditional small scale generation cited
 
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
with you know industrial industrial
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
purposes as was as the the sponsor
 
00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.370 align:start position:0%
purposes as was as the the sponsor
described

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
um representative Reynolds question
 
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Sam thanks for
 
00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339 align:start position:0%
bringing up describing that that real
 
00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
world example uh is there a report
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
online somewhere a case study that was
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
written about that so so folks could
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
read yeah the main Public Utilities
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
Commission did uh has studied that
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
because because it was a pilot
 
00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
initiative there's been extensive sort
 
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
of reporting and study of it and I'd be
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
oop thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
um what's the difference between a
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
how'd that happen uh quite a lot uh so
 
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
so group net metering is uh what results
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
when you have a a uh behind the meter
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
generation asset that is partially
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
offsetting the load of a customer but
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
then also allowed to export its power
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
out onto the grid and uh and is then
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
resold by you know essentially resold by
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
the utility it's a little more
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
complicated than that but but that's
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
that the general Arrangement
 
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
um a a microgrid's quite a bit more
 
00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
complex it typically has the ability to
 
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
Island which is to say if the power goes
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
out the the microgrid continues to
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
function whereas your standard net
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
metering host does not
 
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
um and and similarly uh you know
 
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
microgrids can use all sorts of
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
different types of generation where
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
whereas uh group net metering typically
 
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
is is uh you know Hydro solar or small
 
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
scale wind
 
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
um in uh in Connecticut where the the
 
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
most aggressive microgrid program in New
 
00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
England is is located there's actually a
 
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
fair amount of fuel cells that are being
 
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
used for for microgrids
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
um so just to say they're they're they
 
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
really are two very separate types of
 
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
so you know the questions thank you uh
 
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
Mr Sam Evans Brown for coming here you
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
are a frequent contributor to our
 
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.130 align:start position:0%
are a frequent contributor to our
committee

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to call on the last
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
speaker of Mr Drew Armstrong and uh in
 
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
the interest of fairness to our other
 
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
speakers if you could keep your
 
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:24.260 align:start position:0%
presentation down to just a few minutes
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's okay just the sailing points do
 
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
you have any written testimony
 
00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:41.930 align:start position:0%
you have any written testimony
discussed

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
uh hey sorry
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm uh Drew Armstrong the president
 
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
and CEO of Cathedral Bitcoin uh a
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin mining company that has had
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
operations here in Northern New
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire manufacturing operations for
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
um 12 months and
 
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
Isaac fidion hello I'm the chief field
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
of operations manufacturing officer for
 
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
Cathedral Bitcoin sort of recruited
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
Cathedral Bitcoin to come into Northern
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to do manufacturing there
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
so we've been building our mobile
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
modular data centers we call them Rovers
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
up in Northern New Hampshire and working
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
with lots of other local business up
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
there to to do that we have a contractor
 
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
model so we use local electricians uh
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
local Steel Workers what have you so
 
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
Tom I'm a New Hampshire native born and
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
raised and I'm excited about the
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
potential to bring jobs to New Hampshire
 
00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and so representative those we will
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
keep it quite brief uh but I just wanted
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
to offer a uh called business
 
00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
perspective for what microgrids and what
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
this legislation could mean
 
00:38:47.569 --> 00:38:47.579 align:start position:0%
um at Cathedral Bitcoin we believe
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
that's sound money and abundant energy
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
are the keys to human flourishing and in
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
fact we believe all wealth creation
 
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
requires energy as an input and there's
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
no uh it's an inevitable aspect of
 
00:38:58.849 --> 00:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
wealth creation Now I think the main
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
benefits that microgrids can offer
 
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
especially a state like New Hampshire is
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
the ability to improve energy improve
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
the energy system over time through
 
00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
allowing pockets of experimentation
 
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
whether that's new forms of generations
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
say like small modular reactors or uh
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
potentially unlocking the role that
 
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin mining can play as a um you know
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
dispatchable load that can help improve
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
grid resiliency uh help support base
 
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
load generation uh and potentially
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
provide new ways to uh create jobs uh
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
and Industry up in um
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
States like New Hampshire particularly
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh you know one of the things
 
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
that we've been working on quite extent
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
oh sorry about that one of the things
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
we've been working on quite extensively
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
is the ability to load shed so I come
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
from a company prior to this called
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
Great American Mining and we developed
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
some prototype modular data centers and
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
the primary purpose of those was to take
 
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
advantage of wasted flare gas and oil
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
and gas industry so
 
00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:07.619 align:start position:0%
you go out and you have this multi-story
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
flame burning 24 7 it's not being used
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
for anything uh anything productive it's
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
just pollution and waste and so we would
 
00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:16.619 align:start position:0%
go out to those sites capture the gas
 
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
clean it up and use that as a fuel input
 
00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:23.099 align:start position:0%
to power these mobile data centers and
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
one of the limitations of that is you
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
need to be able to shed load quickly if
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's a gas loss and this kind of take
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
on generation where you can respond to
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
the availability of power is something
 
00:40:40.609 --> 00:40:40.619 align:start position:0%
that we believe could be quite useful to
 
00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
ISO New England in general where you
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
could have these uh what we have
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
designed these modular data centers they
 
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
could shed load quite rapidly within a
 
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
second so if you're in a peak demand
 
00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
period instead of turning on a bunch of
 
00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.810 align:start position:0%
period instead of turning on a bunch of
oil

00:40:58.810 --> 00:40:58.820 align:start position:0%
oil
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
powered generation you could just shed
 
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
load quite quickly and that could
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
provide stability to the grid and to
 
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
lower costs and reduce carbon emissions
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:13.460 align:start position:0%
and so just to conclude we think that
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
legislation like this that supports and
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
promotes micro grids and experimentation
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
within the energy system and responsible
 
00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
siled Pockets has the ability to have a
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
hugely positive impact on the grid as a
 
00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.490 align:start position:0%
hugely positive impact on the grid as a
whole

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you so much for
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
respecting the time and being able to
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
concisely State everything it was very
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
nice representative Harrington has a
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
question I'll make it short thank you Mr
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
question would you anticipate companies
 
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
like yours if this was to be passed
 
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
would take on a capacity a formal
 
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
capacity Supply obligation with ISO New
 
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:50.220 align:start position:0%
England and the forward capacity Market
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh well so I I think with this
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
legislation is uh at least from my
 
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
opinion most interesting is it allows
 
00:41:59.690 --> 00:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
for uh novel ways to
 
00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
um Design Energy Systems for example say
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
you have a series of small modular
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
reactors with capacity uh with a
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
generation capacity in excess of what uh
 
00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:10.220 align:start position:0%
the average local demand is
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
microgrids would allow for
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
experimentation where you could have
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin mining buttress that generation
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
and be a willing um call it uh demand
 
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
response partner to switch off whenever
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
the local Demand on that micro grid uh
 
00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
you know reaches near near Peak now in
 
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
terms of uh entering into a deal with
 
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
ISO New England for say a long-term PPA
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
um you know excuse me it wouldn't be a
 
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
PPA it's a capacity Supply capacity
 
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
Supply yeah Bitcoin miners could could
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely enter into the capacity
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
markets um I'm not sure if the exact uh
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
I would need to talk to the gentleman
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
from eversource and some of the other uh
 
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
folks in ISO any but Bitcoin mining
 
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
theoretically could be a participant in
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
the capacity markets yeah
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'm generally supportive of the idea of
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
microgrids technological progress it
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
sounds wonderful that
 
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
your microgrid might be able to jump in
 
00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:11.579 align:start position:0%
and supplement the Grid at periods of
 
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:13.140 align:start position:0%
peak times
 
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
but again I asked the question what do
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
you envision your microgrid being fueled
 
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
by do you intend to build especially
 
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
here in the North country
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
what's going to fuel it uh are you going
 
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
to build renewable generation
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
or what
 
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
um for the sake of uh uh leveling uh
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
expectations I don't think our company
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
is well capitalized enough to uh build
 
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
an entire micro good ourselves and to
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
find its entire microgrid ourselves that
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
said uh I I think the the generation
 
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
source that uh I think is most appealing
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
long term uh especially in the context
 
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
of microgrid uh are small modular
 
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear reactors
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
um that effectively some of them have
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to use nuclear waste as fuel
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
and help address that problem as well
 
00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
um but you know smrs and nuclear actors
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
in general typically are slow to ramp up
 
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
and down generation something like a
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
microgrid here could be perfect where
 
00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:08.339 align:start position:0%
they're able to build the reactors on
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
there on their sort of schedule are not
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
necessarily beholden to utility
 
00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:14.099 align:start position:0%
transmission build out uh and if they
 
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
have captive demands in the area on that
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
microgrid then they they have the
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
ability to serve whatever communities
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
and businesses are there with Bitcoin
 
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
mining being a tool to help help make
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
sure that was economically viable and
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
then of course if there is ever demand
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
from the grid and there is an
 
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
interconnection built
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
um obviously you know the more the the
 
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
larger the energy system is and the more
 
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
different pockets of generation it can
 
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
draw from the better it is for
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
resiliency and hopefully for Consumer
 
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
okay same well no further questions
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much a very interesting as
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact thanks for coming up
 
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
here don't be a stranger come back again
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
with that I have no other
 
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
pink slips for speakers so I will close
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 558 and ask representative
 
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
Pelosi to give the reading on the blue
 
00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:08.839 align:start position:0%
sheets and online
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
I will thank you chair uh may I get that
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
information to you later I do not have
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
it at the moment okay
 
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
um before I open up the next
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
public hearing I would just like to make
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
a rather sad announcement but a former
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
representative Gary Hopper passed away
 
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
last night after his struggle with
 
00:45:32.809 --> 00:45:32.819 align:start position:0%
cancer we just got noticed this morning
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
or yes this morning my sympathy to his
 
00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
family and friends
 
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.309 align:start position:0%
family and friends
so

00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
with that said I will open up
 
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:50.780 align:start position:0%
let's see here
 
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
370 372 and ask the prime sponsor
 
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan to come up and
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.119 --> 00:46:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and good morning
 
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
colleagues of the science technology and
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
energy committee
 
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Tony Kaplan
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
and I represent mayor Mack 8 the towns
 
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
of Henniker Bradford and Warner
 
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today to present house bill
 
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:47.809 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today to present house bill
372.

00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
372.
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
which is intended to establish a study
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
commission to look at the short and
 
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
long-term impacts of carbon pricing
 
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
mechanisms on the regional and National
 
00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:58.790 align:start position:0%
mechanisms on the regional and National
level

00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
on the people industry businesses and
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
environment of the State of New
 
00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:04.970 align:start position:0%
environment of the State of New
Hampshire

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
so I will be brief in my testimony
 
00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:08.339 align:start position:0%
because I believe that there will be
 
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
people up here subsequently who will be
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
much better place to uh
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
to give a you know a granular and
 
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
nuanced uh perspective on this issue but
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
um and brief what is carbon pricing
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing is a is a tool enacted at
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
a economy wide scale that's uh intended
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
to levelize the the playing field among
 
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
energy generating sources so that the
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
the hidden subsidy that no one pays at
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
the moment on the market for the
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
production and consumption of fossil
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
fuels is brought onto the balance sheet
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
so to speak so that people can make true
 
00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.809 align:start position:0%
so to speak so that people can make true
cost

00:47:47.809 --> 00:47:47.819 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
uh calculations and so that the least
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
cost most efficient way of doing
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
business will be the way that wins the
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
day so to speak
 
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
uh so what what are what are the what
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
are the impacts what are the hidden
 
00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
subsidies that uh at present nobody
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
really pays uh the impacts of the
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
production and consumption of fossil
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
fuels would include things like the
 
00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:11.339 align:start position:0%
human health impacts which at the
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
present and the United States has
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
calculated at 60 billion dollars a year
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
including 230 000 deaths
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
um due to the production and consumption
 
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
of fossil fuels impacts would include
 
00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
things like climate change impacts like
 
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
the destruction of crops severe weather
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
events which I think in uh 2022 alone in
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
the United States there were 18 such
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
severe weather events when the average
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
previous you know in previous decades
 
00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:41.099 align:start position:0%
has been three or four these 18 severe
 
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
weather events cost over a billion
 
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
dollars each and so what is the the
 
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
fraction attributable to the production
 
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
and consumption of fossil fuels in New
 
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's a calculation that you
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
know that economists make an
 
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
increasingly accepted by businesses and
 
00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
in governments
 
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
so what other impacts are we talking
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
about climate change refugees refugees
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
people from countries not as resilient
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
as ours where a drought or a flood means
 
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
they have one choice and that is to pack
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
up and go because their livelihoods are
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
no longer viable and their lives are at
 
00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.589 align:start position:0%
no longer viable and their lives are at
risk

00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
so all these impacts put together uh go
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
into what people call the Social cost of
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
carbon these are calculations as I said
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
they're increasingly accepted by
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
governments and businesses the EPA has a
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
has a tool the social cost of carbon
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
where they calculate that it's I think
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
roughly 190 dollars per ton of carbon
 
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
and that would take into account all the
 
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.150 align:start position:0%
and that would take into account all the
impacts

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
of the So currently a hidden subsidy for
 
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
the production and consumption of fossil
 
00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
fuels so um
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that these are calculations
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
that are already being made and widely
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
accepted makes it easier to implement
 
00:49:58.250 --> 00:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
economy-wide tools such as the carbon
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
pricing regime and we see that these are
 
00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
spreading uh around the world uh the
 
00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
European Union has a carbon pricing
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
regime it's the second or third largest
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
economy in the world and they just
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
recently announced in the last couple
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
months that they will begin enacting
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
what they call border adjustment fees
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
which is a fee on products coming across
 
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
their borders from places such as our
 
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
country that don't have carbon pricing
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
regimes which means that our products
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
are at a disadvantage China is
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
discussing this there are six provinces
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
in Canada that are currently uh
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
you know administering a carbon pricing
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
regimes inside their borders and there's
 
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
discussion at the federal level in
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
Canada certainly discussion in
 
00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
Washington especially with the Biden
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
administration's zero carbon Gold by
 
00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.190 align:start position:0%
administration's zero carbon Gold by
2050.

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
2050.
 
00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:48.059 align:start position:0%
there's a push to get to zero carbons
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
carbon neutral economy by 2050 and So
 
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
currently we see a raft of subsidies a
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
raft of mandates coming down including
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
the inflation reduction act which we're
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
all familiar with and these are all
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
intended to move us to carbon neutral
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
economy by 2050 but the experts are
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
saying that this is not going to be
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
enough it's going to be close but not
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
quite enough and so that a tool such as
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
a carbon pricing regime which is a very
 
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
simple elegant market-based tool it's
 
00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:18.059 align:start position:0%
one number it takes to the place of all
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
those mandates all those subsidies will
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
be the will be the really the the ticket
 
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
to getting us to that last mile so to
 
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
speak of getting to carbon neutral by
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
2050. so this bill is not intended to to
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
argue for a carbon pricing regime in the
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire it's saying that
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
these are these are mechanisms that are
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
spreading around the world there's a
 
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
discussion in Washington there's a
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
likelihood that this will happen and
 
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.220 align:start position:0%
that as a state as leaders of the state
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
we should be taking a look and looking
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
around and seeing what the impacts are
 
00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:50.339 align:start position:0%
on our businesses on our interests on
 
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
our people and preparing for the days
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
should it come that that we're facing a
 
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
regime like that at the federal level or
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
even a regional level we can see that to
 
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
the South the state of Massachusetts is
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
talking about it so there are individual
 
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
states as well that are looking at this
 
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
so um that's my bill in a nutshell I
 
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
will say that at the suggestion of my
 
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
colleague representative Muntz I would
 
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
like to offer an amendment uh to be
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
before you by next Thursday executive
 
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
session not next or this Thursday and
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
that would be to add two positions to
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
spots on the commission to the
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
Department of energy currently there are
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
no spots on for the Department of energy
 
00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
so that's an oversight that I think
 
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
needs to be corrected also to lengthen
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
the study period so that the current
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
date of November 2023 would be an
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
interim report and they would have an
 
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
additional year to come up with a final
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
report so those are two amendments that
 
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
I think will be before you on Thursday
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
and if there's any other ideas that come
 
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
out of the discussion today I'd be happy
 
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
to work with those
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
um I will add one more thing I've got a
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
scoot after this but I shall return in
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
the afternoon as Douglas MacArthur said
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
well he didn't say the afternoon but he
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
said he'd be back and I I will be back
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'd conclude my
 
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
testimony and happy to try to take any
 
00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.130 align:start position:0%
testimony and happy to try to take any
questions

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kaplan um
 
00:53:17.089 --> 00:53:17.099 align:start position:0%
question from representative notter
 
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
your testimony every term we have a
 
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
carbon bill and I I saved it I have a
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
file I just keep adding to it my
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
question for you is after
 
00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
all is implemented and taxed how much
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
does the carbon pricing actually lower
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
well I don't have an exact answer for
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
you for the exact precise number but
 
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
what I do know is that the the experts
 
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
what they say is that the carbon pricing
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
mechanism is the most effective way of
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
getting lowered carbon emissions because
 
00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
it actually leads people to make
 
00:53:56.809 --> 00:53:56.819 align:start position:0%
rational decisions in the marketplace
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
based on the true cost of the fuel
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
and so as opposed to like mandates
 
00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
coming from top down from the government
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
saying You must do this or you're going
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
to get in trouble or some kind of
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
subsidy some kind of carrot as they call
 
00:54:11.089 --> 00:54:11.099 align:start position:0%
it you know to try to entice you to do
 
00:54:14.089 --> 00:54:14.099 align:start position:0%
things there's nothing more effective
 
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
than actually having a market-based
 
00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:18.059 align:start position:0%
mechanism that will lead you to make
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
rational cost-based decisions
 
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.430 align:start position:0%
rational cost-based decisions
follow-up

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
follow-up well I have several sources
 
00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
that say that it it will be lowered by
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
.002 percent and I have to go put on my
 
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
other hat but I too shall return this
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you for your question
 
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.930 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you for your question
representative

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
okay see no further questions thank you
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
so much for your testimony and I will be
 
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
looking forward to seeing you coming
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
back this afternoon
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh I will call upon Mr Joe fantaine from
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
the Fontaine from the Department of
 
00:54:59.809 --> 00:54:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for the
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak again for the
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
record my name is Joe Fontaine I
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
represent uh Des
 
00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh Des has no position on the bill but I
 
00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
just wanted to provide some information
 
00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
that might be useful to the committee
 
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of uh reports out
 
00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:25.140 align:start position:0%
there on carbon pricing that may be of
 
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.150 align:start position:0%
there on carbon pricing that may be of
interest

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
one is by the carbon pricing leadership
 
00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:34.700 align:start position:0%
Coalition and that was issued in 2022
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
I have one copy of each report but I did
 
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
email links to the two reports to the
 
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
committee earlier this morning
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
the second report is the state and
 
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
trends of carbon pricing also issued in
 
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
2022 by the World Bank
 
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.410 align:start position:0%
2022 by the World Bank
um

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
so those provide background on carbon
 
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.309 align:start position:0%
so those provide background on carbon
pricing

00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
pricing
 
00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
of course at the at the regional level
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
we already have Reggie which is a form
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
of carbon pricing
 
00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:08.339 align:start position:0%
it's limited to the electricity sector
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
it's not economy wide
 
00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.890 align:start position:0%
it's not economy wide
um

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
that's briefly all I intended to um to
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
speak on today I just wanted to make the
 
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
committee aware of those two reports
 
00:56:23.089 --> 00:56:23.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
um just harkening back to representative
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
nodders question to the bill sponsor
 
00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
we've had Reggie which is as you said
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
carbon cap
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
ricing carbon emissions allowances for
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
over a decade and there's lots of
 
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
reports out
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
they're not about the effect of
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
Reggie in reducing the carbon intensity
 
00:56:57.599 --> 00:56:59.329 align:start position:0%
Reggie in reducing the carbon intensity
of

00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
generation electric generation in the
 
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
region yes any comment on that
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
well Des issues an annual report to to
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the annual report includes a graph
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
that shows the emission reductions that
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
have occurred since the beginning of
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
Reggie and they are significant over 50
 
00:57:22.849 --> 00:57:22.859 align:start position:0%
percent I believe
 
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
so over 50 percent it's way more than
 
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
point zero zero
 
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
zero two percent for example for New
 
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically uh Baseline
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
emissions which I think are uh 2005 if
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
memory serves
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
um or from the applicable Reggie sources
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
were eight
 
00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
a little over eight million and
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
um most recently they're a little under
 
00:57:56.569 --> 00:57:56.579 align:start position:0%
three million I believe so thank you
 
00:57:56.579 --> 00:57:57.770 align:start position:0%
three million I believe so thank you
I

00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
uh question representative Harrington
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
yeah just to follow up to this uh
 
00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
figures you put out is it correct to say
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
that the overwhelming majority of that
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
savings was a result of transferring
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
from generating electricity using oil
 
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
and coal to Natural Gas
 
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
I'll take Liberty of one last question
 
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
are you you did mention two reports are
 
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
there carbon carbon processing is Is Not
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
A New Concept are there other reports
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
out there or examples that the state can
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
glean from
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
this subject matter uh as opposed to
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
having another commission to study the
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
I think this has been mostly talked
 
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
about at the federal level and um as was
 
00:58:51.049 --> 00:58:51.059 align:start position:0%
mentioned by the bill sponsor
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh with the inflation reduction act that
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
was enacted
 
00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
um that's sort of an alternative to
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing so that's
 
00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:01.910 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing so that's
um

00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
you know funds grant money to fund
 
00:59:04.619 --> 00:59:06.549 align:start position:0%
you know funds grant money to fund
projects

00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:59:06.559 --> 00:59:08.150 align:start position:0%
projects
and

00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
um I think that both of the
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
organizations that I have uh
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
brought up today
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
previously in years past also issued
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
reports so they're they issue periodic
 
00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.450 align:start position:0%
reports so they're they issue periodic
reports

00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:24.530 align:start position:0%
reports
um

00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:27.289 --> 00:59:27.299 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head I'm not aware of
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
others but there probably are
 
00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:30.890 align:start position:0%
others but there probably are
um

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
that have information on carbon pricing
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much and thank you for
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you uh next I'll
 
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
take the liberty of calling on The
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
Honorable Marge shepardson who had been
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
a long-term member of the Science and
 
00:59:50.089 --> 00:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
Tech committee welcome back Marge it's
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
others have
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
given you statistics and and people
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
after me can give you more details I'd
 
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
like to just stick with the big picture
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
for what we're dealing with here we know
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
that climate change is happening
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
primarily through the use of burning
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels and when the tub is
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
overflowing I'm sure you've heard this
 
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
analogy the first thing you do is turn
 
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
off the tap well carbon fee and dividend
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
would help us turn off the tap of more
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions and then we could deal
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
with what's left behind and start
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
cleaning up the mess I think business as
 
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
usual is costing us a lot in terms of
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
health in terms of infrastructure
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
replacement after big storms etc etc and
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
business as usual is not really an
 
01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.089 align:start position:0%
business as usual is not really an
option

01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
carbon fee and dividend is a way as a
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
way to
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
give us some time so that we can as I
 
01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:06.059 align:start position:0%
said deal with the mess
 
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should be waiting for
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
one magic solution I know their ideas we
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
can blow Moon dust in the air and
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
reflect the sunlight all kinds of things
 
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
but we have a tool right here with
 
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
carbon fee and dividend that has been
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
proven to be effective it is not a big
 
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
government intervention it's a marketing
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
market-based intervention and it's um
 
01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
the money for it would come from
 
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
putting a price on pollution and causing
 
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh people who cause the problem to help
 
01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:37.789 align:start position:0%
uh people who cause the problem to help
us

01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
collect money so we can deal with it in
 
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
the past I know six years ago I heard
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
some of the same arguments and you're
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
probably tired of hearing the same
 
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
things every year but
 
01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:49.549 align:start position:0%
things every year but
um

01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
just saying that such a policy carbon
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
fee and dividend would harm low-income
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
people or that it would hurt the economy
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
or that it's going to grow government
 
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
these things can be said that doesn't
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
make them true I also remember hearing
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
big tobacco say smoking is not harmful
 
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
to your health well you can say it that
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it so let's rely instead on
 
01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
years and decades even of scientific
 
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
data of reports that tell us what is
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
really happening and give us realistic
 
01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
projections of the way we're going
 
01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
you're our leaders and I hope in this
 
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
case you will lead and allow us to study
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
the effects of carbon pricing on New
 
01:02:34.329 --> 01:02:34.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tourism businesses
 
01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
our economy our residents
 
01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
and uh I really hope you'll take this
 
01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:42.059 align:start position:0%
under consideration and vote yes thank
 
01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:44.690 align:start position:0%
under consideration and vote yes thank
you

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you of The Honorable
 
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
shiverson I'm sorry I almost called you
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative but it says as you were
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call okay just an
 
01:02:59.690 --> 01:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
announcement we have six more speakers
 
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
and we're already out of our a lot of
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
time so but they all I'm sure are going
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
to say the same thing so I'm going to
 
01:03:10.849 --> 01:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
invite Mr Joseph kowasnik up for his um
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Joe
 
01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:20.420 align:start position:0%
quasnick I'm representing myself
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
my background is is many years of
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
working for the National Grid as a vice
 
01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
president of environment and head of
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
climate change I've also served as a
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
director and chairman of the New
 
01:03:33.049 --> 01:03:33.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Co-op and have worked
 
01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
as a senior advisor energy advisor to a
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
series in Boston my testimony will be
 
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
very short one is I think this bill
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
focusing just on the bill itself tells
 
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
us that it will produce a commission
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
that will in in the reading of the bill
 
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
is will be bipartisan and I do believe
 
01:03:50.809 --> 01:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
that that bipartisan commission will be
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
able to come up with answers about what
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
the impacts of of carbon pricing will be
 
01:03:58.849 --> 01:03:58.859 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire in the future it's
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
important to to learn these things
 
01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.630 align:start position:0%
important to to learn these things
because

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
we will be sometime in the future will
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
be surrounded by a sea of states around
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
us and certainly and nationally that
 
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
will produce that will be requiring
 
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing on its own generators and
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
inventors of carbon within their states
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
and um you have to understand I think
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
you all you all do understand is that
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
much of our electricity because we are
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
tied into the regional grid much of our
 
01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:25.640 align:start position:0%
electricity comes from out of state
 
01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
typically Massachusetts New York Maine
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
and other states and those states are
 
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
already moving down the path of putting
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing in place and you you have
 
01:04:38.329 --> 01:04:38.339 align:start position:0%
to understand that the price per
 
01:04:40.849 --> 01:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour of electricity imported
 
01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
into our state from those States will
 
01:04:44.329 --> 01:04:44.339 align:start position:0%
have a carbon price built into that
 
01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour so we need uh to get back
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
to the bill we need to understand that
 
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
process we need to understand uh how
 
01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:54.299 align:start position:0%
these mechanisms will work
 
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
and um and and do that in such a fashion
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
that we could then craft our own
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
strategies within New Hampshire how to
 
01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
deal with that I'm not questioning or or
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
challenging uh climate change I think
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a reality but I'm thinking
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
more about the economic impacts of what
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
will happen to New Hampshire if we don't
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
begin to recognize what's happening with
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
outside of our state lines but also
 
01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
within our state lines and I have um
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
just a little perspective I was one on a
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholders group for the Reggie
 
01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:24.059 align:start position:0%
process back in the uh back when
 
01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
dinosaurs still roamed the Earth but um
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
we found that with Reggie if you did not
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
participate in the Reggie process all
 
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
the states that were crafting the Reggie
 
01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
policies and regulations if you weren't
 
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
at the table you were put in a distinct
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
disadvantage as a state for the same
 
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
reasons I just mentioned that
 
01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
electricity would be importing into New
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you would still have the
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
Reggie premiums built into that into
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
those those uh megawatt hour costs for
 
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:55.140 align:start position:0%
electricity and um and if you didn't
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
join Reggie you still paid those costs
 
01:05:59.210 --> 01:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
and then and could not benefit from the
 
01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
auction proceeds so it's a similar
 
01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:04.619 align:start position:0%
analogy and I think that unless we
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
understand those processes New Hampshire
 
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
will be put a great distinct uh
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
disadvantage both economically and also
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
from an environmental point of view
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate the time thank you very
 
01:06:17.089 --> 01:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
much and if there's any questions I'm
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
say no questions thank you so much for
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
your testimony appreciate it appreciate
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
it thank you we'll be hanging around
 
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
later or are you set to go what do you
 
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
mean by hanging
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
staying I will stay yes that's okay
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
okay I will call next on a
 
01:06:39.359 --> 01:06:41.329 align:start position:0%
okay I will call next on a
barbarous

01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:41.339 align:start position:0%
barbarous
 
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
South herd
 
01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.990 align:start position:0%
South herd
yes

01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
sorry and what was that pronunciation
 
01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.569 align:start position:0%
sorry and what was that pronunciation
again

01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
South hurt Southward thank you Southern
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to come today
 
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
and listen and
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm coming because I believe that
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing is absolutely positively
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
in our future whether we like it or not
 
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
and if we don't prepare for it we're
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
going to suffer the consequences
 
01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
Canada the UK and many other countries
 
01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
already have it and because they do
 
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
products with a high carbon content and
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's like iron steel cement fertilizer
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
aluminum and of course fossil fuels they
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
cost more in these countries
 
01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
and it makes them less competitive and
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
that means that the industries in those
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
countries consider relocating well
 
01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:56.339 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not what they want but
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
enter carbon border adjustment mechanism
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
are also called sebam
 
01:08:06.529 --> 01:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
with cbam countries that don't have a
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
hard carbon price they have to pay a fee
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
or sometimes called a levy if they want
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
to export products that have a high
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
carbon content across the border there
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
and uh you have a model of that on your
 
01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
sheet there and
 
01:08:25.739 --> 01:08:26.390 align:start position:0%
sheet there and
um

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
and if they do that
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
you know is the US going to want to
 
01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.689 align:start position:0%
you know is the US going to want to
follow

01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
suit I'm sure other countries will
 
01:08:38.530 --> 01:08:38.540 align:start position:0%
especially Canada the EU is already
 
01:08:41.809 --> 01:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
transitioning to this c-bam
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
um in October of this year
 
01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:45.769 align:start position:0%
um in October of this year
so

01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's coming
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
and the U.S is going to want to do it
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
too because Industries are going to be
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
pushing Congress to do it
 
01:08:54.359 --> 01:08:55.630 align:start position:0%
pushing Congress to do it
because

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's in their best interest they want to
 
01:08:59.950 --> 01:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
be competitive
 
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
the problem is is you can't establish a
 
01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:06.299 align:start position:0%
sea band without already having
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
a carbon price domestically
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
so that's why this is coming because
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
industry is going to push for it just
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
like they did the Kigali Amendment
 
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
so carbon fee and dividend as you've
 
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
heard before that's already been
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
proposed in Congress
 
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
and you've got a model of that too where
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to put a gradually
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
increasing price on carbon high carbon
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
content products at the source and all
 
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
of that Revenue goes back to the
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
citizens in equal portions
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
it is it popular well
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
um most people are just not familiar
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
with it they don't even know what you're
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
talking about but when they find out
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
they are supportive in fact in New
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here 38 towns have already
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
passed a resolution endorsing this
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
policy and more towns are scheduled to
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
vote on it this year
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
so um what would happen here in New
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we had carbon cash back or
 
01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.729 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we had carbon cash back or
cbam

01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
cbam
 
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
I think I think it's important to study
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
this what we want to put in more solar
 
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
and wind
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
would we want to build some charging
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
stations maybe as people move to EVs and
 
01:10:27.649 --> 01:10:27.659 align:start position:0%
that's good for tourism if they have a
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
place to charge isn't it
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
and would we see more Innovation and job
 
01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.729 align:start position:0%
and would we see more Innovation and job
creation

01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
creation
 
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
I believe carbon pricing and c-bam are
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
definitely in our future
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
but these policies do take time to enact
 
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
I think we need to use that time wisely
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
please vote to establish this Commission
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire needs to prepare for a
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
sustainable prosperous and healthy
 
01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.229 align:start position:0%
sustainable prosperous and healthy
future

01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.090 --> 01:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
thank you well done thank you
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
a question from representative Summers
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question I notice on the sheet
 
01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
here you have the the carbon fee and
 
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
dividend carbon cash back with a hundred
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
percent of the net revenue going back to
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
the rate payers
 
01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
we do that with Reggie right now as far
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
as goes back to ratepayers however right
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
now there's a bill that's actually we
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
just heard about yet last week that
 
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
takes that money away from the rate
 
01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
payers and puts it towards more uh
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
incentives for the uh for solar and wind
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
and such do you believe that the rate
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
payers would be in favor of this if they
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
knew they weren't going to get anything
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
back and it was going to Renewables
 
01:11:40.679 --> 01:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
back and it was going to Renewables
instead

01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
instead
 
01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:43.460 align:start position:0%
probably not
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
no I think it's important to give it
 
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:54.729 align:start position:0%
no I think it's important to give it
back

01:11:54.729 --> 01:11:54.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
Representatives do you have a question I
 
01:11:58.970 --> 01:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
do are we discussing this carbon uh
 
01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
pricing Bill are we discussing the uh
 
01:12:04.689 --> 01:12:04.699 align:start position:0%
other bills yes
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
100 carbon cut out of this bill right
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
that you did you get that cut out
 
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:16.330 align:start position:0%
that you did you get that cut out
yeah

01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:16.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
I think in this particular case the
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
question on does it work the same as was
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
was relevant and it wasn't carried any
 
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
further so I think it was
 
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.199 --> 01:12:41.689 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
um there's one particular aspect of this
 
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
bill that I have trouble getting a
 
01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
handle on and that is whether or not the
 
01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
state or the federal government would be
 
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
the best Avenue for enacting this type
 
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
of legislation I think a study report
 
01:12:59.330 --> 01:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
would probably answer that but I don't
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
know could you give me your thoughts on
 
01:13:00.719 --> 01:13:02.270 align:start position:0%
know could you give me your thoughts on
that

01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I understand the
 
01:13:06.169 --> 01:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
question but I think maybe it's about
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
whether carbon cashback would be state
 
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
or federal
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
should Outlaws it could be either but if
 
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
the federal government creates a carbon
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
cash back policy that would supersede
 
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
the state for sure
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
is it good uh in part but I'm also
 
01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
wondering where the most appropriate
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
place for this type of legislation is
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
whether it be more appropriate to deal
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
with carbon cash back on a state level
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
or a uniform Federal level and I really
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't know I must I'm looking for I mean
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
right now I understand there is federal
 
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
legislation going forward with carbon
 
01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
cash back well I think the most
 
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
appropriate level is federal myself but
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
you one way to prepare for the federal
 
01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
one is to go state
 
01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
I think it would be because what what
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
what the carbon cashback does is it just
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
changes the market forces altogether
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
and it drives Innovation job creation
 
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
and of course energy of efficiency
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
renewable energy you know all of those
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
things it drives that and what would
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
happen then is we'd be prepared for that
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
federal policy
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you so much for your
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
testimony well done
 
01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:33.179 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call next on a Joan Whitmer
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me a moment to
 
01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
provide some testimony in support of
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation my name is
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
Joan Whitmer and I'm a 43-year resident
 
01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
of the town of Amherst New Hampshire I'm
 
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
also a registered nurse who works for a
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
home health care agency and we routinely
 
01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
see patients in our service that suffer
 
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
from chronic respiratory diseases such
 
01:15:20.209 --> 01:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
as COPD congestive obstructive pulmonary
 
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
disease and congestive heart failure
 
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
these patients experience exacerbations
 
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
of their conditions when we have high
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
heat index days and as you know the
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
number of high heat index days is
 
01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:33.860 align:start position:0%
growing in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
and that this results in unplanned
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
unscheduled exact emergency department
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
visits which have of an increasing cost
 
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
in health care to the residents of this
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
state both through premiums such as
 
01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and through insurance premiums
 
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
that we as individuals pay when insured
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
individuals have higher utilization of
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
emergency departments it's a much higher
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
cost of care than say for instance Home
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
Health Care
 
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
in addition the prolonged pollen seasons
 
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
caused by climate change is resulting in
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
edmissions from people who suffer from
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
asthma and we all know that the tick
 
01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
season is now longer the ticks are
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
living in greater numbers over the
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
winter because it's not as cold and so
 
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
this is causing increases in tick-borne
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
diseases such as Lyme and now new
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
evidence is linking the um
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
air pollution associated with burning of
 
01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels with neurodegenerative
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
diseases such as Alzheimer's and
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
Parkinson's there's increasing evidence
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
supporting this link
 
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
so bottom line is we need to address
 
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
climate change and one way from
 
01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
everything that I've studied is through
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing with cash back dividends
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
for individuals so that the average
 
01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
consumer is not impacted by this but as
 
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
a whole we're factoring in the true cost
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
of burning fossil fuels into the cost of
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
the energy that we choose to consume it
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
as you've heard in prior testimony
 
01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
encourages individuals to provide
 
01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.130 align:start position:0%
encourages individuals to provide
additional

01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:09.050 align:start position:0%
additional
um

01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
steps to keep their houses more energy
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
efficient I myself recently installed a
 
01:17:17.689 --> 01:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
heat pump and am thrilled with the
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
significant reduction in my cost of
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
heating both through the complete
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
elamination of oil usage burning and a
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
reduction in my energy consumption so
 
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
those are examples New Hampshire needs
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
to prepare for carbon pricing and cash
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
back dividends by by studying the issue
 
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
as you've heard and I won't reiterate
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
too much that you know we need to be
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
prepared this is these are complex
 
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
policies I'm not only am I a nurse but I
 
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
have a master's in Business
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
Administration I worked 40 years in
 
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
corporate finance and accounting and
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
everyone knows that the better prepared
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
you are for significant change the
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
better off you'll be in accommodating
 
01:17:59.930 --> 01:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
those changes I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:02.689 align:start position:0%
those changes I'd be happy to answer any
questions

okay no questions thank you so much for
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
coming here

Joan I'm sorry
 
01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of names today I'm working my way
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
through here is as a substitute
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
I'm calling on Matt Stein next please I
 
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
think or Stern
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.450 --> 01:18:49.460 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Matt Stein I'm from Northampton
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh representing myself
 
01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.030 align:start position:0%
uh representing myself
um

01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
I think you've heard and you'll continue
 
01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
to hear that having a price on carbon
 
01:18:59.209 --> 01:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
that impacts every corner of New
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a matter of when not if I'm
 
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
the CEO of a venture-backed weather
 
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
analytics company called Salient
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
predictions every day I work closely
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
with Business Leaders of some of the
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
world's largest companies and the energy
 
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
Insurance manufacturing and agriculture
 
01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.970 align:start position:0%
Insurance manufacturing and agriculture
sectors

01:19:18.970 --> 01:19:18.980 align:start position:0%
sectors
 
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from personal
 
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
conversations with them that are also
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
corroborated by numerous surveys that
 
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
companies in the U.S overwhelmingly
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
support a price on carbon because it
 
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
drives Innovation which will transform
 
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
our economy and create new jobs
 
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
even carbon intensive businesses like
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
oil and gas are not only supportive but
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
are lobbying for a carbon price take
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
American petroleum Institute as an
 
01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.729 align:start position:0%
American petroleum Institute as an
example

01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
that said we need to understand the
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
impacts on New Hampshire's residents
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
businesses and municipalities most
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
studies demonstrate that the impacts on
 
01:19:57.770 --> 01:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing are overwhelmingly
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
positive for residents and businesses
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
but there may be a handful of
 
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
challenging situations
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
like serving certain carbon intensive
 
01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
small businesses that frankly may be
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
difficult to quickly green
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
um case in point my brother-in-law is a
 
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:17.219 align:start position:0%
third generation lobsterman what will
 
01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
that mean to his business we need to
 
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
identify those situations and come up
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
with potential solutions to limit any
 
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
adverse impacts to them
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
the good news is that there's a
 
01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of research and
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
modeling that has been done on carbon
 
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
pricing and this is not just academic
 
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
but lessons from Real World
 
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
implementations like are happening in
 
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:38.870 align:start position:0%
implementations like are happening in
Canada

01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
Canada
 
01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
we can learn from these and make sure
 
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
that our citizens are prepared
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
we do not want to be caught flat-footed
 
01:20:48.649 --> 01:20:48.659 align:start position:0%
when Federal carbon pricing legislation
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
discussions really take off so now is
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
the perfect time for New Hampshire to
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you a couple of interesting points
 
01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
here thank you for bringing those up
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions you're
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300 align:start position:0%

01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
it says here you have written testimony
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
um thank you chair and members of the
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
committee from for hearing me today my
 
01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
name is Matthew K Elaine I live in
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
Concord New Hampshire I have for the
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
last 30 years and I support this bill
 
01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
um as a relevant background I worked um
 
01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
within the division of Public Health
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
Services here for over 30 years both uh
 
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
and also in the in the private sector as
 
01:21:49.729 --> 01:21:49.739 align:start position:0%
a consultant
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
um primarily looking at Environmental
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
Health Data how do you bring together
 
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
what we see out there for environmental
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
exposures and the health outcomes for
 
01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years I specifically worked
 
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
under a CDC climate Grant looking at how
 
01:22:02.570 --> 01:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
do we research and understand this and
 
01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
then how do we build resilience so for
 
01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
this specific bill
 
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
um that I'm supporting the reasons are
 
01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
really that under the the first section
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
on findings it really talked about how
 
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
we needed to study carbon pricing right
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
we need to get out there and get in
 
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
front of it to understand it better and
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
get market-based um uh climate
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
protection and reducing of health and
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
economic impacts I believe we need this
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
to study commission to better assess how
 
01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
to keep New Hampshire and America
 
01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
competitive different changing
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
environmental and economic conditions
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
I believe in section two of them on this
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill they could be improved by adding
 
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
members that has a training experience
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
in public health impacts of
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
environmental exposures extreme weather
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
and climate change determining the
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
relationship between weather climate and
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
various Health outcomes is very
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
challenging and complex I've spent 10
 
01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
years and I'm just getting a sense for
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
some of the things you heard mentioned
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
here around Lyme disease respiratory
 
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
exposure saying to that sort and there's
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
good news right we've done very well as
 
01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
a nation improving our air quality and
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
water quality and people should know
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
about that there's a part in the bill
 
01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
that states in section 2 part 4B the
 
01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
commission still study the effects such
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
pricing would have on public health
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
including morbidity mortality effects on
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
reducing greenhouse gases and such if
 
01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
that remains an essential activity in
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
this commission then Public Health
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
expertise will be very beneficial so in
 
01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
conclusion I support the bill and I
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
support any efforts that we have to keep
 
01:23:31.370 --> 01:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in America more
 
01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
competitive and resilient to these
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
significant changes we have coming so
 
01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
that's it for my testimony thank you
 
01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions thank you for coming
 
01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
and testifying I appreciate it thank you

15 because I believe
 
01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
um I am the subject matter expert in
 
01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:22.940 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing of at the federal level
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
and uh around the world I'm John Gage
 
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
from Windham
 
01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
you will I appreciate if you could
 
01:24:31.729 --> 01:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
shorten it down quite a bit we are on a
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
time schedule here okay I understand
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I will certainly try and we
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
know you John so
 
01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
but I love talking carbon pricing and
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
this is a great opportunity thank you so
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
much for listening
 
01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:44.630 align:start position:0%
much for listening
um

01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
so I support HB 372
 
01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.790 align:start position:0%
so I support HB 372
um

01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
here's one way to look at it if we had
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
known 10 years ago
 
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
um the prices Energy prices gas and oil
 
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
prices were going to spike last year
 
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
if we knew for sure or had a very high
 
01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
likelihood of it happening 10 years ago
 
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
would we have done anything differently
 
01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:08.750 align:start position:0%
would we have done anything differently
yeah

01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
or would we have just
 
01:25:12.729 --> 01:25:12.739 align:start position:0%
let it happen
 
01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people hurting right
 
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
now from high electricity prices High
 
01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
heating oil prices
 
01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
they didn't think I better put
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
insulation in my house because energy is
 
01:25:29.570 --> 01:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
going to get really expensive they
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
didn't replace their their bulbs
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
probably with LEDs maybe they bought an
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
oil furnace
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
two years ago thinking that oil is a
 
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
good way to heat my house that's going
 
01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
to be another good way for 30 more years
 
01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
to be another good way for 30 more years
well

01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing is growing and spreading
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
around the world prices are going up 10
 
01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
years ago there were 23 countries
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
pricing carbon
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
countries and regions today there's 68
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
countries and regions pricing carbon
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's tripled in 10 years and the prices
 
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
are rising Reggie was brought up
 
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
Reggie's averaged about five dollars per
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
ton of CO2 Emissions on fossil fuels
 
01:26:13.129 --> 01:26:13.139 align:start position:0%
used to generate electricity
 
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
um which is about 20 of our greenhouse
 
01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
gas emissions
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
but representative Nutter asked does
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing work to reduce emissions
 
01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
and it's based on two things whether it
 
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
works or not what is the price
 
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
and how does the market believe that
 
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
that price is going to be stable or
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to it in the
 
01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:37.070 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to it in the
future

01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:38.450 align:start position:0%
future
so

01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
five dollars per ton of CO2 is not a
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
strong Market signal at all it's not
 
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
going to drive Innovation and Emissions
 
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
reductions what Reggie was doing for us
 
01:26:51.169 --> 01:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
was raising money that we could reinvest
 
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
in Energy Efficiency and help low-income
 
01:26:56.689 --> 01:26:56.699 align:start position:0%
households kind of prepare for the
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
transition transition it wasn't it
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
didn't drive down emissions 50 to New
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
but we do know what prices will do that
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
because this has been studied for
 
01:27:07.679 --> 01:27:08.689 align:start position:0%
because this has been studied for
decades

01:27:08.689 --> 01:27:08.699 align:start position:0%
decades
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
the high Commission on carbon pricing
 
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
part of the World Bank
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
um and associated with that report that
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
was mentioned
 
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
um the first report
 
01:27:24.010 --> 01:27:24.020 align:start position:0%
estimates we need a price of between 135
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
dollars per ton and thousands of dollars
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
per ton in 2030 in order to be on the
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
right emissions reductions path to
 
01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
achieve the 1.5 missions temperature
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
Target that's a global price we need to
 
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
be minimum 135 dollars per ton around
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
the world in 2030.
 
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
Canada is going to be there they're
 
01:27:51.169 --> 01:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
using carbon fee and dividends they're
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
at forty dollars now they're Rising
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
every year and they're going to be
 
01:27:58.850 --> 01:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
Canadian 170 U.S 135 dollars per ton in
 
01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:00.530 align:start position:0%
Canadian 170 U.S 135 dollars per ton in
2030.

01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
2030.
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
the EU price tripled in the last two
 
01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:03.890 align:start position:0%
the EU price tripled in the last two
years

01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
um they are now between 60 and 80 a ton
 
01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
they're using a cap in trade so the
 
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
price varies but they'll certainly be
 
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
around 135 dollars a ton in 2030 also
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
and as was mentioned they'll be using
 
01:28:17.689 --> 01:28:17.699 align:start position:0%
their c-bam
 
01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
to charge their carbon price on energy
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
intensive Goods that are imported into
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
that Marketplace
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
it's not just going to be the EU other
 
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
countries like Canada are watching this
 
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
closely and economists call what's going
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
to happen a carbon Club
 
01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
countries with similar prices will join
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
together and have no c-band between
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
those countries and trade
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
but other countries that don't have a
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
price on carbon will have to pay that
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
carbon price on Imports
 
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
the carbon Club is just going to keep
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
growing the e was starting at Canada the
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
UK and Japan are likely to join
 
01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.590 align:start position:0%
UK and Japan are likely to join
um

01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.209 --> 01:29:02.219 align:start position:0%
of all the developed countries in the
 
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
world only two of them don't price
 
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
carbon right now
 
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:05.990 align:start position:0%
carbon right now
um

01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
Australia did price it
 
01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:10.139 align:start position:0%
now they're not pricing it but they'll
 
01:29:12.410 --> 01:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
likely price it again it's one of the
 
01:29:14.330 --> 01:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
problems is how do you keep the carbon
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
price there and permanent and durable
 
01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
and that's where the cash back comes in
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
so Reggie spends most of the money or
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
returns most of the money it depends on
 
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
what's going on and it's got a low
 
01:29:29.689 --> 01:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
carbon price it's around 13 per ton
 
01:29:31.129 --> 01:29:31.139 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:29:31.139 --> 01:29:32.510 align:start position:0%
right now
um

01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
but a regional carbon price or a
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
straight carbon price doesn't have the
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
benefit of being able to use c-bam
 
01:29:41.810 --> 01:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
so you can only go to a certain level
 
01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
before you start to worry about pushing
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
your businesses to free polluting States
 
01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:48.900 align:start position:0%
or regions
 
01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:49.669 align:start position:0%
or regions
um

01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:49.679 --> 01:29:50.810 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's a good way to send a heads up to
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
your state or your region
 
01:29:57.239 --> 01:29:57.890 align:start position:0%
your state or your region
um

01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
that carbon pricing is coming from above
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
at the federal level at the federal
 
01:30:06.169 --> 01:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
level we can put a steadily Rising high
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
price on carbon The Economist statement
 
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
that I passed out describes what's going
 
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:12.729 align:start position:0%
that I passed out describes what's going
on

01:30:12.729 --> 01:30:12.739 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
as a market failure it was described as
 
01:30:19.729 --> 01:30:19.739 align:start position:0%
when the costs of pollution are not
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
included into the price of goods
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
then it can producers and consumers are
 
01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
not completely informed by price and so
 
01:30:31.209 --> 01:30:31.219 align:start position:0%
they don't make efficient decisions
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the case of pollution a third party
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
is being harmed and that harm is not
 
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
being accounted for in the market that's
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
why economists want to put a price where
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
the pollution enters the economy so that
 
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
The Guiding hand of the market the price
 
01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:50.219 align:start position:0%
signal of the pollution is seen by
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
investors and producers and consumers
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's simply the most cost effective way
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
to reduce pollution comprehensively
 
01:30:58.970 --> 01:30:58.980 align:start position:0%

01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
policies at the federal level
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
why am I at the state level
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
I have Insight that I'm hoping
 
01:31:28.729 --> 01:31:28.739 align:start position:0%
our state will use
 
01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of anticipating a
 
01:31:34.810 --> 01:31:34.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
can you sum up please yeah sure
 
01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
so car there's Global carbon pricing
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
Trends it's spreading prices are rising
 
01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
there's National carbon pricing Trends
 
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
the federal bill was introduced with
 
01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bicameral support three
 
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
sessions ago it had several co-sponsors
 
01:31:56.689 --> 01:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
the next time it was introduced it was
 
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
bipartisan the house it got up to about
 
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
75 co-sponsors last session it got up to
 
01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
96 co-sponsors
 
01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:04.610 align:start position:0%
96 co-sponsors
um

01:32:04.610 --> 01:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:07.729 --> 01:32:07.739 align:start position:0%
it is a carbon fee and dividend bill so
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
why should our state study what the
 
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
impact of this would be on New Hampshire
 
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
well the longer we take to start placing
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
carbon at the federal level the steeper
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to rise that price
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
to meet to join that carbon club with
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
all of our trading partners
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
um we should do it as soon as possible
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
so that we can do what Canada is doing
 
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
and increase it a little bit each year
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
if we wait till 2030 and we have to put
 
01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
135 dollars per ton price that's a
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
dollar 35 and a gallon of gasoline 10
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt hour in fossil fuel
 
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
electricity we don't want to do that
 
01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
um is that your closing statement
 
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
so let me answer a couple questions
 
01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
uh one was fine
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
um representative Nader said .002
 
01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
percent she I think she's trying to
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
quote the amount of emissions that New
 
01:32:59.090 --> 01:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire contributes as far as the
 
01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:00.530 align:start position:0%
Hampshire contributes as far as the
country

01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
um she's got her decimal point wrong
 
01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:03.780 align:start position:0%
when you say percent you move the
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
decimal point over New Hampshire is two
 
01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
is 0.2 percent of U.S emissions
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
um we're about half per capita what the
 
01:33:16.370 --> 01:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
rest of the country is what does that
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
mean with a federal carbon fee and
 
01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:18.770 align:start position:0%
mean with a federal carbon fee and
dividend

01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
dividend
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
we get more money back more money that's
 
01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
being collected from other states
 
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
um the average household will be ahead
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
by a thousand dollars in year 10 with
 
01:33:33.169 --> 01:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
the the dividend that's after paying all
 
01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
of the higher prices
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
um do we need a commission that was your
 
01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
third request so could you could you end
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
um proxy carbon pricing is being used by
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
hundreds of businesses and cities around
 
01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
the country already
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
they're not pricing carbon they're
 
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
they're building a carbon price into
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
their books so that they make
 
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
forward-looking decisions so that when
 
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
the federal government does price carbon
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
they will not have made bad decisions in
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
the meantime do I buy an oil furnace or
 
01:34:14.209 --> 01:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
a heat pump well if you know that the
 
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
carbon price is going to be 135 dollars
 
01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:20.540 align:start position:0%
in 2030 and double that in 2040
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
and so on you will favor the heat pump
 
01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
even though it's a little more expensive
 
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
it's going to save you a lot of money
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
over time and that's what we can do for
 
01:34:32.689 --> 01:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
the state I don't like wasting money I
 
01:34:34.729 --> 01:34:34.739 align:start position:0%
don't want our state to waste money we
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
need to do a bipartisan look at the
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing picture
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that we'll decide it is
 
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
inevitable and take steps make a plan
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
and figure out how we can take save
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
money and use this insight to our
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
advantage there's lots of opportunities
 
01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
that we can that we can do also thank
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
I have one question uh representative
 
01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:06.830 align:start position:0%
I have one question uh representative
partial

01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and uh thank you for
 
01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
do I understand correctly maybe I have
 
01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
the wrong take on this but do I
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
understand correctly that if we enact
 
01:35:19.129 --> 01:35:19.139 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing will we be returning
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
money to Consumers if we do not intact
 
01:35:25.129 --> 01:35:25.139 align:start position:0%
enact it we'll be setting it off sure in
 
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
the form of tariffs is that basically
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
how it's what we're talking about here
 
01:35:28.679 --> 01:35:30.110 align:start position:0%
how it's what we're talking about here
yeah

01:35:30.110 --> 01:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
um you know the money is going to go to
 
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
other countries if we're not pricing it
 
01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:37.970 align:start position:0%
other countries if we're not pricing it
here

01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
um at some point it's just going to be
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
crazy for us to be paying all of our
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
trading partners
 
01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
a carbon price so that we can allow
 
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
carbon pollution to be free in our own
 
01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:49.430 align:start position:0%
carbon pollution to be free in our own
economy

01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
um we can get that money to households
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
by pricing carbon we make our businesses
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
more competitive in the global
 
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
Marketplace we have a carbon Advantage
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
right now the EU
 
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
cbam is going to be good for the United
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
States for the first couple years the
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
China has to pay three times as much of
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
a carbon fee and India will be paying
 
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
four times as much of a carbon fee in
 
01:36:13.129 --> 01:36:13.139 align:start position:0%
the beginning but China has a carbon
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
price they will be decarbonizing and if
 
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
we don't decarbonize we have a
 
01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
competitive Advantage right now so if we
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
put a price on carbon at the federal
 
01:36:25.129 --> 01:36:25.139 align:start position:0%
level we'll keep that Advantage which
 
01:36:26.689 --> 01:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
will pay off the rest of the century
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you yeah
 
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
seeing the other questions thank you
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony Mr Gage and
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
seeing no other pink slips or speakers
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.149 --> 01:36:43.159 align:start position:0%
I'm closing the public hearing on
 
01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
372 and I'm asking representative
 
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
project to report the blue sheet results
 
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
and the online uh thank you chair on the
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
previous bill
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 558
 
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet was none in favor one
 
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
opposed online it was 45 in favor
 
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
one opposed one neutral
 
01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 372 the blue sheep was
 
01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:20.060 align:start position:0%
nine in favor none opposed online was
 
01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
171 in favor none opposed non-neutral
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:33.169 --> 01:37:33.179 align:start position:0%
okay moving right along uh we are I will
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
now open
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing on
 
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
House Bill 509 and I believe represent
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
Harrington will be introducing the bill
 
01:38:12.010 --> 01:38:12.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
graphic Jam here
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
all right thank you chairman uh I will
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
make this uh rather brief concealing
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
that we are in uh behind on schedule
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
here there's a series of these bills
 
01:38:26.930 --> 01:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
that would affect the renewable
 
01:38:30.169 --> 01:38:30.179 align:start position:0%
portfolios here uh um standard and what
 
01:38:32.450 --> 01:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask is that we retain the
 
01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
bills so that they can be merged into a
 
01:38:38.689 --> 01:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
single Bill uh I simply didn't have the
 
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
time to do this when I was trying to
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
sign off lsrs so I apologize for that so
 
01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get into a debate with
 
01:38:46.970 --> 01:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
anybody on this I'm just saying that my
 
01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
position is I would like to see the bill
 
01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
and there'll be a couple of others
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
retained so that we can work up a
 
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
singular Bill and not waste everybody's
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
time on multiple bills that basically
 
01:38:59.450 --> 01:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
address the same issue and I will not
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
take questions because there isn't any
 
01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:03.709 align:start position:0%
take questions because there isn't any
questions

01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your short
 
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.590 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your short
testimony

01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
I like it
 
01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh okay well I will call on a uh let's
 
01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
see do I have
 
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
a particular
 
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
cards here
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.129 --> 01:39:31.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
good morning uh for the record my name
 
01:39:35.209 --> 01:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
is Jason stock I'm the executive
 
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Timberland
 
01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
Owners Association and I will be very
 
01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:39.350 align:start position:0%
Owners Association and I will be very
brief

01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
brief
 
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.010 align:start position:0%
brief
um

01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
giving the given the word that we just
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
heard that the bill will be sought to
 
01:39:47.090 --> 01:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
retain we would support that motion we
 
01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
don't support this bill and for all the
 
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
reasons that I had expressed to my
 
01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony on house bills 160
 
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
165 166 that you heard earlier about
 
01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
about the RPS and its impacts on biomass
 
01:40:05.149 --> 01:40:05.159 align:start position:0%
markets and the forest products industry
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
and folks growing Timberland and trying
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
to manage Timberland so I will happy to
 
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but for the sake of
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
brevity I will leave it at that and uh
 
01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.530 --> 01:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
question from Mr uh Mr from a
 
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so I mean this
 
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
bill actually would phase out the RPS
 
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
within four years
 
01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:35.810 align:start position:0%
within four years
um

01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:38.090 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
given given your position with the
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
Timberland owners what would you like to
 
01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
see in terms of the RPS
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
we like the program we like the current
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
program we do not want to see it phased
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
out we we like the class structure we
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
like and we like the way it it currently
 
01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:59.270 align:start position:0%
like and we like the way it it currently
operates

01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:00.770 --> 01:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and thank you for
 
01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
Testimony uh calling next on Mr Griffin
 
01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:06.229 align:start position:0%
Testimony uh calling next on Mr Griffin
Roberts

01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
Roberts
 
01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
welcome to this committee
 
01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you members of the committee I
 
01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh Griffin Roberts State energy program
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
manager at the department of energy
 
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
um I was just out in the hallway and
 
01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
found out that uh the prime sponsor
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
indicated that he'd like to retain the
 
01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:27.290 align:start position:0%
indicated that he'd like to retain the
bill

01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
um the department is neutral on the bill
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
as introduced but we did have some
 
01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
observations I could go into that but if
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
the committee would like to move on I
 
01:41:37.729 --> 01:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
will just take my seat in the back
 
01:41:40.729 --> 01:41:40.739 align:start position:0%
anybody have any objection to Mr robors
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
good morning uh thank you
 
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak on
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
behalf of standard power this morning
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
and as a resident of New Hampshire
 
01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
I am opposing this bill as I fear it
 
01:42:15.169 --> 01:42:15.179 align:start position:0%
will overall be holding New Hampshire
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
back in the energy sector the renewable
 
01:42:20.689 --> 01:42:20.699 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard has allowed for
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%
different types of energy to become
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
competitive with carbon Reliant energy
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
sources such as colon natural gas and
 
01:42:30.050 --> 01:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard and
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund have helped pave
 
01:42:34.129 --> 01:42:34.139 align:start position:0%
the way for this positive change in our
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
Energy Mix
 
01:42:38.209 --> 01:42:38.219 align:start position:0%
um I feel as though we would be putting
 
01:42:40.490 --> 01:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
ourselves behind other states by not
 
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
embracing a cleaner energy future here
 
01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.179 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and as a long time
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
citizen I want to see our state push the
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
envelope on new and cleaner Energy
 
01:42:52.669 --> 01:42:52.679 align:start position:0%
Technologies and continue to annually
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
increase the renewable portfolio
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
standard which is why I oppose this bill
 
01:43:01.370 --> 01:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll accept any questions
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
well spoken
 
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
um you said long time resident how long
 
01:43:08.689 --> 01:43:08.699 align:start position:0%
have you been 21 21 years born in Mass
 
01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
raised in New Hampshire
 
01:43:12.169 --> 01:43:12.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for being one of the Smart
 
01:43:12.179 --> 01:43:16.910 align:start position:0%
thank you for being one of the Smart
Ones

01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.729 --> 01:43:19.739 align:start position:0%
any questions from anyone
 
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
no well thank you for coming appreciate
 
01:43:27.290 --> 01:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
okay next I'm going to call on a uh
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you good morning and thank
 
01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:42.659 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to speak
 
01:43:45.169 --> 01:43:45.179 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of standard power and as a
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
young person concerned about the energy
 
01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
future of New Hampshire
 
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm opposing this bill because the
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard and the
 
01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund are valuable
 
01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for diversifying the state's
 
01:43:58.609 --> 01:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
energy portfolio and ensuring a
 
01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
resilient future for the grid
 
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
providing funding for renewable energy
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
development in New Hampshire allows for
 
01:44:06.649 --> 01:44:06.659 align:start position:0%
another stream of domestic energy at
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
times when the supply chain for fossil
 
01:44:11.209 --> 01:44:11.219 align:start position:0%
fuels is compromised and helps us
 
01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
prepare for a more energy dependent
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
future in line with such Trends as
 
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
vehicle electrification by investing in
 
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
the expansion of Renewables now we won't
 
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
have to play catch-up later on and we
 
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
can be sure of a reliable power supply
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
um if anything we should increase the
 
01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
RPS level to help build out a
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
distributed generation in New Hampshire
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
to keep up with electrification so thank
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:45.050 --> 01:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
so you know questions thank you so much
 
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
I have the last speaker is Mr Nick
 
01:44:47.940 --> 01:45:06.530 align:start position:0%
I have the last speaker is Mr Nick
Krakoff

01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
hey good morning my name is Nick
 
01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
craigoff I'm with the conservation law
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
Foundation here in Concord I've also
 
01:45:14.209 --> 01:45:14.219 align:start position:0%
submitted a written testimony as well as
 
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
a recent study by renew Northeast which
 
01:45:18.169 --> 01:45:18.179 align:start position:0%
I encourage you to look at that is being
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
handed around right now the RPS benefits
 
01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's economy provides public
 
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
health and environmental benefits and
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
helps reduce energy rates by
 
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
diversifying New Hampshire's energy
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
generation I want to talk mainly about
 
01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
the diversity benefits the energy
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
diversity benefits and how eliminating
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
the RPS would be a major step backwards
 
01:45:43.609 --> 01:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
you know right in the RPS itself RSA 362
 
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
F1 it talks about how one of the
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
purposes of the RPS is to provide energy
 
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
diversity benefits which can which has
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
the potential to lower and stabilize
 
01:45:55.609 --> 01:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
Future Energy costs by reducing exposure
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
to volatile fuel prices
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what the RPS does the
 
01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
higher electric rates that New Hampshire
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
is currently experiencing that's largely
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
the result of New Hampshire's over
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
dependence on natural gas for power
 
01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
generation and for heating natural gas
 
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
prices are very volatile in contrast the
 
01:46:16.250 --> 01:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
price of renewable energy is much more
 
01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:17.750 align:start position:0%
price of renewable energy is much more
stable

01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
stable
 
01:46:20.090 --> 01:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
um and you know now it can cost even
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
less than than fossil fuel energy
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
sources so included in my in my
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
testimony attached there is a study from
 
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
a new Northeast and I would draw your
 
01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
attention to um
 
01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
Pages or slides 8 through 10 and 12
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
through 13 there
 
01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:38.030 align:start position:0%
through 13 there
um

01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
you know basically what those slides
 
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
show in that attached study is that
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
increased Renewables
 
01:46:46.729 --> 01:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
um like offshore wind or even onshore
 
01:46:50.209 --> 01:46:50.219 align:start position:0%
wind they provide a useful hedge against
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
volatile fuel fuel prices so when those
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
um you know what energy prices Spike
 
01:46:56.689 --> 01:46:56.699 align:start position:0%
over the winter like where we've seen
 
01:46:58.850 --> 01:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
this winter you know by having that
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
stable cost for for wind or offshore
 
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
wind that can really provide a hedge
 
01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
against those volatile fuel prices
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
um you know also provides system
 
01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
reliability benefits and then it also
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
has a price suppressing effect so you
 
01:47:17.050 --> 01:47:17.060 align:start position:0%
know this is real evidence that
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
increased Renewables provide provide
 
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
benefits for for ratepayers and and um
 
01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:23.219 align:start position:0%
you know New Hampshire's families and
 
01:47:25.490 --> 01:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
businesses and can you know it's not a
 
01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
cost on on people it's not going to
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
increase costs
 
01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:30.649 align:start position:0%
increase costs
um

01:47:30.649 --> 01:47:30.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
Yeah so basically by eliminating the RPS
 
01:47:37.129 --> 01:47:37.139 align:start position:0%
as this bill would do it would um make
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents even more
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
exposed to those volatile fuel prices
 
01:47:42.530 --> 01:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
um and then finally you know as we're
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
aware the Renewables benefit the
 
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
environment and Public Health in New
 
01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:46.609 align:start position:0%
environment and Public Health in New
Hampshire

01:47:46.609 --> 01:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
so you know and some there's there's
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
numerous benefits from from Renewables
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
eliminating the RPS will be a big step
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
backwards and um yeah I urge you to itl
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
this bill I don't think retaining it is
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
is a useful Endeavor
 
01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and thank you and happy to answer any
 
01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:06.350 align:start position:0%
um and thank you and happy to answer any
questions

01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and I'll
 
01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
call on representative Corman
 
01:48:13.609 --> 01:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr Krakow
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
um regarding wind uh you say that the
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
prices are stable but I mean wind varies
 
01:48:24.649 --> 01:48:24.659 align:start position:0%
in its intensity and also I just saw an
 
01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
article in Bloomberg about actual wind
 
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
Mills um offshore blowing over so I mean
 
01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
can we really say that that wind prices
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
are going to be stable well you know
 
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
unlike natural gas prices where you know
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's a market it's a commodity
 
01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
you know the the price of that commodity
 
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
is based on whatever the market is doing
 
01:48:48.169 --> 01:48:48.179 align:start position:0%
you know wind is an interminable
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
resource there's there's no you know
 
01:48:52.129 --> 01:48:52.139 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no cost for them for
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
the marginal production of each extra
 
01:48:56.689 --> 01:48:56.699 align:start position:0%
unit of wind you know it in some
 
01:48:58.490 --> 01:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
instances the marginal cost can be let
 
01:49:00.169 --> 01:49:00.179 align:start position:0%
can be less than zero because you're not
 
01:49:01.850 --> 01:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's no market price
 
01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
for for wind
 
01:49:07.129 --> 01:49:07.139 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm unaware of the
 
01:49:09.649 --> 01:49:09.659 align:start position:0%
when turbines blowing over um you know
 
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of wind production in
 
01:49:13.729 --> 01:49:13.739 align:start position:0%
the North Sea
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
um you know and that's been very very
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
successful for
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
the United Kingdom and Denmark and
 
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
Norway and those countries diversifying
 
01:49:25.570 --> 01:49:25.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds
 
01:49:30.050 --> 01:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr Krakow for being here
 
01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:32.629 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr Krakow for being here
again

01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
um I want to bring everyone's attention
 
01:49:38.209 --> 01:49:38.219 align:start position:0%
to the to page 11 of of the handout that
 
01:49:41.290 --> 01:49:41.300 align:start position:0%
you distributed and ask you to
 
01:49:43.609 --> 01:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit more on what's
 
01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
going on there this is
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
um the large state right next to us
 
01:49:48.179 --> 01:49:49.189 align:start position:0%
um the large state right next to us
Maine

01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
01:49:52.570 --> 01:49:52.580 align:start position:0%
uh puc
 
01:49:55.129 --> 01:49:55.139 align:start position:0%
showing that they're already going out
 
01:49:57.890 --> 01:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
for long-term contracts
 
01:50:00.290 --> 01:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
for Renewal power can you just comment
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
sure I mean so but basically you know
 
01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
this kind of shows the net benefits of
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
having power purchase agreements for
 
01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
Renewables that this is for onshore wind
 
01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
because there's no offshore wind in New
 
01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
England yet but basically you know this
 
01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
has tried to calculate all those
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
benefits you know mainly the
 
01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
um the ratepayer benefits the cost
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
suppressing benefits from having those
 
01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
additional resources on the grid and you
 
01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
know there's been pretty significant
 
01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
benefits to repairs already having those
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
extra resources on the grid from
 
01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
existing onshore you know land-based
 
01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
wind farms up in the northern part of
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
Maine correct yes
 
01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:39.010 align:start position:0%
Maine correct yes
thanks

01:50:39.010 --> 01:50:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
any other questions thank you so much
 
01:50:43.490 --> 01:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
for your testimony seeing your other
 
01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
speaker cards here
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close testimony on 509 and
 
01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:56.450 --> 01:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
01:51:00.350 --> 01:51:00.360 align:start position:0%

with that said I'm going to
 
01:51:17.209 --> 01:51:17.219 align:start position:0%
open up
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
our final bill for this morning which is
 
01:51:24.530 --> 01:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
HB 523 and call upon the sponsor
 
01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative partial

01:52:11.689 --> 01:52:11.699 align:start position:0%
um the bill is about increasing our
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
definitely very limited from one to five
 
01:52:18.649 --> 01:52:18.659 align:start position:0%
megawatts it wishes to make oh thank you
 
01:52:21.590 --> 01:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
one Mega limit is an arbitrary barrier
 
01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
so it's a five megawatt limit though for
 
01:52:25.609 --> 01:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
the installer of a nameplate system that
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
does not exceed 4.99 name platin term
 
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
there are economics a scale that benefit
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
not only the generator but the entire
 
01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:34.070 align:start position:0%
not only the generator but the entire
grid

01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
grid
 
01:52:36.290 --> 01:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
grid decentralization allows load
 
01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:38.330 align:start position:0%
grid decentralization allows load
reduction

01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:52:40.609 --> 01:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
the less Reliant we are on fossil fuel
 
01:52:42.290 --> 01:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
and this is the surest way to break the
 
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
Monopoly of fossil fuel allowing Market
 
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.100 align:start position:0%

01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:49.310 align:start position:0%

01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
payers
 
01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh the more we can flatten our Peak
 
01:52:53.689 --> 01:52:53.699 align:start position:0%
capacity demand the more we can lower
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
energy costs that's that's one of our
 
01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
major drivers and these alternate
 
01:53:00.169 --> 01:53:00.179 align:start position:0%
sources while they do not work at night
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
as somebody May point out they work
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
during the day and they do work as load
 
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:06.350 align:start position:0%
during the day and they do work as load
reductions

01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
um last year the long-awaited value of
 
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resource report the
 
01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
VGA report
 
01:53:13.970 --> 01:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
I concluded there's virtually no
 
01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
significant cost shifting and not
 
01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
metering in fact by reducing Peak demand
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
through the dispute energy we not only
 
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
lower transmission costs but also reduce
 
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
the peak demand and again resulting in
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
lower energy costs
 
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
a little bit of history in 2019 house
 
01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
Bell 365 passed the house with what
 
01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
should have been
 
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
a veto proof margin
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
after suno's veto with a bill in the
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
house failed to override The veto by 14
 
01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.350 align:start position:0%
house failed to override The veto by 14
votes

01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
votes
 
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
we know and voters know that
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
diversification is the key to driving
 
01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
our electric prices down
 
01:53:50.090 --> 01:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
raising the net metering limit should
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
have been done years ago
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I deserve that our failure to
 
01:53:55.010 --> 01:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
stimulate a diversified grid has
 
01:53:56.570 --> 01:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
contributed to the higher fuel our
 
01:53:58.370 --> 01:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
higher fuel costs
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
five megawatt system is not only more
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
cost efficient than a one megawatt
 
01:54:05.570 --> 01:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
system but also a system that that size
 
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
is capable of powering something the
 
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
effect of 1 350 homes
 
01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
in summary
 
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
the benefits of distributed energy
 
01:54:14.209 --> 01:54:14.219 align:start position:0%
resource include lower cost Energy
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
System level capacity operating reserves
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
distribution distribution level capacity
 
01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
and nut value to Dr grid like avoiding
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Investments improving
 
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
resilience and increasing integration of
 
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
clean energy
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:36.290 --> 01:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I just said Thank you Mr chairman
 
01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be taking my question
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
clarification you mentioned the report
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
that said there was no significant cost
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
shifting uh from net metering I believe
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
that was based on net metering one
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
megawatt and lower in fact they didn't
 
01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
look it above one megawatt as your bill
 
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
proposes because there is none of that
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
allowed right now so would it be correct
 
01:54:58.729 --> 01:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
to say that's only for below one
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
megawatt there was no significant cost
 
01:55:03.169 --> 01:55:03.179 align:start position:0%
shifting I believe that would be oh
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I believe
 
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
that would be correct but I also think
 
01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
that we could extrapolate from that
 
01:55:10.129 --> 01:55:10.139 align:start position:0%
report and also one other thing that
 
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
report did not take into consideration
 
01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
was the current
 
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
we haven't cost of our energy
 
01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:23.629 --> 01:55:23.639 align:start position:0%
seeing your questions thank you so much
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
well next I'm going to call on our
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
illustrious orator and flamboyant
 
01:55:42.649 --> 01:55:42.659 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate Mr Donald crease
 
01:55:42.659 --> 01:55:45.709 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate Mr Donald crease
flamboyant

01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:48.169 --> 01:55:48.179 align:start position:0%
foreign I think I should probably stand
 
01:55:52.129 --> 01:55:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.530 --> 01:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh good morning honorable members of the
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
committee Mr Vice chair I'm Donald
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
crease the consumer advocate here to
 
01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of House Bill 5 23 is
 
01:56:05.870 --> 01:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
represented as introduced by
 
01:56:09.470 --> 01:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative partial uh as he
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
indicated in his testimony the question
 
01:56:14.330 --> 01:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
of raising the limit on net metering
 
01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
from its current one megawatt up to
 
01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
4.999 megawatts is a familiar subject
 
01:56:22.189 --> 01:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
here at the legislative office building
 
01:56:24.370 --> 01:56:24.380 align:start position:0%
and across the street at the state house
 
01:56:28.729 --> 01:56:28.739 align:start position:0%
uh I I would like to draw your attention
 
01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
to certain provisions of this bill that
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
the sponsor didn't mention which has to
 
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
do with the language on page two of the
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
bill beginning on line 23 and what that
 
01:56:43.070 --> 01:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
language does is mandate that net
 
01:56:46.370 --> 01:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
metering be treated as a load reducer
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
for purposes of how it is accounted for
 
01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
on the elect on the electric grid and I
 
01:56:57.010 --> 01:56:57.020 align:start position:0%
think that is a valuable bit of
 
01:57:00.250 --> 01:57:00.260 align:start position:0%
legal clarification
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
that will benefit the state regardless
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
of what the net metering limit is
 
01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
because when we treat
 
01:57:10.850 --> 01:57:10.860 align:start position:0%
um net metering as a load reducer it
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
basically makes net metering invisible
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
at the bulk power level and saves a lot
 
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
of money on transmission
 
01:57:22.209 --> 01:57:22.219 align:start position:0%
costs as a result and that is
 
01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
likely to make net metering a much more
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
economical proposition from any
 
01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
standpoint and therefore from the
 
01:57:31.790 --> 01:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
perspective of the residential rate
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
mirror class that I represent a a very
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
good idea I I've never really talked
 
01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:41.820 align:start position:0%
very much about the possibility of
 
01:57:43.970 --> 01:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
increasing the net metering limit Beyond
 
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
one megawatt for the simple reason that
 
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
as far as I know there aren't any
 
01:57:50.450 --> 01:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
residential customers in New Hampshire
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
who are likely to put three four or five
 
01:57:56.330 --> 01:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
or four point nine nine nine megawatts
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
of net metering in their backyards that
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
that really is an industrial scale net
 
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
metering array and you would have to
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
have a very large backyard in order to
 
01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
go beyond you'd have to have a large
 
01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
backyard even to get to one megawatt as
 
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
a residential customer so in that sense
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's never really been my issue I will
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
say that the law consigns to the Public
 
01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission the responsibility
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
for determining what the just and
 
01:58:29.689 --> 01:58:29.699 align:start position:0%
reasonable rate formula is for net
 
01:58:33.890 --> 01:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
metering and I think because the vder
 
01:58:36.410 --> 01:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
study has recently been completed and
 
01:58:39.169 --> 01:58:39.179 align:start position:0%
because the consulting firm uh dunski
 
01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
that did that study is about to update
 
01:58:43.490 --> 01:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
it to account for the recent uptake in
 
01:58:46.189 --> 01:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
Energy prices I I think that we can
 
01:58:48.290 --> 01:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
reasonably depend on the Public
 
01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to do a good job of
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
determining what the right way is to
 
01:58:56.689 --> 01:58:56.699 align:start position:0%
compensate customers who choose to net
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
meter and so I think that's compatible
 
01:59:03.169 --> 01:59:03.179 align:start position:0%
with the idea idea of increasing the
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
the limit up to 4.99 there is a little
 
01:59:09.649 --> 01:59:09.659 align:start position:0%
bit of confusion that I'm having and it
 
01:59:13.370 --> 01:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
might be because uh I'm just in in a
 
01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
characteristic fog but at the very end
 
01:59:17.890 --> 01:59:17.900 align:start position:0%
of the bill there's language about
 
01:59:20.689 --> 01:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
grandfathering and
 
01:59:23.209 --> 01:59:23.219 align:start position:0%
unless I'm mistaken the language is
 
01:59:28.129 --> 01:59:28.139 align:start position:0%
backwards because it says that net
 
01:59:31.370 --> 01:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
metering arrays that first become
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
operational on or after July first
 
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
became operational on or after July 1st
 
01:59:38.109 --> 01:59:38.119 align:start position:0%
of 2019
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh our grandfathered whereas net
 
01:59:43.490 --> 01:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
metering installations that became
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
operational before July 1 of 2019 are
 
01:59:48.589 --> 01:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
not grandfathered and I think that might
 
01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
be backwards unless I'm missing
 
01:59:52.250 --> 01:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
something so that's something for you
 
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
all to consider depending on how you uh
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
treat the bill but I think it is worthy
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
of your favorable consideration uh and I
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
think that's about all I have to say
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
about it I would of course be happy to
 
02:00:05.930 --> 02:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that the chair
 
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
would be willing to entertain
 
02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Corman
 
02:00:14.450 --> 02:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and always good to
 
02:00:16.689 --> 02:00:16.699 align:start position:0%
see you Mr crease sorry that wasn't very
 
02:00:20.689 --> 02:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
eloquent or uh entertaining
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
flamboyant I'm sure you'll do better
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
next time
 
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
um so I'm thinking about these
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
transmission costs
 
02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
and when a net meter customer let's
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
let's say we have a net metering
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
customer who's netting out to zero so
 
02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:37.139 align:start position:0%
let's say they over the period of time
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh in a billing cycle they produce one
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour but also consume one
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour from the grid
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
during the time that they're producing
 
02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
they're putting money on money
 
02:00:52.609 --> 02:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
electricity onto the onto the grid onto
 
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
the transmission lines as a as a
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
producer but during the time that
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
they're consuming they're actually
 
02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
taking power from the grid as a consumer
 
02:01:04.450 --> 02:01:04.460 align:start position:0%
so should they be charged transmission
 
02:01:06.649 --> 02:01:06.659 align:start position:0%
charges for the time that they're
 
02:01:06.659 --> 02:01:10.070 align:start position:0%
charges for the time that they're
consuming

02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:13.070 --> 02:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
they are under the current net metering
 
02:01:17.089 --> 02:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
tariff so in that sense it's a non-issue
 
02:01:20.089 --> 02:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
what I like about this bill is to the
 
02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
extent that that net metering customer
 
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
is discharging electricity into the grid
 
02:01:28.669 --> 02:01:28.679 align:start position:0%
there's uh the practice of load
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
reconstitution where basically you tell
 
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
ISO New England that in fact that net
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
metering didn't happen that's eliminated
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that's good in terms of the
 
02:01:43.609 --> 02:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
way that we determine what our states
 
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
and our utilities and individually our
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
customers reasonable share of
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
I have a question uh do you know
 
02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:57.169 align:start position:0%
I have a question uh do you know
um

02:01:57.169 --> 02:01:57.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:59.890 --> 02:01:59.900 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
who or what is not able to take
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of net metering under the
 
02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:05.930 align:start position:0%
advantage of net metering under the
current

02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
law does that include the was soon to be
 
02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
Community grouping of
 
02:02:16.609 --> 02:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
a system that's out there I forget the
 
02:02:18.050 --> 02:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
exact name of it but you're talking
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
about Community power Community power
 
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
aggregation uh something like that or
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
are we talking industry or are we
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
talking General household residential
 
02:02:29.330 --> 02:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
well as I said I don't think there are
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
any residential customers who are net
 
02:02:32.689 --> 02:02:32.699 align:start position:0%
metering at the scale of three four or
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
five megawatts so I I think what you're
 
02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
really looking at here is a provision
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
that would benefit frankly commercial
 
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
and Industrial customers who might be
 
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
interested in installing uh a bunch of
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
photovoltaic panels on the roof of their
 
02:02:50.750 --> 02:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
Factory for example or their big big box
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
retail store or their commercial
 
02:02:52.679 --> 02:02:54.950 align:start position:0%
retail store or their commercial
property

02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:03:00.770 --> 02:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
so if I may have a follow-up so uh
 
02:03:05.209 --> 02:03:05.219 align:start position:0%
I we were once told a few years ago that
 
02:03:07.250 --> 02:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
one megawatt
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
basically would power a Super Walmart's
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
type store I don't know if that's still
 
02:03:17.330 --> 02:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
current today but uh so in terms of that
 
02:03:20.089 --> 02:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
um how many businesses do you think we
 
02:03:21.890 --> 02:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
can attract if it was increased to say
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
two megawatts I I really don't know I I
 
02:03:28.129 --> 02:03:28.139 align:start position:0%
apologize but uh generally I try not to
 
02:03:30.050 --> 02:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
pay too much attention to the fate of
 
02:03:32.330 --> 02:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
commercial and Industrial customers not
 
02:03:33.709 --> 02:03:33.719 align:start position:0%
because I don't care about them because
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
obviously we want to have a viable
 
02:03:37.729 --> 02:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
commercial sector in the economy but
 
02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
because I have so much work to do just
 
02:03:41.209 --> 02:03:41.219 align:start position:0%
keeping track of what happens to the
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
I knew the flamboyance would come out
 
02:03:48.169 --> 02:03:48.179 align:start position:0%
there sooner or later
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Reynold
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
actually I representative Winnie Thomas
 
02:03:53.570 --> 02:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
you're new here this morning so I'll
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
call on you first oh thank you very much
 
02:03:56.159 --> 02:03:57.470 align:start position:0%
call on you first oh thank you very much
um

02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:00.410 --> 02:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you for um Mr chair
 
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here um Mr Chris
 
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask for a mini
 
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
historical lesson um if you could tell
 
02:04:10.370 --> 02:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
me how the value of one Mega megawatt
 
02:04:13.490 --> 02:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
was originally decided upon and was it
 
02:04:15.649 --> 02:04:15.659 align:start position:0%
considered a safe number that is no
 
02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
longer applicable to to today's
 
02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:20.169 align:start position:0%
longer applicable to to today's
requirements

02:04:20.169 --> 02:04:20.179 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh I that's a really excellent question
 
02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm not necessarily the best
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
qualified person to answer it I will say
 
02:04:29.689 --> 02:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
this since you asked for a historical
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
lesson uh net metering was invented by
 
02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
accident back in I believe it was the
 
02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
1970s by a guy who decided it was better
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
to ask for forgiveness than permission
 
02:04:43.370 --> 02:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
down in Massachusetts so he wanted to
 
02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
see whether if he wired up a bunch of
 
02:04:48.050 --> 02:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
solar panels to his electric meter at a
 
02:04:49.250 --> 02:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
big apartment building that he was
 
02:04:51.290 --> 02:04:51.300 align:start position:0%
helping to develop whether it would run
 
02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
them run the meter backwards he had no
 
02:04:57.070 --> 02:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
idea and it turns out that it did and
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
initially it amused Boston Edison the
 
02:05:01.609 --> 02:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
local utility because he was the only
 
02:05:04.070 --> 02:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
person who tried it and it was just kind
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
of uh interesting from an engineering
 
02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
perspective the utility started to get
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
really interested in this when it
 
02:05:12.830 --> 02:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
started to significantly affect their
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
load and when lots and lots of people
 
02:05:16.729 --> 02:05:16.739 align:start position:0%
started net metering and so what you've
 
02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
had over time is public policy that's
 
02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
been developed uh I don't want to say by
 
02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
accident but iteratively and I think
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
that that one megawatt limit came in
 
02:05:31.070 --> 02:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
during my Exile period I I hesitate to
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
admit this but there was an eight-year
 
02:05:35.450 --> 02:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
period where I was exiled to a
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
neighboring state whose name I won't
 
02:05:37.199 --> 02:05:38.209 align:start position:0%
neighboring state whose name I won't
mention

02:05:38.209 --> 02:05:38.219 align:start position:0%
mention
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh and at that time I think that you
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
know there was this arbitrary limit the
 
02:05:46.510 --> 02:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
distinction made between net metering of
 
02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh well the distinction is between 100
 
02:05:52.490 --> 02:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
megawatts and one megawatt and then
 
02:05:54.050 --> 02:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
there was this artificial constraint put
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
on one megawatt uh just as a way of
 
02:05:58.850 --> 02:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
making sure that net metering didn't
 
02:06:02.810 --> 02:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
grow in an unconstrained fashion because
 
02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
just like that first fella wasn't sure
 
02:06:07.729 --> 02:06:07.739 align:start position:0%
what would happen if he tried it we have
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
we've been hesitant about what will
 
02:06:11.570 --> 02:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
happen to our grid if we let net
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
metering go uh Hog Wild Hog Wild being
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:23.689 --> 02:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I wanted to ask
 
02:06:28.970 --> 02:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
you if you would let me
 
02:06:31.370 --> 02:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
um not ask a question of Mr crease but
 
02:06:34.070 --> 02:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
offer sort of a response to your
 
02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:34.970 align:start position:0%
offer sort of a response to your
question

02:06:34.970 --> 02:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
which is the type of building there's a
 
02:06:41.890 --> 02:06:41.900 align:start position:0%
for example a large U.S Foods warehouse
 
02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
I'll allow it shortly good thank you
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I mean a short explanation
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
guys there's a there's a large U.S Foods
 
02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
warehouse down in Seabrook whose roof
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
would is such a large Warehouse that it
 
02:06:57.649 --> 02:06:57.659 align:start position:0%
would accommodate
 
02:07:01.729 --> 02:07:01.739 align:start position:0%
five megawatts of solar uh and there are
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
similar buildings in the state things
 
02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
like FW Webb distribution warehouses uh
 
02:07:08.930 --> 02:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
one can imagine you know Amazon
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
warehouses if they're being built that
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
could easily accommodate the scale of
 
02:07:15.770 --> 02:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
generation that were contem that's
 
02:07:17.689 --> 02:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
contemplated by this bill so sort of
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
more distributed generation
 
02:07:22.850 --> 02:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
you know on at various points in the
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
grid right not to get into a discussion
 
02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
I I'd be surprised to see any building
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
rooftop that could accommodate five
 
02:07:31.609 --> 02:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
megawatts but we could probably talk
 
02:07:35.330 --> 02:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
about that offline uh sure but um nope
 
02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:37.430 align:start position:0%
about that offline uh sure but um nope
okay

02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:07:39.770 --> 02:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you Mr
 
02:07:41.689 --> 02:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
Chris thank you so much for putting more
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
entertaining next time all right I'm
 
02:07:44.639 --> 02:07:47.810 align:start position:0%
entertaining next time all right I'm
sure

02:07:47.810 --> 02:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:50.270 --> 02:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
next I'll call on Mr Griffin Roberts
 
02:07:53.330 --> 02:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
from doe Department of
 
02:07:53.340 --> 02:08:06.290 align:start position:0%
from doe Department of
energy

02:08:06.290 --> 02:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:08.450 --> 02:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Thomas members of the
 
02:08:10.490 --> 02:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
committee Griffin robers again strategy
 
02:08:11.930 --> 02:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
program manager at the department of
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
energy the department of energy is
 
02:08:16.930 --> 02:08:16.940 align:start position:0%
respectfully opposed to House Bill
 
02:08:20.570 --> 02:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
2523 as introduced the bill Alters the
 
02:08:22.250 --> 02:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
definition of customer generator and
 
02:08:25.129 --> 02:08:25.139 align:start position:0%
statute currently statute defines a
 
02:08:27.410 --> 02:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
customer generator as one with a total
 
02:08:29.689 --> 02:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
Peak generating capacity of up to and
 
02:08:32.209 --> 02:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
including one megawatt this bill would
 
02:08:33.770 --> 02:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
allow a customer generator to be one
 
02:08:35.209 --> 02:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
with a nameplate or maximum rate
 
02:08:37.490 --> 02:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
capacity of anywhere less than five
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
megawatts the bill largely is a
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
reintroduction of past legislation
 
02:08:43.970 --> 02:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
that's been considered in the past I
 
02:08:45.709 --> 02:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
know the prime sponsor indicated House
 
02:08:49.370 --> 02:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
Bill 365 for 2019 I think there was also
 
02:08:53.450 --> 02:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:55.729 align:start position:0%
 
2018

02:08:55.729 --> 02:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
2018
 
02:08:58.129 --> 02:08:58.139 align:start position:0%
um do we uh respectfully believes the
 
02:08:59.870 --> 02:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
bills proposed changes are a sizable
 
02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
change to the state's net metering
 
02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:03.290 align:start position:0%
change to the state's net metering
statute

02:09:03.290 --> 02:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:09:05.089 --> 02:09:05.099 align:start position:0%
um we would respectfully contend there
 
02:09:07.129 --> 02:09:07.139 align:start position:0%
would be more appropriate for the puc to
 
02:09:09.290 --> 02:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
fully adjudicate its docket uh fully
 
02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicate its docket de-22
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
-060 which is currently underway as the
 
02:09:19.129 --> 02:09:19.139 align:start position:0%
puc considers amendments to the state's
 
02:09:20.930 --> 02:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
net metering tariffs that are applicable
 
02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
to customer generators we would
 
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
respectfully submit letting that process
 
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
play out before making sizable changes
 
02:09:31.010 --> 02:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
to the state's net metering statute
 
02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:31.609 align:start position:0%
to the state's net metering statute
um

02:09:31.609 --> 02:09:31.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:33.649 --> 02:09:33.659 align:start position:0%
with that that really concludes my
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm happy to take any
 
02:09:39.410 --> 02:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative munz yes thank you Mr
 
02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:43.070 align:start position:0%
representative munz yes thank you Mr
chair

02:09:43.070 --> 02:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
um we heard testimony this morning about
 
02:09:48.589 --> 02:09:48.599 align:start position:0%
microgrids would expanding increasing
 
02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
the capacity to five megawatts help in
 
02:09:53.450 --> 02:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
the development of microgrids
 
02:09:55.129 --> 02:09:55.139 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:09:55.139 --> 02:09:56.209 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

02:09:56.209 --> 02:09:56.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer
 
02:10:01.850 --> 02:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
I would I would I would say potentially
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
yes but again I as I mentioned in my
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
previous answer is that there aren't any
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
real active microgrids operating in the
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
state so I can't look at anything as
 
02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
kind of like a case example
 
02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:12.709 align:start position:0%
kind of like a case example
um

02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
I could dig into that a little bit
 
02:10:16.609 --> 02:10:16.619 align:start position:0%
further but I think the answer I'm
 
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative Winnie Thomas thank you
 
02:10:23.570 --> 02:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:10:26.330 --> 02:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
um you say the doe is opposed to this
 
02:10:27.890 --> 02:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
bill because it redefines the term
 
02:10:30.530 --> 02:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
customer generator isn't that one of the
 
02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
points of this Bill yes I thank you for
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
the question so
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
um I think in that statement I was just
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
defining broadly what the bill intended
 
02:10:40.129 --> 02:10:40.139 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:10:40.139 --> 02:10:40.669 align:start position:0%
to do
um

02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
again our Our concern at least with the
 
02:10:44.689 --> 02:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
bill is that there's just an active
 
02:10:46.729 --> 02:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
docket underway that'll be fully
 
02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
adjudicated with a number of
 
02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I think the department
 
02:10:52.669 --> 02:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
feels that letting that process play out
 
02:10:55.129 --> 02:10:55.139 align:start position:0%
before making changes to the state's net
 
02:10:58.070 --> 02:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
metering statute would be uh a good
 
02:10:59.810 --> 02:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
approach to take for policy makers to
 
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
represent none oh no months
 
02:11:10.129 --> 02:11:10.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair sorry I thought of
 
02:11:12.229 --> 02:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
another question after uh you answered
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
my first one
 
02:11:13.679 --> 02:11:14.649 align:start position:0%
my first one
um

02:11:14.649 --> 02:11:14.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:17.649 --> 02:11:17.659 align:start position:0%
except for the concerns that you
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
expressed about
 
02:11:19.679 --> 02:11:20.570 align:start position:0%
expressed about
um

02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:23.629 --> 02:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know the fact that this does
 
02:11:23.639 --> 02:11:25.010 align:start position:0%
uh you know the fact that this does
change

02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:25.729 align:start position:0%
change
um

02:11:25.729 --> 02:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
you know how we handled net metering and
 
02:11:29.810 --> 02:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
and you know wanting to see the puc
 
02:11:33.649 --> 02:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
process play out are there any concerns
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
at all that the department has you know
 
02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
regarding the the capacity of the grid
 
02:11:39.300 --> 02:11:41.030 align:start position:0%
regarding the the capacity of the grid
to

02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
um handle this I mean we hear a lot
 
02:11:46.129 --> 02:11:46.139 align:start position:0%
about how you know there's concern about
 
02:11:46.139 --> 02:11:47.510 align:start position:0%
about how you know there's concern about
expanding

02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
expanding
 
02:11:49.490 --> 02:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
um uh net metering because of the
 
02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
potential impact on the grid I mean do
 
02:11:55.790 --> 02:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
you folks share that concern yeah thank
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
you for the question so the department
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
of energy is an active participant in
 
02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
the puc's docket
 
02:12:03.370 --> 02:12:03.380 align:start position:0%
um again de
 
02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:05.109 align:start position:0%
um again de
22-060

02:12:05.109 --> 02:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
22-060
 
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
we feel that that process will allow for
 
02:12:10.250 --> 02:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
a deeper vetting of that question rather
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
than just an independent party reaching
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
it itself again with the collaborative
 
02:12:16.070 --> 02:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
group of stakeholders who can kind of
 
02:12:17.689 --> 02:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
arrive at that decision that's done
 
02:12:22.189 --> 02:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:24.109 --> 02:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
thank you no other questions thank you
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you I'll call
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
on the last speaker
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.649 --> 02:12:53.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.209 --> 02:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
I would have seen that eventually I
 
02:12:56.219 --> 02:12:57.649 align:start position:0%
I would have seen that eventually I
guess

02:12:57.649 --> 02:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
guess
 
02:13:00.410 --> 02:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
um my name is Paul button I'm a
 
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:02.340 align:start position:0%

02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
I've been a licensed electrician in New
 
02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Massachusetts for close to
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
40 years
 
02:13:24.530 --> 02:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
and my small business is in good

Secretary of State
 
02:13:31.129 --> 02:13:31.139 align:start position:0%
I have a client database of about 2 000
 
02:13:31.139 --> 02:13:32.569 align:start position:0%
I have a client database of about 2 000

02:13:36.169 --> 02:13:36.179 align:start position:0%
and it makes
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
um my business kind of a Nexus
 
02:13:41.930 --> 02:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
for folks taking advantage of the
 
02:13:45.229 --> 02:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
relevant portions of
 
02:13:45.239 --> 02:13:46.069 align:start position:0%
relevant portions of
um

02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
the RPS
 
02:13:52.729 --> 02:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
so I support New Hampshire 523
 
02:13:52.739 --> 02:13:54.709 align:start position:0%
so I support New Hampshire 523
um

02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:58.430 --> 02:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
that seeks to amend our RSA 362
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
from its current outmoded wording
 
02:14:05.569 --> 02:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
to instead state that the name plate or
 
02:14:09.770 --> 02:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
maximum rated capacity of five megawatts
 
02:14:12.350 --> 02:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
less than five minutes
 
02:14:16.910 --> 02:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh my my contention is that um leaving a
 
02:14:20.450 --> 02:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
raise a larger than one megawatt
 
02:14:23.810 --> 02:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
out as ineligible
 
02:14:25.850 --> 02:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
will significantly decrease their
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
overall contribution
 
02:14:30.589 --> 02:14:30.599 align:start position:0%
to the sustainability and the health of
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
the iso New England
 
02:14:34.370 --> 02:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
electric grid
 
02:14:35.930 --> 02:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
so we're not just talking about the
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
state we're talking about a regional
 
02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:40.609 align:start position:0%
state we're talking about a regional
effect

02:14:40.609 --> 02:14:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:40.619 --> 02:14:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:43.970 --> 02:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
this is an obvious attempt by the
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
regional grid operators to maintain
 
02:14:52.189 --> 02:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
their business strategy of complete
 
02:14:52.199 --> 02:14:53.629 align:start position:0%
their business strategy of complete
control

02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the supply of available power
 
02:14:59.330 --> 02:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
and leaves the ordinary citizen of New
 
02:14:59.340 --> 02:15:00.589 align:start position:0%
and leaves the ordinary citizen of New
Hampshire

02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:15:02.689 --> 02:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
very little control
 
02:15:05.089 --> 02:15:05.099 align:start position:0%
over the default costs of obtaining
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
sufficient power
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
and then these costs are passed on to
 
02:15:14.330 --> 02:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and the latest puc approved rate
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:26.689 --> 02:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
I would submit to any lawyers within
 
02:15:29.569 --> 02:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
earshot that this is uh legalized
 
02:15:29.579 --> 02:15:32.270 align:start position:0%
earshot that this is uh legalized
larceny

02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
larceny
 
02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
so I would I would ask our honorable
 
02:15:37.250 --> 02:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
state representatives to dedicate
 
02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
themselves to the work of the people
 
02:15:41.689 --> 02:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
who elected them
 
02:15:44.930 --> 02:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
and not be swayed by the arguments from
 
02:15:48.169 --> 02:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
the army of lawyers and lobbyists that
 
02:15:50.330 --> 02:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
have been deployed by the regional grid
 
02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:51.709 align:start position:0%
have been deployed by the regional grid
operators

02:15:51.709 --> 02:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
operators
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:58.250 --> 02:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:16:00.490 --> 02:16:00.500 align:start position:0%
we have a question from
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
between the two I'll start with
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds
 
02:16:07.250 --> 02:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
I'm thank you for coming here today
 
02:16:12.649 --> 02:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
um just putting a face on the occupation
 
02:16:16.729 --> 02:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
of the independent monitor who certifies
 
02:16:19.550 --> 02:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
the Rex production of wrecks going into
 
02:16:21.890 --> 02:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
the grid can you just comment I was
 
02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
astounded when you said your Client List
 
02:16:28.729 --> 02:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
exceeds 2 000 are there without you can
 
02:16:30.410 --> 02:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
name names if you want but can you
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
characterize the are are there
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
characterize your client base are there
 
02:16:37.730 --> 02:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
public entities on there yes school
 
02:16:41.770 --> 02:16:41.780 align:start position:0%
systems yes uh County governments yes
 
02:16:45.049 --> 02:16:45.059 align:start position:0%
municipalities yes
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
anymore those are good follow-up
 
02:16:50.330 --> 02:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
questions yes thank you I think we'll no
 
02:16:54.169 --> 02:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
that's okay do you want me to to give
 
02:16:56.509 --> 02:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
you a kind of an overview or yes okay
 
02:16:56.519 --> 02:16:57.770 align:start position:0%
you a kind of an overview or yes okay
capsule

02:16:57.770 --> 02:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
capsule
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
um I do have several uh municipalities
 
02:17:05.089 --> 02:17:05.099 align:start position:0%
sandwiched on a sandwich town at
 
02:17:05.099 --> 02:17:06.650 align:start position:0%
sandwiched on a sandwich town at
wolfborough

02:17:06.650 --> 02:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
wolfborough
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I also have some corporate uh clients
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
um one is a fairly large
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
they have uh respectively 200 megawatt
 
02:17:28.129 --> 02:17:28.139 align:start position:0%
200 200 megawatt 200 kilowatt array and
 
02:17:30.889 --> 02:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
a 400 kilowatt array
 
02:17:33.290 --> 02:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
I suggested to them that they maybe
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
don't need my services since they're so
 
02:17:41.690 --> 02:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
big that they could do something called
 
02:17:45.169 --> 02:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
Auto reporting which would be a simple
 
02:17:47.570 --> 02:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
module add-on to their software that
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
would simply report to the National
 
02:17:53.169 --> 02:17:53.179 align:start position:0%
Database that's the function that I do
 
02:17:56.750 --> 02:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
and they said no no we want you to we
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
want you to do it I said Okay
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
um Comcast is also a client they have a
 
02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:06.599 align:start position:0%
400 kilowatt array on their parking
 
02:18:06.599 --> 02:18:07.610 align:start position:0%
400 kilowatt array on their parking
garage

02:18:07.610 --> 02:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
garage
 
02:18:11.870 --> 02:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
Pine Island Pond I think it is pylotted
 
02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:12.830 align:start position:0%
Pine Island Pond I think it is pylotted
um

02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean they
 
02:18:17.450 --> 02:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
and then I also have one of my first
 
02:18:20.570 --> 02:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
clients was actually Unitil
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
um the Exeter High School
 
02:18:25.849 --> 02:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
and that is 100 kilowatt array
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
and size wise
 
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a soccer field
 
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
little bit bigger than a football field
 
02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
so size wise if you want to get what a
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
one megawatt
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
array would be
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
you can effectively multiply that
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
football field a soccer field by 10. so
 
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
you know the the idea of having
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of land in the backyard well yeah
 
02:18:57.709 --> 02:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
it would take a lot of land to put
 
02:18:59.450 --> 02:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
something up like that
 
02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going to go to the okay
 
02:19:03.770 --> 02:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh well representative
 
02:19:06.889 --> 02:19:06.899 align:start position:0%
Harrington you're uh your next yeah I'm
 
02:19:08.450 --> 02:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
just trying to uh get a little bit more
 
02:19:09.830 --> 02:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
about where you're coming from on this
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
your background it sounds and correct me
 
02:19:14.509 --> 02:19:14.519 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but it sounds as if your
 
02:19:16.969 --> 02:19:16.979 align:start position:0%
business would increase and your profits
 
02:19:19.310 --> 02:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
increase if this bill would pass yeah
 
02:19:21.469 --> 02:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
this this is true I'm not here to
 
02:19:23.929 --> 02:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
promote my business promote the
 
02:19:23.939 --> 02:19:25.009 align:start position:0%
promote my business promote the
well-being

02:19:25.009 --> 02:19:25.019 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
and physical stability of the of the
 
02:19:30.049 --> 02:19:30.059 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire
 
02:19:30.059 --> 02:19:31.910 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire

02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative munz
 
02:19:38.030 --> 02:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
of um thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh coming in and giving us your
 
02:19:39.359 --> 02:19:40.370 align:start position:0%
uh coming in and giving us your
perspective

02:19:40.370 --> 02:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
of your ex within your existing client
 
02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
base are there clients that have
 
02:19:48.770 --> 02:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
expressed to you a desire to want to
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
expand Beyond
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
what oh sure now you have to understand
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
a majority of my clients are
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
residentials okay so ordinary folks
 
02:19:59.040 --> 02:19:59.810 align:start position:0%
residentials okay so ordinary folks
um

02:19:59.810 --> 02:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:02.690 --> 02:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
and the the average size of of the array
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
is about uh 10 kilowatts is that that's
 
02:20:09.170 --> 02:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
fairly big as far as a residential
 
02:20:09.180 --> 02:20:10.849 align:start position:0%
fairly big as far as a residential
install

02:20:10.849 --> 02:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
install
 
02:20:10.859 --> 02:20:12.230 align:start position:0%
install
um

02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
but again it runs through the range so
 
02:20:17.090 --> 02:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
people might start off small and I
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
caution people that
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
um anything less than five kilowatts is
 
02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
really kind of it I mean it's it's worth
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
it it's the problem is is that
 
02:20:28.310 --> 02:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
a raise less than five kilowatts will
 
02:20:33.170 --> 02:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
produce renewable energy certificates
 
02:20:35.810 --> 02:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
very slowly so they're not going to see
 
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
that return on investment immediately so
 
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
I just try to you know make sure that I
 
02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
set their expectations up front
 
02:20:46.190 --> 02:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and they they do they when they see
 
02:20:50.929 --> 02:20:50.939 align:start position:0%
that they can make a few dollars it's
 
02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
not a lot of money
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
thanks to the efforts of
 
02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
the utilities
 
02:20:58.429 --> 02:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
um they've nibbled away at the value of
 
02:21:00.410 --> 02:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
the wrecks over the years when I started
 
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
the business
 
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
um the wreck's worth about 55 dollars a
 
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
piece now they're going for about 30.
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
and they were down as low as five
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
dollars a piece thank you
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
all right uh I think uh we've asked
 
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
enough questions of this gentlemen uh I
 
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
think it's time to move on thank you so
 
02:21:21.170 --> 02:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
much so very enlightening on what you do
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
very good I'm going to call our our last
 
02:21:26.770 --> 02:21:26.780 align:start position:0%
speaker of the morning Mr
 
02:21:32.330 --> 02:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
Nicholas Leiden or Linden Leyden
 
02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:39.530 align:start position:0%
Nicholas Leiden or Linden Leyden
ah

02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:41.570 --> 02:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me the opportunity
 
02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
to speak this morning
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
um with IBEW Local 490 we're the inside
 
02:21:48.050 --> 02:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
Wireman local for New Hampshire
 
02:21:48.060 --> 02:21:48.770 align:start position:0%
Wireman local for New Hampshire
um

02:21:48.770 --> 02:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
I wanted to speak specifically to this
 
02:21:53.150 --> 02:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
bill uh on
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
not just the environmental impact of
 
02:21:57.650 --> 02:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
increasing generation but the jobs
 
02:21:57.660 --> 02:21:58.790 align:start position:0%
increasing generation but the jobs
impact

02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh we do have Associated Grocers over in
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
Pembroke we did a uh an array on their
 
02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:06.770 align:start position:0%
Pembroke we did a uh an array on their
facility

02:22:06.770 --> 02:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
we could only do one megawatt it
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
basically is a giant refrigerator they
 
02:22:13.969 --> 02:22:13.979 align:start position:0%
use a ton of power over there we could
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
have gone bigger but it they wouldn't
 
02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
have gotten any net metering out of it
 
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
so it didn't make any sense so
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
I'd say about a quarter of their roof
 
02:22:25.490 --> 02:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
was filled and the rest is vacant
 
02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:26.330 align:start position:0%
was filled and the rest is vacant
um

02:22:26.330 --> 02:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:28.370 --> 02:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
they're not the only one another one of
 
02:22:29.929 --> 02:22:29.939 align:start position:0%
our customers Anheuser-Busch out of
 
02:22:32.330 --> 02:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
Merrimack has for years talked about
 
02:22:33.950 --> 02:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
wanting to put a solar array down there
 
02:22:36.889 --> 02:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
to offset their operating costs they
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
just can't build one big enough
 
02:22:41.570 --> 02:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
to offset enough to make it worthwhile
 
02:22:42.830 --> 02:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
for them
 
02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:44.090 align:start position:0%
for them
um

02:22:44.090 --> 02:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:45.889 --> 02:22:45.899 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of schools we did the
 
02:22:48.290 --> 02:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
Dover school which at the time was the
 
02:22:50.690 --> 02:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
largest Rooftop in the state
 
02:22:52.370 --> 02:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
they could have gone a little bit bigger
 
02:22:52.380 --> 02:22:53.750 align:start position:0%
they could have gone a little bit bigger
but

02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:22:56.450 --> 02:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
it was about as big as we could go on
 
02:22:58.969 --> 02:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
their roof uh
 
02:23:01.130 --> 02:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
you've got other businesses like Lawns
 
02:23:03.530 --> 02:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals down in Portsmouth that
 
02:23:05.389 --> 02:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
have talked about doing a large solar
 
02:23:07.610 --> 02:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
array these are
 
02:23:10.250 --> 02:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
yes they're not your homeowners but
 
02:23:12.830 --> 02:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
there are a good number of industrial
 
02:23:14.750 --> 02:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
scale and Commercial scale facilities
 
02:23:16.849 --> 02:23:16.859 align:start position:0%
out there that are interested in putting
 
02:23:20.270 --> 02:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
large systems on there and
 
02:23:23.090 --> 02:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
speaking of Anheuser-Busch they've had
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
cutbacks on their
 
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
their budgets for this year so there are
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
people over there that are working that
 
02:23:32.510 --> 02:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
aren't getting a full 40 hours
 
02:23:35.150 --> 02:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
it's an assumption but if they had an
 
02:23:36.770 --> 02:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
array that was lowering their operating
 
02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
costs they might not have to cut back on
 
02:23:42.110 --> 02:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
those workers as much so you'd be saving
 
02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
in other ports of their other parts of
 
02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
their their budgets
 
02:23:46.260 --> 02:23:48.230 align:start position:0%
their their budgets
um

02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:51.770 --> 02:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
usually the going trend is to give
 
02:23:54.349 --> 02:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
corporations tax breaks to help them
 
02:23:56.690 --> 02:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
grow and to help them succeed
 
02:23:58.730 --> 02:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
this is essentially giving them a break
 
02:24:00.650 --> 02:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
that is not in the form of a tax break
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
but it is going to lower their operating
 
02:24:04.969 --> 02:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
costs and allow some of these businesses
 
02:24:06.889 --> 02:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to expand in the future
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
with the savings that they would get
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
from these systems
 
02:24:18.770 --> 02:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.290 --> 02:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:24:26.090 --> 02:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question just so we're clear
 
02:24:28.010 --> 02:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that prevents anybody
 
02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
from building something larger than one
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
megawatt they just can't do it with net
 
02:24:35.450 --> 02:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
metering for instance I think Fidelity
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
put in one that was I believe it was
 
02:24:40.250 --> 02:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
over 10 megawatts they had I don't know
 
02:24:42.889 --> 02:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
12 acres of solar panels which I guess
 
02:24:44.270 --> 02:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
turns out to be about three or four
 
02:24:46.370 --> 02:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
megawatts somewhere in that vicinity so
 
02:24:48.410 --> 02:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
it certainly can be done you just don't
 
02:24:49.969 --> 02:24:49.979 align:start position:0%
be able to take you don't be able to
 
02:24:51.469 --> 02:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
sell the electricity back through net
 
02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
metering but there's nothing that
 
02:24:54.889 --> 02:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
prevents an industry from putting up 50
 
02:24:56.809 --> 02:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
megawatts if they wanted to
 
02:24:58.730 --> 02:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
02:25:00.290 --> 02:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
I believe that there are actually
 
02:25:02.330 --> 02:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the total size of array
 
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:25:05.809 --> 02:25:05.819 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we build arrays that are
 
02:25:05.819 --> 02:25:07.250 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we build arrays that are
over

02:25:07.250 --> 02:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:25:09.290 --> 02:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
um five megawatts right now at least I
 
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
haven't seen one that's gone through
 
02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:11.870 align:start position:0%
haven't seen one that's gone through
commercially

02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
commercially
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
they were over 5 megawatts would have to
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
be metered through ISO New England as a
 
02:25:16.849 --> 02:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
generator but they could still be built
 
02:25:16.859 --> 02:25:20.929 align:start position:0%
generator but they could still be built
correct

02:25:20.929 --> 02:25:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:20.939 --> 02:25:23.090 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:25:23.090 --> 02:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:26.210 align:start position:0%
representative
McWilliams

02:25:26.210 --> 02:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um and thank you for
 
02:25:29.210 --> 02:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
your testimony today I think this is
 
02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
really helpful for us to understand the
 
02:25:33.770 --> 02:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
face of of the folks who are facing some
 
02:25:36.170 --> 02:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
challenges here I want to understand a
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
little bit more about
 
02:25:37.439 --> 02:25:38.270 align:start position:0%
little bit more about
um

02:25:38.270 --> 02:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:40.190 --> 02:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
what it would look like for a facility
 
02:25:42.290 --> 02:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
that currently has one megawatt and
 
02:25:43.790 --> 02:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
would like to expand to say three
 
02:25:45.650 --> 02:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
megawatts and can't because they're
 
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
capped at one Meg while right now
 
02:25:48.530 --> 02:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
although this enabling bill would allow
 
02:25:52.849 --> 02:25:52.859 align:start position:0%
4.99 is there anything that's uh
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
that would need to be accounted for to
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
do a second project or was the first
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
megawatt the only bite at the Apple
 
02:26:01.130 --> 02:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
that's really allowed just in terms of
 
02:26:03.469 --> 02:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
expansion so I can understand how the
 
02:26:04.849 --> 02:26:04.859 align:start position:0%
market works
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
I mean in terms of yeah in terms of
 
02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:08.330 align:start position:0%
I mean in terms of yeah in terms of
expanding

02:26:08.330 --> 02:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
expanding
 
02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:09.230 align:start position:0%
expanding
um

02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:10.969 --> 02:26:10.979 align:start position:0%
these buildings are already designed
 
02:26:13.370 --> 02:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
with their services to consume enough
 
02:26:15.469 --> 02:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
power to power themselves so if they are
 
02:26:17.870 --> 02:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
offsetting their costs directly then
 
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
they already have the infrastructure
 
02:26:21.170 --> 02:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
there you just have to add more of an
 
02:26:23.690 --> 02:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
array more inverters but the the
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is already there for them
 
02:26:27.290 --> 02:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
to kick that amount of power back onto
 
02:26:30.170 --> 02:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
the grid so for a lot of these companies
 
02:26:32.690 --> 02:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
it was just a matter of they wouldn't be
 
02:26:35.090 --> 02:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
offset the net metering
 
02:26:37.130 --> 02:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
to go bigger than the one megawatt that
 
02:26:39.650 --> 02:26:39.660 align:start position:0%
they did follow up
 
02:26:41.330 --> 02:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:26:44.450 --> 02:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
um so so for some of these really large
 
02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:45.710 align:start position:0%
um so so for some of these really large
facilities

02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
02:26:48.830 --> 02:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're not current ly using
 
02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
they're not currently creating their
 
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
Macs for the the amount that they need
 
02:26:56.809 --> 02:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
therefore they're still paying the usual
 
02:26:59.150 --> 02:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
electric charge rather than net metering
 
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
because they just can't get where they
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
need to get to to potentially completely
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
cover the load and it sounds like that's
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
really the challenge here is that we
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
have large corporations that are
 
02:27:11.090 --> 02:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
struggling and are dealing with you know
 
02:27:13.309 --> 02:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
100 increase on their electric bills and
 
02:27:14.929 --> 02:27:14.939 align:start position:0%
maybe that means layoffs right in the
 
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
case of he said Anheuser-Busch so this
 
02:27:19.730 --> 02:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
could be seen as a potential business
 
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
enabling Bill to allow them to do what
 
02:27:24.170 --> 02:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
they need to do to cover those electric
 
02:27:24.180 --> 02:27:26.090 align:start position:0%
they need to do to cover those electric
costs

02:27:26.090 --> 02:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:27:28.429 --> 02:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
um have you seen any facilities that are
 
02:27:30.770 --> 02:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
doing this on parking lots
 
02:27:32.330 --> 02:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
um I know we talked about the size of a
 
02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
backyard you know you need something
 
02:27:35.990 --> 02:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
like 25 acres for five minutes could we
 
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
could we shorten it to a question please
 
02:27:40.130 --> 02:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely so can you just explain
 
02:27:42.349 --> 02:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
if you have some folks in your stable
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
who would be able to expand Beyond
 
02:27:45.650 --> 02:27:45.660 align:start position:0%
rooftop to parking lot or other
 
02:27:46.969 --> 02:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that they've looked at
 
02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
because I think we're really limiting
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
ourselves when we say it's a yard
 
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
correct yes uh Anheuser-Busch would not
 
02:27:54.170 --> 02:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
be a rooftop facility they would have to
 
02:27:56.570 --> 02:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
build an array on the property off of
 
02:27:57.770 --> 02:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
their rooftop
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
um there are some other large
 
02:28:02.690 --> 02:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
manufacturing I mean Associated Grocers
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
is just an enormous building so they'd
 
02:28:06.110 --> 02:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
be able to satisfy their needs on their
 
02:28:09.290 --> 02:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
roof but there are other
 
02:28:12.889 --> 02:28:12.899 align:start position:0%
corporations out there that have land
 
02:28:14.570 --> 02:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
adjacent to their area where they could
 
02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
build a a ground Mount array to offset
 
02:28:20.450 --> 02:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
their costs also thank you
 
02:28:22.910 --> 02:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
um if there's different questions I'll
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
take one more I think we've establish
 
02:28:26.330 --> 02:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
the fact that there are a lot of
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
entities out there that would like to
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
take advantage of net metering if they
 
02:28:31.969 --> 02:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
were could be allowed to build a larger
 
02:28:34.730 --> 02:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
array and and sell more electricity back
 
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
to the power companies which in turn
 
02:28:38.570 --> 02:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
have to accept that as part of their
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
cost of doing business but is there a
 
02:28:42.830 --> 02:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
different question to have a question
 
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative Summers okay go ahead
 
02:28:47.090 --> 02:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I believe this is
 
02:28:47.100 --> 02:28:48.469 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I believe this is
different

02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
um so if I'm wrong please forgive me
 
02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:52.969 align:start position:0%
um so if I'm wrong please forgive me
um

02:28:52.969 --> 02:28:52.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly and I'm just
 
02:28:56.450 --> 02:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
going to ask you a question on this with
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
the corporation as you mentioned
 
02:29:00.830 --> 02:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
Anheuser-Busch went up to four megawatts
 
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
if this bill did not pass and the limit
 
02:29:05.809 --> 02:29:05.819 align:start position:0%
for net metering was still one megawatt
 
02:29:08.330 --> 02:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
with four megawatts would they still
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
would they not still be able to save
 
02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
money on their electric bill with the
 
02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
so you're saying under current terms
 
02:29:22.610 --> 02:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
with the one megawatt would they still
 
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
if they were gen I'm sorry I don't know
 
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
um if they are if they build four
 
02:29:32.809 --> 02:29:32.819 align:start position:0%
megawatts of solar panels and they're
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
utilizing it for their business would
 
02:29:37.370 --> 02:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
that not lower their electrical cost
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
generating four megawatts of power for
 
02:29:42.590 --> 02:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
their business even if this bill stayed
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
they would still be able to build an
 
02:29:51.710 --> 02:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
array of that size uh as far as my
 
02:29:54.050 --> 02:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
knowledge on what you get more for as a
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
power generator or as Net Zero that I'm
 
02:29:58.190 --> 02:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
not as familiar as some other people
 
02:30:00.170 --> 02:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
with but I know from the conversations
 
02:30:02.450 --> 02:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
that we have had with them they would
 
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:09.530 --> 02:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
if if I may for clarification the way I
 
02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
understood it let's say the company
 
02:30:15.950 --> 02:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
let's say their business only uses one
 
02:30:18.170 --> 02:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
megawatt and they don't intend to expand
 
02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
so let's say they go they they they're
 
02:30:22.429 --> 02:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
always applying all their power with one
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
megawatt but if they build a four
 
02:30:26.170 --> 02:30:26.180 align:start position:0%
megawatt array
 
02:30:29.210 --> 02:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
they don't need an extra megawatt to run
 
02:30:30.650 --> 02:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
their business but they would be able to
 
02:30:33.469 --> 02:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
sell it back to the edge company if we
 
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
were to pass this bill
 
02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise they wouldn't be able to sell
 
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
it back correct
 
02:30:43.010 --> 02:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
and yeah as far as access for Net Zero
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
that I'm not as familiar with
 
02:30:47.210 --> 02:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
um I know the issue that we've run into
 
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
with them is that they need more than
 
02:30:51.650 --> 02:30:51.660 align:start position:0%
one megawatt in order to offset their
 
02:30:53.389 --> 02:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
total operating costs
 
02:30:53.399 --> 02:30:54.650 align:start position:0%
total operating costs
um

02:30:54.650 --> 02:30:54.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:57.889 --> 02:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
I don't know rates as far as if you
 
02:30:59.690 --> 02:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
exceed what you can produce what you'll
 
02:31:01.250 --> 02:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
get back
 
02:31:01.260 --> 02:31:02.450 align:start position:0%
get back
um

02:31:02.450 --> 02:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
that part of it I'm not as familiar with
 
02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
okay what I'm I'll talk offline thank
 
02:31:11.570 --> 02:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
you uh it's
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
um operating costs versus their
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
electricity costs could be two different
 
02:31:17.570 --> 02:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
things but I'll I can talk to you
 
02:31:17.580 --> 02:31:21.469 align:start position:0%
things but I'll I can talk to you
offline

02:31:21.469 --> 02:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:23.450 --> 02:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you so
 
02:31:23.460 --> 02:31:24.830 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you so
much

02:31:24.830 --> 02:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:31:27.710 --> 02:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
and having no other bills
 
02:31:29.450 --> 02:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
no other speakers
 
02:31:33.650 --> 02:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
I'm closing HB 523
 
02:31:36.650 --> 02:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
and we'll ask for the blue sheet report
 
02:31:40.250 --> 02:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
from representative closure
 
02:31:42.290 --> 02:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
523 the blue sheet was five in support
 
02:31:50.570 --> 02:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
none opposed online
 
02:31:55.090 --> 02:31:55.100 align:start position:0%
do 65 in support two oppose no neutral
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh so 11 30 not bad
 
02:32:03.050 --> 02:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
for the bills we had this morning I
 
02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:04.270 align:start position:0%
for the bills we had this morning I
appreciate

04:04:23.450 --> 04:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody I want to
 
04:04:33.530 --> 04:04:33.540 align:start position:0%

but before we begin that we have a
 
04:04:43.250 --> 04:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
couple of announcements I'd like to call
 
04:04:45.410 --> 04:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
on representative McWilliams for an
 
04:04:47.150 --> 04:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
announcement thank you so much chair
 
04:04:49.250 --> 04:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
Vose I'd like to give an update to the
 
04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
committee regarding
 
04:04:53.389 --> 04:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
um ranking member Kat McGee as you all
 
04:04:55.010 --> 04:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
may know she's been out for health
 
04:04:55.020 --> 04:04:56.150 align:start position:0%
may know she's been out for health
reasons

04:04:56.150 --> 04:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
04:04:59.630 --> 04:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
um and uh she had a very successful
 
04:05:02.689 --> 04:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
surgery and she's officially cancer
 
04:05:06.050 --> 04:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
clear lymph nodes are negative so she's
 
04:05:07.969 --> 04:05:07.979 align:start position:0%
in a really great spot right now for
 
04:05:10.070 --> 04:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
recovery and we're looking forward to
 
04:05:12.590 --> 04:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
seeing her hopefully fingers crossed in
 
04:05:14.330 --> 04:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
four weeks or so if everything goes well
 
04:05:15.769 --> 04:05:15.779 align:start position:0%
with her health so this is really
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
exciting that she's cancer-free right
 
04:05:18.769 --> 04:05:18.779 align:start position:0%
now I just wanted to share that with
 
04:05:18.779 --> 04:05:20.030 align:start position:0%
now I just wanted to share that with
everyone

04:05:20.030 --> 04:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:05:22.189 --> 04:05:22.199 align:start position:0%

04:05:40.729 --> 04:05:40.739 align:start position:0%
um uh folks are going to have a couple
 
04:05:42.950 --> 04:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
of reps here from AmeriGas which we'll
 
04:05:46.010 --> 04:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
talk about uh their um
 
04:05:49.010 --> 04:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
their situation and also some corrective
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
action that they are proposing they'll
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
also be members from at least three
 
04:05:56.570 --> 04:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
other propane companies here as well to
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
um answer questions about uh charges and
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
so uh everybody is welcome to come uh in
 
04:06:07.490 --> 04:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
addition to the subcommittee members
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
that's that one the second one is I just
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
want to have a uh either show of hands
 
04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
or not a support whatever we have an
 
04:06:18.710 --> 04:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity coming up here uh in a
 
04:06:20.030 --> 04:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks for when we have the
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
week off and uh although I won't be here
 
04:06:26.269 --> 04:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
after uh March 2nd There's an
 
04:06:28.070 --> 04:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for maybe a Monday or a
 
04:06:30.769 --> 04:06:30.779 align:start position:0%
Tuesday if anyone would like to have
 
04:06:33.969 --> 04:06:33.979 align:start position:0%
some additional education presentation
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
one of the suggestions that was made to
 
04:06:38.650 --> 04:06:38.660 align:start position:0%
me was maybe having a presentation here
 
04:06:42.110 --> 04:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
on more of the details on net metering
 
04:06:46.189 --> 04:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
or maybe a presentation on on the report
 
04:06:48.769 --> 04:06:48.779 align:start position:0%
that was sent out on net metering and
 
04:06:50.929 --> 04:06:50.939 align:start position:0%
the costs involved of it to maybe a
 
04:06:52.849 --> 04:06:52.859 align:start position:0%
little more depth of information we
 
04:06:54.410 --> 04:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
might be able to offer that or we could
 
04:06:56.090 --> 04:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
offer whatever else someone else might
 
04:06:59.450 --> 04:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
choose that they they may want to so the
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
first question would be if anyone would
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
like to be here on that week that we
 
04:07:06.889 --> 04:07:06.899 align:start position:0%
have no committee meeting if there's
 
04:07:09.290 --> 04:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
interest in that then we can proceed you
 
04:07:11.450 --> 04:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
can we can have a preliminary show of
 
04:07:13.250 --> 04:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
hands now if anybody would want to be
 
04:07:16.490 --> 04:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
here on that Monday or Tuesday and he I
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
know I could be
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
seems Seems like there'll be enough
 
04:07:22.610 --> 04:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
people that we could
 
04:07:25.130 --> 04:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
present something so we'll we'll ask
 
04:07:27.170 --> 04:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
about that first or some other subject
 
04:07:28.969 --> 04:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
that might be better and then be
 
04:07:32.090 --> 04:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
thinking about the springtime when we
 
04:07:34.010 --> 04:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
may this is when we traditionally make
 
04:07:37.450 --> 04:07:37.460 align:start position:0%
some uh trips
 
04:07:39.950 --> 04:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
in the past we've we've been to the more
 
04:07:42.650 --> 04:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
Dam up Beyond Littleton to look at the
 
04:07:45.229 --> 04:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
Hydro power we've been to uh we haven't
 
04:07:46.969 --> 04:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
been to the natural gas plant in
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
Londonderry in well over four years that
 
04:07:51.170 --> 04:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
might be an option Seabrook is always an
 
04:07:52.969 --> 04:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
option they get they give a great tour
 
04:07:52.979 --> 04:07:53.950 align:start position:0%
option they get they give a great tour
there

04:07:53.950 --> 04:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:07:57.729 --> 04:07:57.739 align:start position:0%
there are several solar
 
04:08:00.530 --> 04:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
arrays that we could visit
 
04:08:02.570 --> 04:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
um you can look at glass I guess and and
 
04:08:04.969 --> 04:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
see uh how they set up their their
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
system there or something else that
 
04:08:09.170 --> 04:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
might uh be good that affects our
 
04:08:11.330 --> 04:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
committee so be thinking about that as
 
04:08:14.330 --> 04:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
well uh because we need to plan for that
 
04:08:16.130 --> 04:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:08:18.830 --> 04:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
okay that's it
 
04:08:21.710 --> 04:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
all right thank you one quick last
 
04:08:24.410 --> 04:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
announcement we have a card here we're
 
04:08:25.849 --> 04:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
going to pass it around we'd like you
 
04:08:27.769 --> 04:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
all to sign it we're going to send it to
 
04:08:31.729 --> 04:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
John lewicki to wish him uh continued
 
04:08:33.889 --> 04:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
success in his recovery
 
04:08:36.170 --> 04:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
we now have an address where you can
 
04:08:38.030 --> 04:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
send cards I sent that out over the
 
04:08:40.790 --> 04:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
weekend to all members and if you'd like
 
04:08:42.469 --> 04:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
to send your own personal card feel free
 
04:08:43.550 --> 04:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
04:08:45.170 --> 04:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
but we will send a card from the
 
04:08:45.180 --> 04:08:47.389 align:start position:0%
but we will send a card from the
committee

04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
so with that now we can begin the
 
04:08:51.710 --> 04:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
business of executive sessions so I'm
 
04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
going to open an executive executive
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 175.
 
04:09:01.370 --> 04:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
and call on representative Thomas for a
 
04:09:01.380 --> 04:09:04.370 align:start position:0%
and call on representative Thomas for a
motion

04:09:04.370 --> 04:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:08.330 --> 04:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair uh I motion to retain HP
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
175 representative Bernardi is
 
04:09:14.450 --> 04:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
recognized I second that motion
 
04:09:16.189 --> 04:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
retain House Bill 175 is there any
 
04:09:18.840 --> 04:09:21.830 align:start position:0%
retain House Bill 175 is there any
discussion

04:09:21.830 --> 04:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.809 --> 04:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
04:09:25.490 --> 04:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm just curious
 
04:09:27.710 --> 04:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh what do we hope to accomplish by
 
04:09:30.170 --> 04:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
retaining it
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
typically when you retain a bill you
 
04:09:34.189 --> 04:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
hold on to it over the summer and then
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the fall you discuss it again to see
 
04:09:38.830 --> 04:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
if there is anything that can be done
 
04:09:41.689 --> 04:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
relative to the subject of the bill and
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
so that would be the purpose of routine
 
04:09:48.050 --> 04:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up yeah so I mean that
 
04:09:49.550 --> 04:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
I understand the question is for the
 
04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
specific bill I mean we were told that
 
04:09:53.929 --> 04:09:53.939 align:start position:0%
the greenhouse gas target has already
 
04:09:56.809 --> 04:09:56.819 align:start position:0%
been met so I don't understand what
 
04:09:58.849 --> 04:09:58.859 align:start position:0%
could be further gained by retaining the
 
04:09:58.859 --> 04:10:01.670 align:start position:0%
could be further gained by retaining the
bill

04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:03.590 --> 04:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure either but that's always
 
04:10:07.070 --> 04:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
what uh the investigations in the fall
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
seek to reveal if there is anything
 
04:10:13.790 --> 04:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:16.370 --> 04:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
04:10:18.710 --> 04:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you chervos to follow up on
 
04:10:21.110 --> 04:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative corman's comment I think
 
04:10:22.969 --> 04:10:22.979 align:start position:0%
there is an opportunity if we retain
 
04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
this bill to strengthen the goals
 
04:10:27.110 --> 04:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
um perhaps to increase our Target
 
04:10:29.929 --> 04:10:29.939 align:start position:0%
numbers for uh State departments to
 
04:10:33.110 --> 04:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
reduce fossil fuels and also potentially
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
to add fleet vehicles as part of the
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas goals targets so I think
 
04:10:38.929 --> 04:10:38.939 align:start position:0%
there's something here I think we could
 
04:10:40.610 --> 04:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
probably work on it if we chose to do so
 
04:10:43.729 --> 04:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
as a committee thank you
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the motion to
 
04:10:51.349 --> 04:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
04:10:54.950 --> 04:10:54.960 align:start position:0%

04:10:58.729 --> 04:10:58.739 align:start position:0%

04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
Henry Noel
 
04:11:40.319 --> 04:11:41.510 align:start position:0%
Henry Noel
yes

04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:11:44.330 --> 04:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas yes
 
04:11:47.090 --> 04:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
Thomas Corman yes
 
04:11:51.050 --> 04:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:54.110 --> 04:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose yes
 
04:11:59.090 --> 04:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
so 18 to Zero by a vote of 18 to zero
 
04:12:02.210 --> 04:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
House Bill 175 is retained by the
 
04:12:02.220 --> 04:12:03.110 align:start position:0%
House Bill 175 is retained by the
committee

04:12:03.110 --> 04:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:12:05.630 --> 04:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
so I'll close the exact session on House
 
04:12:08.809 --> 04:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
Bill 175 and remind the committee that
 
04:12:11.269 --> 04:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
we will not be discussing this bill
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
again until the fall
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
now with that I'll now open an exact
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 176 relative to
 
04:12:21.530 --> 04:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
the rules of the site evaluation
 
04:12:23.809 --> 04:12:23.819 align:start position:0%
committee and recognize representative
 
04:12:26.689 --> 04:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
Thomas for a motion
 
04:12:26.699 --> 04:12:28.490 align:start position:0%
Thomas for a motion
okay

okay
 
04:12:28.500 --> 04:12:29.929 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

04:12:29.929 --> 04:12:29.939 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:12:33.170 --> 04:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
oh I was working yours for a while so I
 
04:12:36.769 --> 04:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
uh I make motion for wage view 176 to
 
04:12:36.779 --> 04:12:38.450 align:start position:0%
uh I make motion for wage view 176 to
retain

04:12:38.450 --> 04:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
retain
 
04:12:41.150 --> 04:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi I second the
 
04:12:43.010 --> 04:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
motion it's been moved and seconded that
 
04:12:46.429 --> 04:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
we retain House Bill 176 is there any
 
04:12:46.439 --> 04:12:51.530 align:start position:0%
we retain House Bill 176 is there any
discussion

04:12:51.530 --> 04:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:54.769 --> 04:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
04:12:56.510 --> 04:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
press the record this one is in regards
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
to the rules for the site evaluation
 
04:13:00.950 --> 04:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee I do think that we have some
 
04:13:02.929 --> 04:13:02.939 align:start position:0%
opportunities to make this a stronger
 
04:13:06.290 --> 04:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
bill as well I also think that we could
 
04:13:08.689 --> 04:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
have some interesting testimony if we
 
04:13:10.729 --> 04:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
chose to from Gel car to understand
 
04:13:14.210 --> 04:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
exactly how the current legislation and
 
04:13:16.250 --> 04:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
rules work and see if there are
 
04:13:18.650 --> 04:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
redundancies or potential conflicts so I
 
04:13:19.849 --> 04:13:19.859 align:start position:0%
think there's some work to be done here
 
04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be good to retain
 
04:13:24.050 --> 04:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:27.769 --> 04:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:30.170 --> 04:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
I would Echo representative McWilliams
 
04:13:32.090 --> 04:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
comments that there is further work to
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:40.670 --> 04:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
week or so can't remember the exact date
 
04:13:43.610 --> 04:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
a major Bill to reorganize the site
 
04:13:46.610 --> 04:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and it might be
 
04:13:48.950 --> 04:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
better to hear that bill before
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
proceeding further with this bill which
 
04:13:54.170 --> 04:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
would be another reason to retain it
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
so that would be I think a worthy
 
04:14:00.170 --> 04:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
recommendation for this committee any
 
04:14:05.090 --> 04:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.889 --> 04:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
seeing none I asked the clerk to call
 
04:14:08.570 --> 04:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
the role on the question of retain for
 
04:14:11.330 --> 04:14:11.340 align:start position:0%

Bill 176 is retained in committee
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
and will not be dealt with again until
 
04:15:08.330 --> 04:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
this fall after September
 
04:15:10.490 --> 04:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll close the public
 
04:15:13.870 --> 04:15:13.880 align:start position:0%

exact session rather
 
04:15:19.150 --> 04:15:19.160 align:start position:0%

action plan
 
04:15:35.389 --> 04:15:35.399 align:start position:0%

04:15:46.250 --> 04:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:49.010 --> 04:15:49.020 align:start position:0%

04:15:52.130 --> 04:15:52.140 align:start position:0%

representatives serving in Rockingham
 
05:32:00.948 --> 05:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
County District 29. our colleague
 
05:32:02.930 --> 05:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative Kat McGee asked that I
 
05:32:06.770 --> 05:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 524 and read the following
 
05:32:08.810 --> 05:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
testimony from her
 
05:32:10.730 --> 05:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
chairman Voss and his team colleagues at
 
05:32:12.350 --> 05:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
the house senate technology and energy
 
05:32:15.170 --> 05:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
committee I'm sorry that I am unable to
 
05:32:16.850 --> 05:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
be with you today but I am pleased to
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
present HB 524 for your consideration
 
05:32:23.570 --> 05:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
as long as I have been on stne there has
 
05:32:25.128 --> 05:32:25.138 align:start position:0%
been division around the proper use of
 
05:32:26.868 --> 05:32:26.878 align:start position:0%
Reggie funding in the state of New
 
05:32:26.878 --> 05:32:27.708 align:start position:0%
Reggie funding in the state of New
Hampshire

05:32:27.708 --> 05:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:32:29.448 --> 05:32:29.458 align:start position:0%
I believe we are missing an opportunity
 
05:32:31.550 --> 05:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
to lower our overall demand and prevent
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
the sunk costs that come from
 
05:32:35.690 --> 05:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
large-scale dirty fuel infrastructure
 
05:32:38.868 --> 05:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
when we Fritter away the value our state
 
05:32:40.850 --> 05:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
derives from being part of the regional
 
05:32:43.430 --> 05:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative
 
05:32:45.650 --> 05:32:45.660 align:start position:0%
in recent hearings I asked Des to
 
05:32:47.930 --> 05:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
confirm what I had read about other
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
participating States using on average 80
 
05:32:53.750 --> 05:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
percent of their Reggie auction proceeds
 
05:32:55.610 --> 05:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
for investments into lowering their
 
05:32:57.948 --> 05:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
imported fuel dependence
 
05:33:00.470 --> 05:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
we have continued to debate whether all
 
05:33:02.930 --> 05:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
the money should be distributed as a
 
05:33:05.270 --> 05:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
bill credit when in fact the economies
 
05:33:08.208 --> 05:33:08.218 align:start position:0%
of scale that are intended By Reggie are
 
05:33:10.490 --> 05:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
the biggest savings we could Supply to
 
05:33:12.110 --> 05:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
all rate payers
 
05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
we currently invest less than a tenth of
 
05:33:17.390 --> 05:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
what our regional our regional Reggie
 
05:33:19.368 --> 05:33:19.378 align:start position:0%
Partners invest
 
05:33:21.410 --> 05:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
I was surprised to learn that before the
 
05:33:23.448 --> 05:33:23.458 align:start position:0%
quarterly auction proceeds were changed
 
05:33:25.610 --> 05:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
in statute to provide all but one dollar
 
05:33:27.230 --> 05:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
to Bill credits
 
05:33:29.510 --> 05:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature had agreed to invest the
 
05:33:32.270 --> 05:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
first six dollars of the proceeds
 
05:33:35.330 --> 05:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
so in the instance of a 13 dollar
 
05:33:37.788 --> 05:33:37.798 align:start position:0%
auction credit six dollars would go to
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
bring overall demand down thereby truly
 
05:33:44.448 --> 05:33:44.458 align:start position:0%
lowering energy costs for everyone and
 
05:33:46.368 --> 05:33:46.378 align:start position:0%
allowing the state to manage programs
 
05:33:48.770 --> 05:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
with sufficient funding to gain real
 
05:33:48.780 --> 05:33:50.390 align:start position:0%
with sufficient funding to gain real
savings

05:33:50.390 --> 05:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
savings
 
05:33:52.070 --> 05:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
and the remaining seven dollars would
 
05:33:54.170 --> 05:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
continue to be reimbursed as consumer
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
bill rebates
 
05:33:58.010 --> 05:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
but knowing how our committee feels
 
05:33:59.810 --> 05:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
about this funding I am proposing that
 
05:34:01.910 --> 05:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
we only reinstate half of that six
 
05:34:04.850 --> 05:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
dollars in a compromise that says we can
 
05:34:06.650 --> 05:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
do a lot of good and declare it a
 
05:34:09.230 --> 05:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
victory by passing a bill that requires
 
05:34:11.390 --> 05:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
the first three dollars go into the doe
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency accounts to allow us
 
05:34:16.730 --> 05:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
to advance in meaningful ways
 
05:34:19.910 --> 05:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
HB 524 says that we can do several good
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
things without sacrificing the concept
 
05:34:24.948 --> 05:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
of direct help to electric bills we can
 
05:34:27.288 --> 05:34:27.298 align:start position:0%
triple the doe funding to Energy
 
05:34:29.390 --> 05:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and renewable and sustainable
 
05:34:31.788 --> 05:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
energy projects by contributing the
 
05:34:33.910 --> 05:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
first three dollars of the current 13
 
05:34:37.128 --> 05:34:37.138 align:start position:0%
Reggie allowance leaving ten dollars per
 
05:34:38.770 --> 05:34:38.780 align:start position:0%
allowance to continue to help with
 
05:34:40.910 --> 05:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
consumer bills
 
05:34:42.770 --> 05:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
because of the rate of growth of the
 
05:34:44.628 --> 05:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
auction allowances we are still
 
05:34:46.190 --> 05:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
contributing a significant amount of
 
05:34:49.070 --> 05:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
money to all consumer electric bills
 
05:34:51.410 --> 05:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
however when we originally agreed to one
 
05:34:52.788 --> 05:34:52.798 align:start position:0%
dollar per allowance to help lower
 
05:34:54.590 --> 05:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
demand that was 50 percent of the
 
05:34:58.070 --> 05:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
allowance our current investment is 7.7
 
05:34:58.080 --> 05:34:59.090 align:start position:0%
allowance our current investment is 7.7
percent

05:34:59.090 --> 05:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:35:03.410 --> 05:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
one dollar out of 13 and 92.3 percent of
 
05:35:06.170 --> 05:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
the funding disappears onto bills this
 
05:35:07.970 --> 05:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
is wasteful
 
05:35:10.970 --> 05:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
HB 524 asks that we increase our
 
05:35:13.310 --> 05:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
investment to three dollars per auction
 
05:35:16.010 --> 05:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
share and settle on an investment ratio
 
05:35:17.570 --> 05:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
of 23 percent
 
05:35:20.208 --> 05:35:20.218 align:start position:0%
returning 77 percent by putting ten
 
05:35:22.190 --> 05:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
dollars per auctions share into the
 
05:35:26.330 --> 05:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
pockets of rate payers it's a way to
 
05:35:27.650 --> 05:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
gain the true value of the program
 
05:35:30.788 --> 05:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
without sacrificing the help to build
 
05:35:33.948 --> 05:35:33.958 align:start position:0%
to Bill payers in this tough time
 
05:35:35.930 --> 05:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
if auction prices continue to increase
 
05:35:37.670 --> 05:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
then the amount of help to offset
 
05:35:40.970 --> 05:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
efforts also increases consumers lose
 
05:35:43.190 --> 05:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
nothing but the state gains the ability
 
05:35:46.250 --> 05:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
to do more to help lower costs
 
05:35:48.288 --> 05:35:48.298 align:start position:0%
without some investment in changing the
 
05:35:49.850 --> 05:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
energy picture in New Hampshire we will
 
05:35:51.948 --> 05:35:51.958 align:start position:0%
be doomed to repeat last Fall's rate
 
05:35:54.410 --> 05:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
hikes it is time we made this program
 
05:35:56.448 --> 05:35:56.458 align:start position:0%
work for the people of New Hampshire
 
05:35:58.250 --> 05:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
so we have something to show for our
 
05:35:59.930 --> 05:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
years of participation
 
05:36:02.448 --> 05:36:02.458 align:start position:0%
I ask for your support on of this
 
05:36:04.970 --> 05:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
conservative Bill to gain a win for the
 
05:36:07.310 --> 05:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire thanks for your
 
05:36:07.320 --> 05:36:08.690 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire thanks for your
time

05:36:08.690 --> 05:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:36:10.670 --> 05:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
that concludes the testimony that
 
05:36:12.530 --> 05:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGee asks that I share
 
05:36:13.788 --> 05:36:13.798 align:start position:0%
with you
 
05:36:15.708 --> 05:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
I am happy to try to answer any
 
05:36:20.090 --> 05:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:22.670 --> 05:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative munz Mr
 
05:36:24.288 --> 05:36:24.298 align:start position:0%
chairman before we proceed we've got it
 
05:36:26.868 --> 05:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
I got a note from representative McGee
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
actually she says that the stream the
 
05:36:31.310 --> 05:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
live stream of our committee is not it's
 
05:36:34.128 --> 05:36:34.138 align:start position:0%
not working it's not on serious
 
05:36:34.138 --> 05:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
not working it's not on serious
second

05:36:35.510 --> 05:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:44.270 --> 05:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
okay Christy our committee researcher
 
05:36:46.430 --> 05:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
assures us that the live stream is
 
05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
working so if you hear differently from
 
05:36:51.770 --> 05:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
representative McGee let us know
 
05:36:53.570 --> 05:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
it might be something on her her end
 
05:36:55.310 --> 05:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
rather than oh no
 
05:36:56.690 --> 05:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
our end
 
05:36:59.270 --> 05:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
so back to where we were representative
 
05:37:01.610 --> 05:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
muns thank you for introducing the bill
 
05:37:04.128 --> 05:37:04.138 align:start position:0%
you told me earlier not to ask questions
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh are you sure you still want to take
 
05:37:07.200 --> 05:37:09.350 align:start position:0%
uh are you sure you still want to take
questions

05:37:09.350 --> 05:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:37:11.868 --> 05:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
I stand by my comment that I will try to
 
05:37:14.570 --> 05:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
answer questions okay questions for
 
05:37:19.550 --> 05:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:21.170 --> 05:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
seeing none looks like you're off the
 
05:37:21.180 --> 05:37:22.368 align:start position:0%
seeing none looks like you're off the
hook

05:37:22.368 --> 05:37:22.378 align:start position:0%
hook
 
05:37:26.868 --> 05:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:28.730 --> 05:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
we take care of our own
 
05:37:31.788 --> 05:37:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:33.230 --> 05:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:37:36.110 --> 05:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
Let's uh let's bring forward now
 
05:37:38.570 --> 05:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
Josh Elliott from the Department of
 
05:37:41.330 --> 05:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
energy to give us his perspective on
 
05:37:46.490 --> 05:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:46.500 --> 05:37:47.770 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:37:47.770 --> 05:37:47.780 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:37:50.570 --> 05:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh members of the committee
 
05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
for the record Josh Elliott director of
 
05:37:53.810 --> 05:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
the division of policy and programs the
 
05:37:55.730 --> 05:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy the
 
05:37:58.128 --> 05:37:58.138 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on this bill
 
05:38:00.050 --> 05:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
um I think representative munz through
 
05:38:02.030 --> 05:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative McGee's testimonies
 
05:38:03.770 --> 05:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
are laid out exactly what the intended
 
05:38:06.170 --> 05:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
impact of this bill is and the sort of
 
05:38:07.850 --> 05:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
intended goals
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
um the only thing the department would
 
05:38:10.850 --> 05:38:10.860 align:start position:0%
add um just refer you to the fiscal note
 
05:38:14.030 --> 05:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
which was done jointly by Des and doe
 
05:38:16.010 --> 05:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
and I mean by jointly I mean Des did
 
05:38:17.510 --> 05:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
much of the heavy lifting on this one
 
05:38:19.310 --> 05:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
for our review
 
05:38:21.590 --> 05:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
um the the cumulative rate impact just
 
05:38:23.090 --> 05:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
purely the rate impact would be about
 
05:38:26.030 --> 05:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
6.4 million dollars obviously that would
 
05:38:28.010 --> 05:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
be then offset by any of the benefits
 
05:38:29.628 --> 05:38:29.638 align:start position:0%
that we accrued to the folks who would
 
05:38:29.638 --> 05:38:31.190 align:start position:0%
that we accrued to the folks who would
receive

05:38:31.190 --> 05:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
receive
 
05:38:31.200 --> 05:38:31.850 align:start position:0%
receive
um

05:38:31.850 --> 05:38:31.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:35.270 --> 05:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency uh projects done that
 
05:38:37.070 --> 05:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
are funded through these through this
 
05:38:39.288 --> 05:38:39.298 align:start position:0%
through these funds so with that I'm
 
05:38:40.490 --> 05:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions the
 
05:38:42.288 --> 05:38:42.298 align:start position:0%
committee has
 
05:38:44.390 --> 05:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for Mr
 
05:38:46.490 --> 05:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
Elliott representative Nate Reynolds has
 
05:38:47.810 --> 05:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:38:49.550 --> 05:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:38:49.560 --> 05:38:50.510 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

05:38:50.510 --> 05:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:54.050 --> 05:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
Mr Elliott with with the relatively low
 
05:38:57.530 --> 05:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
amount of funding that currently goes
 
05:39:00.110 --> 05:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
into the Energy Efficiency fund
 
05:39:02.270 --> 05:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
the way things are now
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's just a dollar from each allowance
 
05:39:08.750 --> 05:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
auction can you shed any light on the
 
05:39:08.760 --> 05:39:10.910 align:start position:0%
auction can you shed any light on the
um

05:39:10.910 --> 05:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:13.368 --> 05:39:13.378 align:start position:0%
stability of of
 
05:39:17.050 --> 05:39:17.060 align:start position:0%
funding and how often
 
05:39:19.910 --> 05:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
folks who contact the New Hampshire
 
05:39:22.368 --> 05:39:22.378 align:start position:0%
saves program
 
05:39:26.150 --> 05:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
to seeking seeking funding for Energy
 
05:39:27.770 --> 05:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
Efficiency measures in their home or
 
05:39:29.628 --> 05:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
business how often
 
05:39:31.310 --> 05:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
are they told
 
05:39:34.250 --> 05:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
you know we're out of funds
 
05:39:35.690 --> 05:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
um wait you know we'll take your
 
05:39:38.330 --> 05:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
application but uh we gotta wait for the
 
05:39:40.970 --> 05:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
fund to be refilled
 
05:39:42.350 --> 05:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for the question
 
05:39:44.090 --> 05:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you very much for the
 
05:39:44.100 --> 05:39:45.110 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you very much for the
question

05:39:45.110 --> 05:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:39:45.120 --> 05:39:45.708 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:39:45.708 --> 05:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:48.170 --> 05:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
as you know with um House Bill 549 from
 
05:39:49.430 --> 05:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
last session
 
05:39:51.170 --> 05:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
um with the uh
 
05:39:53.270 --> 05:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
puc order prior to that there was
 
05:39:56.030 --> 05:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of uh instability in the
 
05:39:57.530 --> 05:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire saves programs just
 
05:39:57.540 --> 05:39:59.030 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire saves programs just
generally

05:39:59.030 --> 05:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
generally
 
05:39:59.040 --> 05:39:59.628 align:start position:0%
generally
um

05:39:59.628 --> 05:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:02.270 --> 05:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
I believe a lot of the uh sort of
 
05:40:03.830 --> 05:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
uncertainty has been worked out of the
 
05:40:04.970 --> 05:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
system from that I think they've been
 
05:40:06.350 --> 05:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with the backlogs they've gotten
 
05:40:08.690 --> 05:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
their programs set up a lot of that has
 
05:40:10.788 --> 05:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
sort of worked its way through there are
 
05:40:12.890 --> 05:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
a couple of other different uh buckets
 
05:40:16.010 --> 05:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
of funding that folks who are looking to
 
05:40:17.990 --> 05:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
get assistance will go to whether it's
 
05:40:20.330 --> 05:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
directly from the systems benefits
 
05:40:22.970 --> 05:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
charge through the uh hea funds which is
 
05:40:25.128 --> 05:40:25.138 align:start position:0%
low income funds the department also
 
05:40:26.628 --> 05:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
runs the weatherization assistance
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
program we also have additional funding
 
05:40:30.050 --> 05:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
from the bipartisan infrastructure law
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
for additional funds
 
05:40:31.920 --> 05:40:32.570 align:start position:0%
for additional funds
um

05:40:32.570 --> 05:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:34.310 --> 05:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
so just to get you give you a sense of
 
05:40:36.350 --> 05:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
sort of the larger funding picture out
 
05:40:36.360 --> 05:40:37.490 align:start position:0%
sort of the larger funding picture out
there

05:40:37.490 --> 05:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:40:40.490 --> 05:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the waitlist by specific
 
05:40:42.470 --> 05:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
utility territory if they exist and how
 
05:40:44.330 --> 05:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
long they take to get off a wait list if
 
05:40:45.708 --> 05:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
one does exist
 
05:40:46.970 --> 05:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
um I think would be better directed to
 
05:40:49.190 --> 05:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
the utilities rather than than us so
 
05:40:51.170 --> 05:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
sorry that's a long story not answer
 
05:40:51.180 --> 05:40:54.770 align:start position:0%
sorry that's a long story not answer
answer

05:40:54.770 --> 05:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:01.310 --> 05:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:03.288 --> 05:41:03.298 align:start position:0%
saying none I want to thank you for
 
05:41:04.850 --> 05:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
being here
 
05:41:07.850 --> 05:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
to give us your perspective on this Bill
 
05:41:10.190 --> 05:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman
 
05:41:12.650 --> 05:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
and we'll Now call forward Mr Joe
 
05:41:14.830 --> 05:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
Fontaine from the Department of energy
 
05:41:18.650 --> 05:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
to give us his perspective
 
05:41:25.670 --> 05:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:27.410 --> 05:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:41:27.420 --> 05:41:28.670 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
committee

05:41:28.670 --> 05:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:41:31.490 --> 05:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Joe Fontaine I
 
05:41:33.050 --> 05:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
represent um
 
05:41:36.530 --> 05:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services Des
 
05:41:40.970 --> 05:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh Des takes no position on the bill but
 
05:41:43.128 --> 05:41:43.138 align:start position:0%
I did um
 
05:41:46.430 --> 05:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
circulate just prior to the hearing a
 
05:41:48.830 --> 05:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
chart that I think is
 
05:41:48.840 --> 05:41:50.270 align:start position:0%
chart that I think is
handy

05:41:50.270 --> 05:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
handy
 
05:41:53.270 --> 05:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
um first page goes over
 
05:41:53.280 --> 05:41:54.830 align:start position:0%
um first page goes over
um

05:41:54.830 --> 05:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:57.410 --> 05:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
allocation of the revenue under current
 
05:41:57.420 --> 05:41:59.410 align:start position:0%
allocation of the revenue under current
law

05:41:59.410 --> 05:41:59.420 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:42:04.368 --> 05:42:04.378 align:start position:0%
and if you assume that 43 million goes
 
05:42:09.770 --> 05:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
into the fund as was the case last year
 
05:42:14.470 --> 05:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
um and 3.21 million allowances
 
05:42:17.150 --> 05:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
are allocated
 
05:42:22.128 --> 05:42:22.138 align:start position:0%
then uh that's what goes to uh 3.21
 
05:42:23.570 --> 05:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
million would go to the Energy
 
05:42:25.490 --> 05:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs
 
05:42:30.110 --> 05:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
so that and the remainder of 39 plus
 
05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
million would go to Great payer rebates
 
05:42:36.830 --> 05:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's under current law
 
05:42:39.890 --> 05:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:42.890 --> 05:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned verbally
 
05:42:45.470 --> 05:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
by representative munz
 
05:42:47.150 --> 05:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
um three times
 
05:42:49.128 --> 05:42:49.138 align:start position:0%
the current amount would go to Energy
 
05:42:52.030 --> 05:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs or
 
05:42:54.410 --> 05:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
9.63 million
 
05:42:56.448 --> 05:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
which is which matches the amount that's
 
05:42:58.970 --> 05:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note that's attached to
 
05:43:00.050 --> 05:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:43:02.750 --> 05:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
and the amount of rebates would be
 
05:43:06.948 --> 05:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
reduced to 33 million
 
05:43:06.958 --> 05:43:07.910 align:start position:0%
reduced to 33 million
um

05:43:07.910 --> 05:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:10.610 --> 05:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
when I handed this out I got the
 
05:43:12.550 --> 05:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
comments that you've seen this before
 
05:43:15.708 --> 05:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
you did see this a similar chart for
 
05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 418
 
05:43:22.150 --> 05:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
um and under that bill if you remember
 
05:43:27.230 --> 05:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
that did away with the rebates and
 
05:43:30.770 --> 05:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
um all of the revenue went to Energy
 
05:43:30.780 --> 05:43:32.448 align:start position:0%
um all of the revenue went to Energy
Efficiency

05:43:32.448 --> 05:43:32.458 align:start position:0%
Efficiency
 
05:43:36.948 --> 05:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
so this bill is is uh
 
05:43:38.810 --> 05:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
increases the amount to Energy
 
05:43:38.820 --> 05:43:40.990 align:start position:0%
increases the amount to Energy
Efficiency

05:43:40.990 --> 05:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
Efficiency
 
05:43:44.868 --> 05:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
and and lowers the amount of rebates as
 
05:43:48.410 --> 05:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
compared to current law but it is not as
 
05:43:52.850 --> 05:43:52.860 align:start position:0%
ambitious as house bill 418.
 
05:43:56.510 --> 05:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's all I I have take questions thank
 
05:43:59.330 --> 05:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
you very much appreciate your testimony
 
05:44:02.448 --> 05:44:02.458 align:start position:0%
did you participate in the creation of
 
05:44:06.350 --> 05:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
the table that's on the back page of the
 
05:44:07.970 --> 05:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
05:44:11.570 --> 05:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
yes we completed a fiscal note worksheet
 
05:44:13.368 --> 05:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
jointly with Department of energy as
 
05:44:16.190 --> 05:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
Josh said and um
 
05:44:18.470 --> 05:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
you as you know
 
05:44:21.048 --> 05:44:21.058 align:start position:0%
um legislative budget assistant actually
 
05:44:22.810 --> 05:44:22.820 align:start position:0%
does the
 
05:44:25.730 --> 05:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
write-up of the fiscal note but it's
 
05:44:27.830 --> 05:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
basically yes that's what we sent to
 
05:44:30.650 --> 05:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
them so in your judgment is this table
 
05:44:30.660 --> 05:44:33.170 align:start position:0%
them so in your judgment is this table
correct

05:44:33.170 --> 05:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:44:36.110 --> 05:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
yes yes oh okay great did you find the
 
05:44:38.090 --> 05:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
description it's accurate from what was
 
05:44:41.150 --> 05:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
in the chart okay thank you for other
 
05:44:44.510 --> 05:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Fontaine uh Tony Kaplan
 
05:44:46.730 --> 05:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan thank you Mr chair
 
05:44:49.910 --> 05:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Fontaine for coming uh
 
05:44:49.920 --> 05:44:50.930 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Fontaine for coming uh
today

05:44:50.930 --> 05:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:44:53.810 --> 05:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
um do you have any idea of the impact of
 
05:44:55.970 --> 05:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
an increase in Energy Efficiency funds
 
05:44:57.830 --> 05:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
on air quality does your department make
 
05:44:59.570 --> 05:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
any estimation of that
 
05:44:59.580 --> 05:45:02.948 align:start position:0%
any estimation of that
uh

05:45:02.948 --> 05:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:05.570 --> 05:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
Reggie is uh
 
05:45:10.610 --> 05:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:13.930 --> 05:45:13.940 align:start position:0%
IT addresses climate change
 
05:45:16.850 --> 05:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
secondary benefits are that if you
 
05:45:19.368 --> 05:45:19.378 align:start position:0%
reduce carbon dioxide you also reduce
 
05:45:19.378 --> 05:45:21.708 align:start position:0%
reduce carbon dioxide you also reduce
co-pollutants

05:45:21.708 --> 05:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
co-pollutants
 
05:45:24.770 --> 05:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
that would have an impact on
 
05:45:24.780 --> 05:45:26.770 align:start position:0%
that would have an impact on
health

05:45:26.770 --> 05:45:26.780 align:start position:0%
health
 
05:45:30.470 --> 05:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
there have been reports in the past
 
05:45:34.490 --> 05:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
as to how much benefit there has been
 
05:45:39.890 --> 05:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:41.930 --> 05:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
oh the Name Escapes Me Now of the
 
05:45:43.910 --> 05:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
organization that did it
 
05:45:46.128 --> 05:45:46.138 align:start position:0%
uh but um
 
05:45:50.090 --> 05:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
quite large estimates of uh impact on on
 
05:45:50.100 --> 05:45:52.070 align:start position:0%
quite large estimates of uh impact on on
health

05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
health
 
05:45:54.830 --> 05:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah thank you Mr chair is
 
05:45:56.750 --> 05:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
there any way you could provide that to
 
05:45:58.430 --> 05:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
the committee at some point that'd be
 
05:46:01.610 --> 05:46:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:03.890 --> 05:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
05:46:06.110 --> 05:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
Reynolds has a question thank you Mr
 
05:46:08.810 --> 05:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I'm along the same lines the
 
05:46:11.570 --> 05:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
regional grid operator showed us a graph
 
05:46:11.580 --> 05:46:13.090 align:start position:0%
regional grid operator showed us a graph
that

05:46:13.090 --> 05:46:13.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:46:15.830 --> 05:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
showed that behind both behind the
 
05:46:19.930 --> 05:46:19.940 align:start position:0%
meters solar and Energy Efficiency had
 
05:46:22.310 --> 05:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
significantly depressed
 
05:46:24.470 --> 05:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
total Regional demand
 
05:46:26.930 --> 05:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
05:46:29.030 --> 05:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
has had a
 
05:46:31.850 --> 05:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
beneficial Financial effect on lowering
 
05:46:35.330 --> 05:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
lowering prices on on the grid and
 
05:46:38.090 --> 05:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
saving consumers money so
 
05:46:38.100 --> 05:46:39.410 align:start position:0%
saving consumers money so
um

05:46:39.410 --> 05:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:40.910 --> 05:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know rather than I don't want to
 
05:46:43.070 --> 05:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
ask you to do the economic analysis on
 
05:46:44.330 --> 05:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
that but
 
05:46:47.208 --> 05:46:47.218 align:start position:0%
with increased investment in Energy
 
05:46:50.930 --> 05:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
Efficiency as this bill contemplates be
 
05:46:53.628 --> 05:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
expected to produce
 
05:46:56.448 --> 05:46:56.458 align:start position:0%
savings for all customers in New
 
05:46:56.458 --> 05:46:57.350 align:start position:0%
savings for all customers in New
Hampshire

05:46:57.350 --> 05:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:47:01.250 --> 05:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
through reduction of regional demand
 
05:47:05.090 --> 05:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
yeah in in past sessions we've testified
 
05:47:05.100 --> 05:47:06.590 align:start position:0%
yeah in in past sessions we've testified
regarding

05:47:06.590 --> 05:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
05:47:09.170 --> 05:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
the transmission costs associated with
 
05:47:10.448 --> 05:47:10.458 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:47:13.610 --> 05:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
with the electricity bill
 
05:47:16.850 --> 05:47:16.860 align:start position:0%
the house bill and
 
05:47:22.070 --> 05:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
um so transmission costs uh
 
05:47:25.310 --> 05:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
each state in New England shares in
 
05:47:27.410 --> 05:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
those costs proportional
 
05:47:32.208 --> 05:47:32.218 align:start position:0%
to their load and um
 
05:47:35.090 --> 05:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
so if the other states
 
05:47:37.850 --> 05:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
are reducing load because they're
 
05:47:40.788 --> 05:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
investing in Energy Efficiency and their
 
05:47:42.770 --> 05:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
load is going down as shown on that
 
05:47:42.780 --> 05:47:44.230 align:start position:0%
load is going down as shown on that
chart

05:47:44.230 --> 05:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
chart
 
05:47:47.690 --> 05:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
and actually if you look at
 
05:47:51.350 --> 05:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
individual State charts for that and
 
05:47:51.360 --> 05:47:52.270 align:start position:0%
individual State charts for that and
compare

05:47:52.270 --> 05:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
compare
 
05:47:55.548 --> 05:47:55.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's I'm not sure the most
 
05:47:57.708 --> 05:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
recent but in the past it's been almost
 
05:47:57.718 --> 05:47:58.788 align:start position:0%
recent but in the past it's been almost
flat

05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
flat
 
05:48:02.208 --> 05:48:02.218 align:start position:0%
rather than that difference so
 
05:48:02.218 --> 05:48:03.410 align:start position:0%
rather than that difference so
um

05:48:03.410 --> 05:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:05.810 --> 05:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
because we don't invest as much in
 
05:48:07.490 --> 05:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency
 
05:48:07.500 --> 05:48:08.868 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency
so

05:48:08.868 --> 05:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:48:08.878 --> 05:48:09.890 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:48:09.890 --> 05:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:12.350 --> 05:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
further investment in transmission costs
 
05:48:14.208 --> 05:48:14.218 align:start position:0%
for the region
 
05:48:17.750 --> 05:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
if our proportion goes up slightly
 
05:48:20.510 --> 05:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the states go down then
 
05:48:26.690 --> 05:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:32.030 --> 05:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:33.650 --> 05:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you Mr
 
05:48:35.750 --> 05:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
Fontaine for giving us your perspective
 
05:48:38.510 --> 05:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
and for giving us an updated chart on
 
05:48:41.570 --> 05:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
the Reggie Revenue allocation
 
05:48:44.208 --> 05:48:44.218 align:start position:0%
I have no other pink cards for this
 
05:48:46.368 --> 05:48:46.378 align:start position:0%
public hearing is there anyone else who
 
05:48:48.350 --> 05:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
would like to speak with the honorable
 
05:48:50.930 --> 05:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
John Mann like to come up and address
 
05:48:55.250 --> 05:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:56.930 --> 05:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
good to see you John thanks for making
 
05:49:00.530 --> 05:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:03.288 --> 05:49:03.298 align:start position:0%
microphone on
 
05:49:05.510 --> 05:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's worth it thank you very much for
 
05:49:08.750 --> 05:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
being willing to listen I am I think I
 
05:49:11.270 --> 05:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
want to pass out a
 
05:49:14.030 --> 05:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
homemade flyer
 
05:49:29.750 --> 05:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:31.730 --> 05:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
I'll start with that I'll start with
 
05:49:35.390 --> 05:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
that chart I was just deciding that I
 
05:49:37.128 --> 05:49:37.138 align:start position:0%
would um
 
05:49:41.570 --> 05:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:44.330 --> 05:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
the value of Energy Efficiency in
 
05:49:44.340 --> 05:49:46.788 align:start position:0%
the value of Energy Efficiency in
returning

05:49:46.788 --> 05:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
returning
 
05:49:49.010 --> 05:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
um wealth to the community
 
05:49:51.410 --> 05:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
in other words you know on a family
 
05:49:54.948 --> 05:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
basis of course if you have a more NHA
 
05:49:57.708 --> 05:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
efficient house it's not your your
 
05:49:59.448 --> 05:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
heating bills and your electric bills
 
05:50:02.690 --> 05:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
which are part of that will go down so
 
05:50:05.690 --> 05:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh I happen to have too much experience
 
05:50:07.548 --> 05:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
with a very nice house
 
05:50:07.558 --> 05:50:08.208 align:start position:0%
with a very nice house
um

05:50:08.208 --> 05:50:08.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
it was 37 below the other day and in at
 
05:50:14.570 --> 05:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
7 A.M on Sunday and it was 67 in the
 
05:50:14.580 --> 05:50:15.350 align:start position:0%
7 A.M on Sunday and it was 67 in the
house

05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:50:18.350 --> 05:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
that's 104 degree difference it's the
 
05:50:20.690 --> 05:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
insulation in the house that made that
 
05:50:20.700 --> 05:50:21.770 align:start position:0%
insulation in the house that made that
difference

05:50:21.770 --> 05:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:50:24.170 --> 05:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
we heat with a heat pump which is kind
 
05:50:25.670 --> 05:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
of slow and it kind of was kind of
 
05:50:28.430 --> 05:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
oozing a little bit wisp of heat in the
 
05:50:31.850 --> 05:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
floor so that's overnight Heat
 
05:50:35.570 --> 05:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:35.580 --> 05:50:36.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:50:36.410 --> 05:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:39.470 --> 05:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
our town library we had a woman named
 
05:50:42.288 --> 05:50:42.298 align:start position:0%
Margaret Dillon who was an expert
 
05:50:45.890 --> 05:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
auditor she has infrared equipment and
 
05:50:48.530 --> 05:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
she would put a blower door and suck air
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
out of the library on a particular door
 
05:50:53.270 --> 05:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
and you can go around and see where all
 
05:50:55.788 --> 05:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
the cold air is coming in in there with
 
05:50:57.650 --> 05:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
an infrared camera
 
05:51:01.810 --> 05:51:01.820 align:start position:0%
combined with a typical
 
05:51:04.128 --> 05:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
two-picture camera you know exactly
 
05:51:05.510 --> 05:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
where the air is coming and you don't
 
05:51:07.010 --> 05:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
know what to do
 
05:51:11.270 --> 05:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
and we cut the cost by about 58 percent
 
05:51:13.368 --> 05:51:13.378 align:start position:0%
and we did that with some pretty radical
 
05:51:13.378 --> 05:51:14.628 align:start position:0%
and we did that with some pretty radical
work

05:51:14.628 --> 05:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:51:17.448 --> 05:51:17.458 align:start position:0%
but even before that just by sealing two
 
05:51:20.150 --> 05:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
hatches where air could go from the main
 
05:51:22.970 --> 05:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
floor up to the first attic and up to
 
05:51:25.310 --> 05:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
the upper attic which is fully open to
 
05:51:26.750 --> 05:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
the outside
 
05:51:29.330 --> 05:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
we could cut we cut the heat by 20
 
05:51:29.340 --> 05:51:30.470 align:start position:0%
we could cut we cut the heat by 20
percent

05:51:30.470 --> 05:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:51:34.070 --> 05:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
and just that work alone got the town
 
05:51:34.080 --> 05:51:35.270 align:start position:0%
and just that work alone got the town
voted

05:51:35.270 --> 05:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
voted
 
05:51:37.490 --> 05:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollars to complete the
 
05:51:38.570 --> 05:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
rest of the
 
05:51:41.030 --> 05:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
project so that's pretty effective
 
05:51:45.350 --> 05:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
what I've passed out is my study work I
 
05:51:48.830 --> 05:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
just decided to look into the issue of
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
um return on investment if you return if
 
05:51:53.570 --> 05:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
you um
 
05:51:56.810 --> 05:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
if you insulate a bunch of houses one
 
05:51:58.548 --> 05:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
after another or a bunch of buildings or
 
05:52:00.048 --> 05:52:00.058 align:start position:0%
you do an increased amount of energy
 
05:52:00.058 --> 05:52:01.368 align:start position:0%
you do an increased amount of energy
efficiency

05:52:01.368 --> 05:52:01.378 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
05:52:04.070 --> 05:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
what happens is the results of that work
 
05:52:06.110 --> 05:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
are permanent it's not like lighting a
 
05:52:07.788 --> 05:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
furnace and burning oil you're just
 
05:52:10.128 --> 05:52:10.138 align:start position:0%
making an absolutely permanent change to
 
05:52:12.650 --> 05:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
the building and reducing its rate of
 
05:52:15.048 --> 05:52:15.058 align:start position:0%
Need for energy
 
05:52:18.590 --> 05:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
and every time so from then on for the
 
05:52:20.208 --> 05:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
remainder of the duration of that
 
05:52:22.730 --> 05:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
building it is saving that much
 
05:52:25.430 --> 05:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
money and that much fuel every year
 
05:52:27.890 --> 05:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
then you do your second Year's work in
 
05:52:30.590 --> 05:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
an Energy Efficiency program Statewide
 
05:52:32.990 --> 05:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
and there's another stream
 
05:52:36.410 --> 05:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
of savings and then another and another
 
05:52:38.750 --> 05:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
and if you graph that what you get is a
 
05:52:41.150 --> 05:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
parabolic increase or an accelerating
 
05:52:43.430 --> 05:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
increase in the amount of money saved
 
05:52:46.730 --> 05:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
for a linear amount of investment that
 
05:52:49.070 --> 05:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
means there's a break-even point
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
and that explains finally why some of
 
05:52:53.750 --> 05:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
these other states have been so
 
05:52:53.760 --> 05:52:55.448 align:start position:0%
these other states have been so
successful

05:52:55.448 --> 05:52:55.458 align:start position:0%
successful
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know I mean
 
05:53:00.048 --> 05:53:00.058 align:start position:0%
poor Boston they have Harvard Business
 
05:53:02.628 --> 05:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
School and all these other places right
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
next door breathing down their neck so
 
05:53:08.510 --> 05:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
of course they understood all these
 
05:53:10.310 --> 05:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
potentials they had all kinds of models
 
05:53:13.190 --> 05:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
to look at and so on
 
05:53:15.170 --> 05:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's I think it's
 
05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
something that we should realize that
 
05:53:19.310 --> 05:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
there will be a break-even point that
 
05:53:21.650 --> 05:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
competent management and competently
 
05:53:23.930 --> 05:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
getting through the learning curve
 
05:53:25.910 --> 05:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
will get us to this Breaking Point
 
05:53:25.920 --> 05:53:28.788 align:start position:0%
will get us to this Breaking Point
earlier

05:53:28.788 --> 05:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:30.470 --> 05:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh than it would have we just
 
05:53:32.270 --> 05:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
lackadaisically throw some money at
 
05:53:34.070 --> 05:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency
 
05:53:38.330 --> 05:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:41.510 --> 05:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
is money going into the economy
 
05:53:44.448 --> 05:53:44.458 align:start position:0%
sufficient to pay for the remainder of
 
05:53:45.590 --> 05:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
the program
 
05:53:48.590 --> 05:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what my chart seems to say it
 
05:53:50.090 --> 05:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
says that to me
 
05:53:52.670 --> 05:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
so it's like a no-brainer to go Whole
 
05:53:55.310 --> 05:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
Hog on Energy Efficiency so that's the
 
05:53:58.490 --> 05:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
main point I wanted to make I think that
 
05:54:01.850 --> 05:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
is an interest of brevity I'll say make
 
05:54:03.590 --> 05:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of more remarks and I will pass
 
05:54:06.770 --> 05:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
out oh you've seen the chart and I will
 
05:54:08.628 --> 05:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
pass them out back there
 
05:54:08.638 --> 05:54:09.830 align:start position:0%
pass them out back there
um

05:54:09.830 --> 05:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
I think the the point is you know if if
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
you have Energy Efficiency and there are
 
05:54:16.970 --> 05:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
savings that money goes back into the
 
05:54:19.368 --> 05:54:19.378 align:start position:0%
economy and when money is saved in an
 
05:54:21.350 --> 05:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
economy it gets spent Again by somebody
 
05:54:23.090 --> 05:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
else and then somebody else gets the
 
05:54:26.150 --> 05:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
money and so on there's a I think it may
 
05:54:27.170 --> 05:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
be um
 
05:54:29.270 --> 05:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
John Maynard Keynes or something like
 
05:54:31.730 --> 05:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
that theory but basically money that's
 
05:54:33.890 --> 05:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
poured back in gets spent again and the
 
05:54:35.810 --> 05:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
next person spends 80 percent and the
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
next person spends 80 percent so those
 
05:54:40.548 --> 05:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
savings have an impact on the economy on
 
05:54:43.310 --> 05:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
well-being across the state even if it
 
05:54:45.650 --> 05:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't particularly
 
05:54:47.390 --> 05:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
it just has that impact over and over
 
05:54:48.770 --> 05:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
again I don't know how that works
 
05:54:50.030 --> 05:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
personally but
 
05:54:50.040 --> 05:54:51.350 align:start position:0%
personally but
anyhow

05:54:51.350 --> 05:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
anyhow
 
05:54:51.360 --> 05:54:52.670 align:start position:0%
anyhow
um

05:54:52.670 --> 05:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:55.368 --> 05:54:55.378 align:start position:0%
that's there's just so many reasons to
 
05:54:57.890 --> 05:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
go go For Broke on this now I like the
 
05:55:00.230 --> 05:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
idea of this bill as it is
 
05:55:02.570 --> 05:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
because it isn't trying to reach for the
 
05:55:05.448 --> 05:55:05.458 align:start position:0%
sky and so on but you know I'd be the
 
05:55:08.030 --> 05:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
last person to complain if you um
 
05:55:10.430 --> 05:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
just ended it all together I would like
 
05:55:13.730 --> 05:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
to caution that I had such bills to re
 
05:55:16.670 --> 05:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
to end the Reggie rebate
 
05:55:18.948 --> 05:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
um I put in three bills during three of
 
05:55:18.958 --> 05:55:19.788 align:start position:0%
um I put in three bills during three of
my

05:55:19.788 --> 05:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:55:23.090 --> 05:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh terms here and um one of the two of
 
05:55:24.590 --> 05:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
them passed the House and Senate and
 
05:55:26.570 --> 05:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
they were both vetoed by the governor so
 
05:55:29.330 --> 05:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
be we want to be a little careful
 
05:55:32.150 --> 05:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
and I think this bill might make a
 
05:55:35.030 --> 05:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
some good Headway and I really am happy
 
05:55:37.070 --> 05:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
to see it thank you very much
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to answer questions
 
05:55:42.948 --> 05:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable John Mann for coming
 
05:55:45.288 --> 05:55:45.298 align:start position:0%
up here today and giving us this little
 
05:55:48.708 --> 05:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
presentation do we have questions for
 
05:55:50.810 --> 05:55:50.820 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:55:53.330 --> 05:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
question for me
 
05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I I contract with NH the NH saves
 
05:55:59.208 --> 05:55:59.218 align:start position:0%
program on the commercial side
 
05:56:02.270 --> 05:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
and we always we we all know that they
 
05:56:03.770 --> 05:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
and I was hoping somebody from the
 
05:56:06.350 --> 05:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
utilities would be here but I'll ask you
 
05:56:10.250 --> 05:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
um we know that the residential side of
 
05:56:12.708 --> 05:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
the NH saves program always runs out of
 
05:56:15.708 --> 05:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
money always and so we always have to
 
05:56:16.910 --> 05:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
tell people you know if you're going to
 
05:56:19.610 --> 05:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
plan an Energy Efficiency project in
 
05:56:21.410 --> 05:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
your house do it earlier rather than
 
05:56:22.788 --> 05:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
later in the year
 
05:56:25.850 --> 05:56:25.860 align:start position:0%
if we increased the money from one
 
05:56:27.590 --> 05:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
dollar to three dollars do you think it
 
05:56:29.990 --> 05:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
would alleviate that problem
 
05:56:32.390 --> 05:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
I don't have the numbers and I so I
 
05:56:33.708 --> 05:56:33.718 align:start position:0%
couldn't answer it but it certainly
 
05:56:35.270 --> 05:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
seems to me tripling the amount of
 
05:56:38.090 --> 05:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
funding would be a very good idea
 
05:56:40.670 --> 05:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
and you could actually do um more I mean
 
05:56:44.570 --> 05:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:47.690 --> 05:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
you know this it's the idea of doing the
 
05:56:50.030 --> 05:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
um the most egregent fixing the worst
 
05:56:52.070 --> 05:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
problems first and going on to the next
 
05:56:54.470 --> 05:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
and there's the idea of trying to do the
 
05:56:56.948 --> 05:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
most you can in each house get done
 
05:56:59.330 --> 05:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
there's also some education that could
 
05:57:01.190 --> 05:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
be done and that would be inexpensive
 
05:57:02.930 --> 05:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
because people can do a lot on their own
 
05:57:05.570 --> 05:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
but I don't think people realize the
 
05:57:07.368 --> 05:57:07.378 align:start position:0%
importance for example of having fresh
 
05:57:09.948 --> 05:57:09.958 align:start position:0%
air directed to anything that burns
 
05:57:12.350 --> 05:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
anything in the house whether it's your
 
05:57:15.530 --> 05:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
fireplace or you know gas stove or
 
05:57:17.090 --> 05:57:17.100 align:start position:0%
anything like that without fresh air
 
05:57:19.070 --> 05:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
coming in from Outdoors it's going to
 
05:57:21.170 --> 05:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
come in through leaks all over the house
 
05:57:23.270 --> 05:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:57:25.250 --> 05:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
05:57:26.990 --> 05:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:57:29.208 --> 05:57:29.218 align:start position:0%
taking my question I actually did an
 
05:57:31.128 --> 05:57:31.138 align:start position:0%
analysis similar to this in a completely
 
05:57:33.288 --> 05:57:33.298 align:start position:0%
different context many years ago in an
 
05:57:34.850 --> 05:57:34.860 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship course
 
05:57:37.850 --> 05:57:37.860 align:start position:0%
but it assumed that uh this linear
 
05:57:40.010 --> 05:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
increase as you have here for the linear
 
05:57:42.948 --> 05:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
increase in the actual Energy Efficiency
 
05:57:46.730 --> 05:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
effort is truly a linear increase
 
05:57:48.350 --> 05:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
is that really what we were going to see
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
or or is it more like the first thing
 
05:57:51.830 --> 05:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
you do is going to give you a lot of
 
05:57:53.390 --> 05:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
improvement then the next thing and
 
05:57:54.708 --> 05:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
maybe a little less and you're going to
 
05:57:57.410 --> 05:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
get diminishing returns rather than a
 
05:57:59.390 --> 05:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
linear increase yeah that's a good
 
05:57:59.400 --> 05:58:00.470 align:start position:0%
linear increase yeah that's a good
question

05:58:00.470 --> 05:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:58:03.048 --> 05:58:03.058 align:start position:0%
I don't know I have no way to and in
 
05:58:06.590 --> 05:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
fact I also think that the um that chart
 
05:58:08.810 --> 05:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
on the one side is very steep
 
05:58:11.030 --> 05:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
the the parabola is very Steep and
 
05:58:14.330 --> 05:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
that's way too steep I I don't think
 
05:58:16.788 --> 05:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
um in any building that uh you know a
 
05:58:18.530 --> 05:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars worth of
 
05:58:18.540 --> 05:58:20.030 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars worth of
uh

05:58:20.030 --> 05:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:58:21.770 --> 05:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency is going to
 
05:58:23.330 --> 05:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
immediately produce a thousand dollars
 
05:58:24.890 --> 05:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
worth of reduction in heat or anything
 
05:58:26.628 --> 05:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
like that I think you probably have a
 
05:58:29.030 --> 05:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know one to four or one to five but
 
05:58:33.048 --> 05:58:33.058 align:start position:0%
so your break-even point is five times
 
05:58:36.350 --> 05:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
further out than uh than the sharply
 
05:58:40.190 --> 05:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
Rising Parabola but um again I think all
 
05:58:45.788 --> 05:58:45.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:48.590 --> 05:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
05:58:50.570 --> 05:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um nonetheless
 
05:58:56.090 --> 05:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
could you uh compare or contrast the
 
05:58:58.610 --> 05:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
usefulness or the re and the return on
 
05:59:01.788 --> 05:59:01.798 align:start position:0%
investment between money
 
05:59:04.930 --> 05:59:04.940 align:start position:0%
devoted to Energy Efficiency programs
 
05:59:08.930 --> 05:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
like this and money
 
05:59:13.010 --> 05:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
that we spend on the low income heating
 
05:59:15.230 --> 05:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
energy assistance program in which we
 
05:59:19.128 --> 05:59:19.138 align:start position:0%
just give low-income folks money to pay
 
05:59:20.510 --> 05:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
their bills
 
05:59:22.850 --> 05:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
well this I think there's an economic
 
05:59:24.890 --> 05:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
Story and there's also you know being
 
05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
sympathetic with people but I I think
 
05:59:29.448 --> 05:59:29.458 align:start position:0%
any money you give to somebody for bill
 
05:59:31.610 --> 05:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
paying assistance is going to go
 
05:59:33.770 --> 05:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
straight to the oil company and any
 
05:59:36.650 --> 05:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
money you spend on Energy Efficiency is
 
05:59:38.628 --> 05:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
um it's going to take longer so there's
 
05:59:41.990 --> 05:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of figuring out and so on it's
 
05:59:44.208 --> 05:59:44.218 align:start position:0%
going to take longer for the impact to
 
05:59:46.548 --> 05:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
come back but it will stay in the
 
05:59:48.288 --> 05:59:48.298 align:start position:0%
economy and multiply as I said before
 
05:59:51.350 --> 05:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
but it will also pay for jobs and Energy
 
05:59:53.868 --> 05:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
Efficiency for people who aren't you
 
05:59:55.788 --> 05:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
know all that skilled doesn't take a
 
05:59:57.128 --> 05:59:57.138 align:start position:0%
whole lot to
 
06:00:00.048 --> 06:00:00.058 align:start position:0%
pick a shingle off outside of a house
 
06:00:01.610 --> 06:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
drill a hole
 
06:00:04.970 --> 06:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
blow insulation into the wall cavity
 
06:00:07.610 --> 06:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
put the shingle back you know and go
 
06:00:10.750 --> 06:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
around the house and it's very effective
 
06:00:14.510 --> 06:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
my wife bought a
 
06:00:17.390 --> 06:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
before I married her and maybe that's
 
06:00:19.128 --> 06:00:19.138 align:start position:0%
why I did I don't know but anyway she
 
06:00:21.410 --> 06:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
bought this Grand Old
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
house a big house it might have been the
 
06:00:26.770 --> 06:00:26.780 align:start position:0%
owner of a super I mean in one of these
 
06:00:30.590 --> 06:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
low low price department stores in
 
06:00:32.270 --> 06:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
Boston it was the Raymond's family
 
06:00:34.670 --> 06:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
anyway and it was covered with asbestos
 
06:00:36.350 --> 06:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
shingle which means that people trying
 
06:00:37.868 --> 06:00:37.878 align:start position:0%
to control their heat
 
06:00:40.810 --> 06:00:40.820 align:start position:0%
because it's sort of an insulator anyway
 
06:00:44.270 --> 06:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
you met State Mass Save came in and in
 
06:00:46.548 --> 06:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
six hours drilled holes inside the house
 
06:00:49.070 --> 06:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the in all floors blue
 
06:00:52.190 --> 06:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
insulation throughout the house
 
06:00:52.200 --> 06:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
insulation throughout the house
um

06:00:53.510 --> 06:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:55.610 --> 06:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
and I checked a few years later and I
 
06:00:57.470 --> 06:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
went way to the highest point took the
 
06:00:58.850 --> 06:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
collaborates off and the sheathing off
 
06:01:00.530 --> 06:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
it was packed solid all the way to the
 
06:01:02.690 --> 06:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
top that blowing in cellulose really
 
06:01:04.670 --> 06:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
works anyway
 
06:01:04.680 --> 06:01:06.110 align:start position:0%
works anyway
um

06:01:06.110 --> 06:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:07.610 --> 06:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know she bought the house for
 
06:01:10.490 --> 06:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
110 000 we sold it for 550 and Zillow
 
06:01:13.910 --> 06:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
has it for 1.1 million million because
 
06:01:16.670 --> 06:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
people with that Energy savings can put
 
06:01:18.230 --> 06:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
it into renovation
 
06:01:20.930 --> 06:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
we could take those asbestos shingle off
 
06:01:24.530 --> 06:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
and have a guide do what they call a
 
06:01:27.708 --> 06:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
painting restoration scrape and paint
 
06:01:29.390 --> 06:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
throw away rotten things and replace
 
06:01:31.010 --> 06:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
them and paint it and the house looked
 
06:01:32.830 --> 06:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
terrific when we sold it
 
06:01:35.650 --> 06:01:35.660 align:start position:0%
my wife had to personally
 
06:01:40.548 --> 06:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
get the raccoons out but other than that
 
06:01:42.410 --> 06:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
they're in the
 
06:01:44.510 --> 06:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency work kind of
 
06:01:47.448 --> 06:01:47.458 align:start position:0%
imprisoned uh family raccoon so thank
 
06:01:50.030 --> 06:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
you any I'll
 
06:01:51.948 --> 06:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
I love to tell stories I better shut up
 
06:01:54.110 --> 06:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
before I waste all your time
 
06:01:56.208 --> 06:01:56.218 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions we thank
 
06:01:56.218 --> 06:01:57.230 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions we thank
you

06:01:57.230 --> 06:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:01:59.990 --> 06:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who has not spoken
 
06:02:01.730 --> 06:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
on this bill who would like to speak on
 
06:02:01.740 --> 06:02:05.150 align:start position:0%
on this bill who would like to speak on
it

06:02:05.150 --> 06:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:09.830 --> 06:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will be in recess until 3
 
06:02:12.288 --> 06:02:12.298 align:start position:0%
30 when we will
 
06:02:16.090 --> 06:02:16.100 align:start position:0%
open a public hearing on House Bill 524
 
06:02:19.430 --> 06:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the no that's the wrong one
 
06:02:23.570 --> 06:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
house bill 233 relative to useful
 
06:02:25.310 --> 06:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
thermal energy under the renewable
 
06:02:27.230 --> 06:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
06:30:55.430 --> 06:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:58.788 --> 06:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
here's sitting over there
 
06:30:58.798 --> 06:31:00.470 align:start position:0%
here's sitting over there
okay

06:31:00.470 --> 06:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:31:02.570 --> 06:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna
 
06:31:04.628 --> 06:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
call to order
 
06:31:08.628 --> 06:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
hb233 and introduce representative Rose
 
06:31:12.048 --> 06:31:12.058 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose to introduce his bill
 
06:31:14.288 --> 06:31:14.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair good afternoon
 
06:31:16.670 --> 06:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues I'm here to introduce House
 
06:31:21.288 --> 06:31:21.298 align:start position:0%
Bill 233 FN which is a bill relative to
 
06:31:22.910 --> 06:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
useful thermal energy under the
 
06:31:26.330 --> 06:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard
 
06:31:29.930 --> 06:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
as those of you who know me well know
 
06:31:33.470 --> 06:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
one of my motivations in life is to
 
06:31:36.230 --> 06:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
lower rate payer costs whenever I can
 
06:31:38.510 --> 06:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I've introduced this bill to do just
 
06:31:38.520 --> 06:31:40.368 align:start position:0%
and I've introduced this bill to do just
that

06:31:40.368 --> 06:31:40.378 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:31:44.090 --> 06:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
how will this bill lower ratepayer costs
 
06:31:46.368 --> 06:31:46.378 align:start position:0%
it will lower them by increasing the
 
06:31:49.128 --> 06:31:49.138 align:start position:0%
number of thermal wrecks that are
 
06:31:52.970 --> 06:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
available for purchase by utilities
 
06:31:55.490 --> 06:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
and by increasing that number it will
 
06:31:57.590 --> 06:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
also lower the number of alternative
 
06:32:00.288 --> 06:32:00.298 align:start position:0%
compliance payments that the utilities
 
06:32:03.288 --> 06:32:03.298 align:start position:0%
must make when there is a shortage of
 
06:32:07.490 --> 06:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
these thermal class 1 thermal wrecks
 
06:32:09.770 --> 06:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
because alternative compliance payments
 
06:32:11.930 --> 06:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
are more expensive than Rex
 
06:32:14.330 --> 06:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
so if there are more wrecks
 
06:32:16.730 --> 06:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
and fewer acps
 
06:32:19.368 --> 06:32:19.378 align:start position:0%
rate payer costs will go down
 
06:32:23.570 --> 06:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
that's the motivation behind this bill
 
06:32:25.910 --> 06:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
a secondary motivation
 
06:32:28.190 --> 06:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
is a
 
06:32:30.948 --> 06:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
somewhat cultural motivation
 
06:32:32.810 --> 06:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
as any of you who have visited a
 
06:32:35.990 --> 06:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
historical society in New Hampshire have
 
06:32:37.850 --> 06:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
noticed if you look at photographs that
 
06:32:41.090 --> 06:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
were taken back in the early days of
 
06:32:45.110 --> 06:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
Photography 1840 1850
 
06:32:47.570 --> 06:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
the one feature you'll notice about
 
06:32:49.490 --> 06:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
photographs taken in New Hampshire back
 
06:32:52.548 --> 06:32:52.558 align:start position:0%
then if there are photographs of the
 
06:32:52.558 --> 06:32:54.170 align:start position:0%
then if there are photographs of the
landscape

06:32:54.170 --> 06:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
landscape
 
06:32:58.788 --> 06:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
is an amazing absence of trees
 
06:33:01.910 --> 06:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
by 1840 in New Hampshire there were very
 
06:33:04.250 --> 06:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
few trees left
 
06:33:06.170 --> 06:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
because people cut them all down to
 
06:33:07.310 --> 06:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
build homes
 
06:33:11.208 --> 06:33:11.218 align:start position:0%
heat homes and cook food
 
06:33:15.590 --> 06:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
so there is a a cultural
 
06:33:17.750 --> 06:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
thread that runs through our existence
 
06:33:20.030 --> 06:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that burning wood
 
06:33:22.850 --> 06:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
is a good thing for us to do we've we've
 
06:33:25.430 --> 06:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
done it for years and years and years
 
06:33:26.690 --> 06:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
if you look around at New Hampshire
 
06:33:27.890 --> 06:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
today though
 
06:33:29.690 --> 06:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
there is tons of wood out there that
 
06:33:31.850 --> 06:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
we're obviously not burning
 
06:33:34.850 --> 06:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
and as you've heard people testify
 
06:33:37.548 --> 06:33:37.558 align:start position:0%
before this committee before
 
06:33:39.288 --> 06:33:39.298 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the wood in New Hampshire
 
06:33:41.770 --> 06:33:41.780 align:start position:0%
is low-grade wood it's really not good
 
06:33:46.250 --> 06:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
to use to build houses make furniture or
 
06:33:48.890 --> 06:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
do other useful things with wood but
 
06:33:51.410 --> 06:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's great for burning
 
06:33:53.510 --> 06:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
you can burn it to make electricity as
 
06:33:55.670 --> 06:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
the biomass plants do a couple of them
 
06:33:56.628 --> 06:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
up north
 
06:34:00.410 --> 06:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
or you can burn it in a wood stove or a
 
06:34:02.750 --> 06:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
wood boiler
 
06:34:05.690 --> 06:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
and while it's not the most efficient
 
06:34:08.090 --> 06:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
way to heat a house
 
06:34:10.610 --> 06:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
the BTUs and wood are
 
06:34:14.750 --> 06:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
fewer than the BTUs and some other fuels
 
06:34:19.128 --> 06:34:19.138 align:start position:0%
nevertheless it does work and
 
06:34:22.250 --> 06:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
as one of my friends recently reported
 
06:34:24.770 --> 06:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
to me he's been burning wood in New
 
06:34:27.470 --> 06:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for most of his life and he
 
06:34:29.990 --> 06:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
recently converted from a wood stove to
 
06:34:32.150 --> 06:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
a wood pellet stove and he said he
 
06:34:34.910 --> 06:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't believe how much more efficient
 
06:34:38.448 --> 06:34:38.458 align:start position:0%
a wood pellet stove was then his older
 
06:34:40.310 --> 06:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
more traditional
 
06:34:44.150 --> 06:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:46.490 --> 06:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it actually
 
06:34:48.530 --> 06:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
makes it easier
 
06:34:51.530 --> 06:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
for and more affordable for people to
 
06:34:51.540 --> 06:34:53.150 align:start position:0%
for and more affordable for people to
install

06:34:53.150 --> 06:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
install
 
06:34:56.930 --> 06:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
wood boilers and apply for renewable
 
06:35:01.070 --> 06:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:03.350 --> 06:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
the way the log currently
 
06:35:05.090 --> 06:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
is written
 
06:35:08.330 --> 06:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
in order to prove that the wood you're
 
06:35:11.270 --> 06:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
using in your wood boiler is equivalent
 
06:35:11.280 --> 06:35:12.830 align:start position:0%
using in your wood boiler is equivalent
to

06:35:12.830 --> 06:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:35:15.948 --> 06:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
certain megawatt hours of electricity to
 
06:35:19.250 --> 06:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
qualify for a wreck you need a meter you
 
06:35:22.128 --> 06:35:22.138 align:start position:0%
need to be able to meter the BTUs
 
06:35:24.288 --> 06:35:24.298 align:start position:0%
and then there's a table that you can
 
06:35:28.250 --> 06:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
use to to calculate
 
06:35:31.910 --> 06:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
based on how many BTUs you use how many
 
06:35:34.490 --> 06:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
wrecks you could qualify for
 
06:35:36.470 --> 06:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
those meters however are kind of
 
06:35:36.480 --> 06:35:37.490 align:start position:0%
those meters however are kind of
expensive

06:35:37.490 --> 06:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
06:35:39.410 --> 06:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
and the average homeowner probably can't
 
06:35:42.708 --> 06:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
afford to buy such a meter
 
06:35:44.868 --> 06:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
so they
 
06:35:47.750 --> 06:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
are unable basically to apply for class
 
06:35:50.628 --> 06:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
one thermal Rex as a result
 
06:35:53.030 --> 06:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
what this bill will do
 
06:35:55.970 --> 06:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
is remove the requirement for a meter
 
06:35:57.948 --> 06:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
and ask the department of energy to come
 
06:36:02.330 --> 06:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
up with an alternative way to calculate
 
06:36:05.030 --> 06:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
based on the amount of wood that's being
 
06:36:08.330 --> 06:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
burned but being used typically wood
 
06:36:08.340 --> 06:36:10.128 align:start position:0%
burned but being used typically wood
chips

06:36:10.128 --> 06:36:10.138 align:start position:0%
chips
 
06:36:13.490 --> 06:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
to come up with a way to to verify what
 
06:36:17.810 --> 06:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
the the equivalent in megawatt hours
 
06:36:20.150 --> 06:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
would be so that people could qualify
 
06:36:23.208 --> 06:36:23.218 align:start position:0%
for class 1 thermal Rex
 
06:36:27.830 --> 06:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:30.170 --> 06:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
may or may not accomplish that purpose
 
06:36:32.650 --> 06:36:32.660 align:start position:0%
the department of energy will testify
 
06:36:35.030 --> 06:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
once I'm done here
 
06:36:38.030 --> 06:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
that they have alternative language that
 
06:36:40.250 --> 06:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
they think might work better
 
06:36:43.128 --> 06:36:43.138 align:start position:0%
to accomplish the same purpose
 
06:36:45.048 --> 06:36:45.058 align:start position:0%
and that's fine with me I don't care
 
06:36:46.970 --> 06:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
what language we end up using I don't
 
06:36:49.850 --> 06:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
care what part of Statute we end up
 
06:36:52.430 --> 06:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
modifying as long as we accomplish the
 
06:36:56.410 --> 06:36:56.420 align:start position:0%
purpose which is to expand
 
06:37:01.310 --> 06:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
the ability of wood burners to qualify
 
06:37:03.708 --> 06:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
for class one thermal Rex
 
06:37:05.628 --> 06:37:05.638 align:start position:0%
because the more of those wrecks that
 
06:37:07.010 --> 06:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
are out there
 
06:37:10.788 --> 06:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
the lower cost will be for rate bears
 
06:37:12.650 --> 06:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
so that's uh
 
06:37:14.868 --> 06:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
my rationale for doing this bill I'm not
 
06:37:15.948 --> 06:37:15.958 align:start position:0%
going to go any further because there's
 
06:37:17.150 --> 06:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of other people who want to
 
06:37:19.310 --> 06:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
testify but I'm happy to take questions
 
06:37:23.150 --> 06:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:25.788 --> 06:37:25.798 align:start position:0%
uh looks like you didn't get your point
 
06:37:25.798 --> 06:37:26.890 align:start position:0%
uh looks like you didn't get your point
so

06:37:26.890 --> 06:37:26.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:37:29.510 --> 06:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
but I'll call on uh representative
 
06:37:31.610 --> 06:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
Winnie Thomas first thank you very much
 
06:37:33.350 --> 06:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chair
 
06:37:36.470 --> 06:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
um on line four it says that um verified
 
06:37:38.750 --> 06:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
by a method that is satisfactory to the
 
06:37:40.250 --> 06:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
Department of energy could you define
 
06:37:40.260 --> 06:37:45.170 align:start position:0%
Department of energy could you define
satisfactory

06:37:45.170 --> 06:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:47.030 --> 06:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
that is a nebulous term I would agree
 
06:37:50.750 --> 06:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
but uh one that it basically means that
 
06:37:52.548 --> 06:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
a method that the department would
 
06:37:56.810 --> 06:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
accept as verification of the amount of
 
06:37:59.810 --> 06:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
energy used and its equivalent in
 
06:38:03.110 --> 06:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
Rec applicable energy follow-up
 
06:38:06.590 --> 06:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you by giving the sole
 
06:38:09.170 --> 06:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
authority to the doe could this method
 
06:38:11.510 --> 06:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
be in any way abused
 
06:38:16.610 --> 06:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:18.530 --> 06:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'll let the com the department comment
 
06:38:21.410 --> 06:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
on that thank you very much
 
06:38:23.990 --> 06:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan
 
06:38:26.390 --> 06:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and thank you uh
 
06:38:27.470 --> 06:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
06:38:29.810 --> 06:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
for uh presenting this um I just have a
 
06:38:31.310 --> 06:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
question maybe you can answer it I don't
 
06:38:33.708 --> 06:38:33.718 align:start position:0%
know because it's not Apparent from the
 
06:38:35.350 --> 06:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
language of the bill but you did mention
 
06:38:37.970 --> 06:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh you want to increase Rex for people
 
06:38:39.530 --> 06:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
who are burning wood would that include
 
06:38:41.750 --> 06:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
any kind of wood stove or is it just
 
06:38:44.810 --> 06:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
simply in your mind limited to pellet uh
 
06:38:49.070 --> 06:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
boilers or do you have a specific uh
 
06:38:51.350 --> 06:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
type of wood burning apparatus that you
 
06:38:53.750 --> 06:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
have in mind
 
06:38:55.730 --> 06:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
personally I'd like to see it apply to
 
06:38:57.708 --> 06:38:57.718 align:start position:0%
any kind of wood burning but there are
 
06:38:59.750 --> 06:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
people who will testify asked after me
 
06:39:01.548 --> 06:39:01.558 align:start position:0%
who can answer that question more
 
06:39:04.250 --> 06:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
precisely people who involve directly
 
06:39:08.330 --> 06:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
involved in the wood industry and in the
 
06:39:13.910 --> 06:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:15.770 --> 06:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative Coleman
 
06:39:15.780 --> 06:39:17.390 align:start position:0%
representative Coleman
Corman

06:39:17.390 --> 06:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
Corman
 
06:39:19.070 --> 06:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
you look like a Coleman but that's okay
 
06:39:21.470 --> 06:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
my apologies do I look like a camping
 
06:39:21.480 --> 06:39:22.750 align:start position:0%
my apologies do I look like a camping
tent

06:39:22.750 --> 06:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
tent
 
06:39:26.090 --> 06:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and thank you Mr
 
06:39:27.770 --> 06:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
chairman for taking my question so I
 
06:39:29.150 --> 06:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I understand so I
 
06:39:31.430 --> 06:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
have a wood stove at home and I burn
 
06:39:33.530 --> 06:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
about two cords two three chords a year
 
06:39:37.010 --> 06:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
so in in in your view in your fantasy
 
06:39:38.810 --> 06:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
world right maybe not fantasy world in
 
06:39:41.270 --> 06:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
your Ideal World let me put it that way
 
06:39:43.190 --> 06:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
um I could actually apply for Rex doing
 
06:39:43.200 --> 06:39:44.330 align:start position:0%
um I could actually apply for Rex doing
that

06:39:44.330 --> 06:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:39:48.230 --> 06:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
you could oh okay absolutely okay thanks
 
06:39:52.190 --> 06:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:54.048 --> 06:39:54.058 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking out
 
06:39:55.788 --> 06:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
this question
 
06:39:57.590 --> 06:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and I imagine we will probably be
 
06:39:59.208 --> 06:39:59.218 align:start position:0%
seeing an amendment on this so I'm going
 
06:40:00.948 --> 06:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
to try to limit my questions to some
 
06:40:00.958 --> 06:40:02.448 align:start position:0%
to try to limit my questions to some
degree

06:40:02.448 --> 06:40:02.458 align:start position:0%
degree
 
06:40:04.430 --> 06:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
um but and you know I'm a big believer
 
06:40:08.448 --> 06:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
in Homegrown Solutions and wood is to my
 
06:40:11.510 --> 06:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
mind a renewable in New Hampshire
 
06:40:13.910 --> 06:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and I understand the barriers uh
 
06:40:17.590 --> 06:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
posed by trying to meet her
 
06:40:19.970 --> 06:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh wood in order to come up with a
 
06:40:21.948 --> 06:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
verifiable wreck
 
06:40:21.958 --> 06:40:22.850 align:start position:0%
verifiable wreck
um

06:40:22.850 --> 06:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:25.430 --> 06:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
there are other Industries in New
 
06:40:26.990 --> 06:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire other Renewables will produce
 
06:40:30.288 --> 06:40:30.298 align:start position:0%
racks as well could you see uh applying
 
06:40:33.350 --> 06:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
this verification process to any other
 
06:40:36.230 --> 06:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire Renewables that are
 
06:40:39.048 --> 06:40:39.058 align:start position:0%
eligible for Rex
 
06:40:40.970 --> 06:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
I can't thank any off the top of my head
 
06:40:43.010 --> 06:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
but that's a subject for another day
 
06:40:45.590 --> 06:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
that we could explore certainly I think
 
06:40:47.868 --> 06:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
I think for this bill we'd want to
 
06:40:51.708 --> 06:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
confine our effort to getting class one
 
06:40:54.410 --> 06:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
thermal Rex I I should have been
 
06:40:58.010 --> 06:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:00.410 --> 06:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
I have one quick question if this bill
 
06:41:05.270 --> 06:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:06.708 --> 06:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
increase the market for the wood
 
06:41:06.718 --> 06:41:07.970 align:start position:0%
increase the market for the wood
industry

06:41:07.970 --> 06:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
industry
 
06:41:10.490 --> 06:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
I believe it would because if more
 
06:41:13.628 --> 06:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
people are able to to get Wrecks for
 
06:41:16.190 --> 06:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
installing wood pellet stoves and more
 
06:41:19.128 --> 06:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
people might do just that so it might
 
06:41:21.708 --> 06:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
stimulate not only the the burner
 
06:41:24.410 --> 06:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
business but also the the wood
 
06:41:26.750 --> 06:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
harvesting business because there'd be
 
06:41:29.270 --> 06:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
more demand for pellets
 
06:41:31.730 --> 06:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
great seeing no other questions thank
 
06:41:35.030 --> 06:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
you for Testimony Mr chair and I will
 
06:41:39.230 --> 06:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
call upon uh Josh Elliott Elliott from
 
06:41:39.240 --> 06:41:51.288 align:start position:0%
call upon uh Josh Elliott Elliott from
Doe

06:41:51.288 --> 06:41:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:53.510 --> 06:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr Vice chairman members
 
06:41:54.650 --> 06:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
of the committee again for the record
 
06:41:56.510 --> 06:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
Josh Elliott director of the division of
 
06:41:58.070 --> 06:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
policy and programs with the New
 
06:42:00.048 --> 06:42:00.058 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy the
 
06:42:01.910 --> 06:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on this bill
 
06:42:04.128 --> 06:42:04.138 align:start position:0%
um as the prime sponsor had mentioned
 
06:42:06.708 --> 06:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
sort of the goal of this is that we also
 
06:42:08.810 --> 06:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
see the department is to increase the
 
06:42:11.270 --> 06:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
number of thermal wrecks or T-rex as
 
06:42:12.590 --> 06:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
they are called I think that's probably
 
06:42:13.910 --> 06:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
the most fun acronym we have the
 
06:42:15.650 --> 06:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
department but
 
06:42:15.660 --> 06:42:17.510 align:start position:0%
department but
um

06:42:17.510 --> 06:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:20.208 --> 06:42:20.218 align:start position:0%
that are available for purchase
 
06:42:20.218 --> 06:42:20.868 align:start position:0%
that are available for purchase
um

06:42:20.868 --> 06:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:24.110 --> 06:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
in our uh last annual report for the
 
06:42:25.788 --> 06:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund
 
06:42:28.970 --> 06:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
um acps and the value of uh just over
 
06:42:31.610 --> 06:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
2.8 million dollars were made
 
06:42:33.830 --> 06:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
um just for thermal racks for these
 
06:42:36.110 --> 06:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
T-Rex for class 1 thermal Rex
 
06:42:37.548 --> 06:42:37.558 align:start position:0%
um so there's definitely a shortage of
 
06:42:39.890 --> 06:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
these wrecks that are available
 
06:42:42.770 --> 06:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
um in the market uh which means that the
 
06:42:44.330 --> 06:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utilities as well
 
06:42:46.190 --> 06:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
as competitive suppliers are then
 
06:42:47.448 --> 06:42:47.458 align:start position:0%
required to make those alternative
 
06:42:51.170 --> 06:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
compliance payments so um as the prime
 
06:42:53.330 --> 06:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
sponsor had mentioned we do have a
 
06:42:55.970 --> 06:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
couple of suggestions about ways that
 
06:42:57.708 --> 06:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
the bill could be improved I do have
 
06:42:59.208 --> 06:42:59.218 align:start position:0%
suggestions of language I want to be
 
06:43:01.128 --> 06:43:01.138 align:start position:0%
careful I know my colleague Mr Roberge
 
06:43:04.368 --> 06:43:04.378 align:start position:0%
is far more versed in house committee
 
06:43:06.410 --> 06:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
rule process so I want to be very
 
06:43:08.208 --> 06:43:08.218 align:start position:0%
careful um please cut me off if I'm
 
06:43:10.128 --> 06:43:10.138 align:start position:0%
wandering too far astray but essentially
 
06:43:11.868 --> 06:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to distribute these as
 
06:43:11.878 --> 06:43:12.670 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to distribute these as
well

06:43:12.670 --> 06:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:43:17.570 --> 06:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
that if we bifurcate the uh the current
 
06:43:17.580 --> 06:43:18.850 align:start position:0%
that if we bifurcate the uh the current
statute

06:43:18.850 --> 06:43:18.860 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:43:23.230 --> 06:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
leaving the existing stat attitude for
 
06:43:25.368 --> 06:43:25.378 align:start position:0%
large let me just make sure I'm
 
06:43:27.310 --> 06:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
referring to the correct
 
06:43:29.868 --> 06:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
reference here yes if we distinguish
 
06:43:32.570 --> 06:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
between large thermal sources and small
 
06:43:35.690 --> 06:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
thermal sources so small thermal sources
 
06:43:38.270 --> 06:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
are defined in POC rules which will
 
06:43:41.810 --> 06:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
eventually become doe rules of of 1
 
06:43:44.990 --> 06:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
million btu or less
 
06:43:45.000 --> 06:43:46.010 align:start position:0%
million btu or less
so

06:43:46.010 --> 06:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:43:47.868 --> 06:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
the goal of that and a lot of these
 
06:43:50.090 --> 06:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
smaller units as the prime sponsor had
 
06:43:52.910 --> 06:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's not cost effective for
 
06:43:55.128 --> 06:43:55.138 align:start position:0%
the owner to put in one of these meters
 
06:43:56.810 --> 06:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
usually the meter ends up costing just
 
06:43:58.490 --> 06:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
as much as the installation of the
 
06:43:59.990 --> 06:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
system so it doesn't really make sense
 
06:44:01.910 --> 06:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
for on a small scale to actually install
 
06:44:01.920 --> 06:44:03.010 align:start position:0%
for on a small scale to actually install
these

06:44:03.010 --> 06:44:03.020 align:start position:0%
these
 
06:44:06.590 --> 06:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
so the the suggested language would
 
06:44:08.390 --> 06:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
bifurcate that leave the existing
 
06:44:10.368 --> 06:44:10.378 align:start position:0%
Statute in place for the large thermal
 
06:44:12.708 --> 06:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
sources so your you know your Wood-Fired
 
06:44:14.810 --> 06:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
power plants your larger things larger
 
06:44:16.670 --> 06:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
sources that can afford and it makes
 
06:44:19.128 --> 06:44:19.138 align:start position:0%
sense as part of their calculus and
 
06:44:20.868 --> 06:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
installing these systems to put those in
 
06:44:23.030 --> 06:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
but for the you know average residential
 
06:44:24.590 --> 06:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
homeowner who may have a wood pellet
 
06:44:27.288 --> 06:44:27.298 align:start position:0%
boiler as their heating Source rather
 
06:44:29.090 --> 06:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
than spending double the amount just to
 
06:44:30.650 --> 06:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
get a meter there would be an
 
06:44:31.910 --> 06:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
alternative measure come up by the
 
06:44:33.770 --> 06:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
department in order to make them
 
06:44:37.490 --> 06:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
eligible to generate T-Rex
 
06:44:40.070 --> 06:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
so with that I I'm happy to pass out
 
06:44:41.510 --> 06:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
suggested language but I don't again
 
06:44:43.548 --> 06:44:43.558 align:start position:0%
don't want to run a foul of any
 
06:44:45.770 --> 06:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
committee procedures you you said you
 
06:44:47.390 --> 06:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
had something written down for all of us
 
06:44:49.548 --> 06:44:49.558 align:start position:0%
or just yes yes I have copies you can
 
06:44:51.350 --> 06:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
you can pass it around we'll keep it for
 
06:44:51.360 --> 06:44:52.310 align:start position:0%
you can pass it around we'll keep it for
uh

06:44:52.310 --> 06:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:44:55.850 --> 06:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:58.368 --> 06:44:58.378 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that that's an amendment or
 
06:45:02.330 --> 06:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
or just suggestions it is um they are I
 
06:45:03.590 --> 06:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
just suggested language so it's not in
 
06:45:05.628 --> 06:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
the official OLS version oh okay okay
 
06:45:08.810 --> 06:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
fine okay thank you so with that uh Mr
 
06:45:10.610 --> 06:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
chair Mr Vice chair excuse me I'm happy
 
06:45:12.350 --> 06:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
to take any questions the committee may
 
06:45:12.360 --> 06:45:16.670 align:start position:0%
to take any questions the committee may
have

06:45:16.670 --> 06:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:18.948 --> 06:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
representative ones
 
06:45:21.770 --> 06:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:45:23.390 --> 06:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:45:23.400 --> 06:45:23.990 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

06:45:23.990 --> 06:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:25.610 --> 06:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not sure if you're the
 
06:45:28.128 --> 06:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
right person to ask this or not but I
 
06:45:30.410 --> 06:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
was struggling a little bit with the
 
06:45:33.530 --> 06:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
language in paragraph two
 
06:45:36.170 --> 06:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
um and and and trying to reconcile that
 
06:45:37.730 --> 06:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
with the language in paragraph one
 
06:45:40.850 --> 06:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
paragraph one seems seemed to say that
 
06:45:40.860 --> 06:45:41.448 align:start position:0%
paragraph one seems seemed to say that
um

06:45:41.448 --> 06:45:41.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:43.250 --> 06:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
you know the department is going to
 
06:45:46.390 --> 06:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
Define an approach on how to handle
 
06:45:46.400 --> 06:45:48.250 align:start position:0%
Define an approach on how to handle
measuring

06:45:48.250 --> 06:45:48.260 align:start position:0%
measuring
 
06:45:50.750 --> 06:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
thermal output and then paragraph two
 
06:45:52.850 --> 06:45:52.860 align:start position:0%
kind of says but you know if somebody
 
06:45:54.948 --> 06:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
has a different approach then maybe the
 
06:45:57.288 --> 06:45:57.298 align:start position:0%
department is willing to accept that
 
06:46:00.048 --> 06:46:00.058 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if I misread that or if
 
06:46:03.590 --> 06:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
that to me seemed kind of problematic
 
06:46:06.948 --> 06:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
it um I would be hopeful that any
 
06:46:08.750 --> 06:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
methodology that the department would
 
06:46:10.430 --> 06:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
come up with we would go through
 
06:46:11.930 --> 06:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
probably we would I shouldn't say
 
06:46:12.890 --> 06:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
probably we would go through a
 
06:46:14.510 --> 06:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholder process to get input from
 
06:46:17.208 --> 06:46:17.218 align:start position:0%
folks either who are users who gen who
 
06:46:19.010 --> 06:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
you know either who install these types
 
06:46:20.570 --> 06:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
of systems to figure out okay what's the
 
06:46:23.208 --> 06:46:23.218 align:start position:0%
best way to really be measuring them
 
06:46:24.770 --> 06:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
um but to your point yes you could run
 
06:46:26.810 --> 06:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
into a situation of where maybe there's
 
06:46:28.610 --> 06:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
a disagreement half the folks think one
 
06:46:30.830 --> 06:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
way is the best had another folks other
 
06:46:32.270 --> 06:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
folks I think the other way is the best
 
06:46:34.128 --> 06:46:34.138 align:start position:0%
and then we sort of get get stuck in the
 
06:46:36.288 --> 06:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
middle of trying to sort out which which
 
06:46:38.270 --> 06:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
methodology should be used and then
 
06:46:41.690 --> 06:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
we're in theory dealing with a um
 
06:46:44.810 --> 06:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
a potential onslaught of waiver requests
 
06:46:46.190 --> 06:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
that have to be reviewed and then either
 
06:46:49.990 --> 06:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:52.670 --> 06:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan
 
06:46:54.830 --> 06:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I'll go thank you Mr by
 
06:46:56.330 --> 06:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
Sarah um I guess I'll ask this question
 
06:46:57.770 --> 06:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
it might be jumping the gun a little bit
 
06:46:59.390 --> 06:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
you mentioned rule making in terms of
 
06:47:02.628 --> 06:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
the methodology but uh I'm just curious
 
06:47:04.968 --> 06:47:04.978 align:start position:0%
would would in your mind with that
 
06:47:08.270 --> 06:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
methodology have to include some sort of
 
06:47:08.280 --> 06:47:09.190 align:start position:0%
methodology have to include some sort of
uh

06:47:09.190 --> 06:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:47:12.170 --> 06:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
prerequisite that whatever residence was
 
06:47:13.548 --> 06:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
applying would have to be you know
 
06:47:15.350 --> 06:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
adequately insulated before they could
 
06:47:17.690 --> 06:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
apply for something like this
 
06:47:19.190 --> 06:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
um how do you do you mean insulating
 
06:47:20.868 --> 06:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
like their home has to be insulated oh
 
06:47:22.010 --> 06:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't just be you know
 
06:47:23.208 --> 06:47:23.218 align:start position:0%
burning a whole bunch in order to
 
06:47:25.430 --> 06:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
generate a whole bunch of wrecks yeah
 
06:47:27.170 --> 06:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
um I think that probably if I were to
 
06:47:27.180 --> 06:47:27.948 align:start position:0%
um I think that probably if I were to
guess

06:47:27.948 --> 06:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
guess
 
06:47:29.448 --> 06:47:29.458 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question if I were
 
06:47:33.110 --> 06:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
to guess I would think that the value of
 
06:47:33.120 --> 06:47:34.548 align:start position:0%
to guess I would think that the value of
the

06:47:34.548 --> 06:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:47:36.948 --> 06:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
um the the wood that you're putting in
 
06:47:39.170 --> 06:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
um in order to burn would probably be
 
06:47:40.850 --> 06:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
more valuable than the racks you would
 
06:47:42.590 --> 06:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
happen to be generating
 
06:47:43.968 --> 06:47:43.978 align:start position:0%
um but that's not to say that you could
 
06:47:45.590 --> 06:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
end up with some right you wouldn't want
 
06:47:47.270 --> 06:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
to end up with some absurd result of
 
06:47:48.650 --> 06:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
where you have somebody who's just
 
06:47:50.030 --> 06:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
essentially burning a whole bunch of
 
06:47:51.770 --> 06:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
wood and then just minting wrecks that
 
06:47:51.780 --> 06:47:54.170 align:start position:0%
wood and then just minting wrecks that
way

06:47:54.170 --> 06:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:56.448 --> 06:47:56.458 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
06:47:58.910 --> 06:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and thank you
 
06:48:00.948 --> 06:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I'm still just
 
06:48:02.330 --> 06:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
trying to understand
 
06:48:05.030 --> 06:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
um a means of verifying the useful
 
06:48:08.390 --> 06:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
energy output so you know let's say as I
 
06:48:10.190 --> 06:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
was asking before I I'm at home I'm
 
06:48:13.310 --> 06:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
burning my two to three chords a year
 
06:48:16.968 --> 06:48:16.978 align:start position:0%
how could we measure that that output
 
06:48:19.430 --> 06:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
would it be that I present my bill from
 
06:48:21.530 --> 06:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
the guy who supplies my wood and what if
 
06:48:23.150 --> 06:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm supplying my own wood and don't have
 
06:48:26.330 --> 06:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
a bill I mean how would this work
 
06:48:27.590 --> 06:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I was
 
06:48:29.570 --> 06:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
actually thinking of that in the back in
 
06:48:32.868 --> 06:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
terms of of how you do for how you would
 
06:48:34.368 --> 06:48:34.378 align:start position:0%
adequately measure for somebody who is
 
06:48:36.170 --> 06:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
essentially self-reporting right they
 
06:48:37.730 --> 06:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
may have a bunch of Timberland on there
 
06:48:39.110 --> 06:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
on their property
 
06:48:40.310 --> 06:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
um and they're using that that one I
 
06:48:42.230 --> 06:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
think is a bit of a harder question to
 
06:48:44.208 --> 06:48:44.218 align:start position:0%
answer but certainly something we would
 
06:48:45.770 --> 06:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
certainly have to consider as part of
 
06:48:48.830 --> 06:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
this for somebody who gets Uh Wood
 
06:48:50.448 --> 06:48:50.458 align:start position:0%
delivered so whether it's either in a
 
06:48:51.948 --> 06:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
pelletized form
 
06:48:53.690 --> 06:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
um or their you know dimensional wood
 
06:48:56.510 --> 06:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
chips or something like that there's a
 
06:48:58.730 --> 06:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
um you know they're generally treated to
 
06:49:02.330 --> 06:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
an extent of where you can be able to
 
06:49:04.190 --> 06:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
measure by weight so you'll basically
 
06:49:06.230 --> 06:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
rather than you know think of like uh if
 
06:49:08.090 --> 06:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
you're oil or propane you get a certain
 
06:49:09.770 --> 06:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
gallons you know how many you know how
 
06:49:11.750 --> 06:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
much you can get out of each gallon the
 
06:49:14.030 --> 06:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
same idea assuming that the wood chips
 
06:49:15.288 --> 06:49:15.298 align:start position:0%
and the pellets are treated to certain
 
06:49:15.298 --> 06:49:17.030 align:start position:0%
and the pellets are treated to certain
conditions

06:49:17.030 --> 06:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
06:49:18.708 --> 06:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
um you know they're at the same uh or
 
06:49:20.090 --> 06:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
within the same ballpark of sort of
 
06:49:22.850 --> 06:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
moisture content and things like that
 
06:49:24.830 --> 06:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
um that you'd be able to come up with
 
06:49:27.948 --> 06:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
some methodology again that only counts
 
06:49:29.810 --> 06:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
for deliverable when you get it off you
 
06:49:30.830 --> 06:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
know get it off the truck there's a
 
06:49:32.510 --> 06:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
blower it
 
06:49:34.430 --> 06:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
um into whatever holding container but
 
06:49:36.170 --> 06:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
to your point yes for somebody who's
 
06:49:37.670 --> 06:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
doing it themselves they're cutting wood
 
06:49:39.830 --> 06:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
on their back lot it gets a little
 
06:49:39.840 --> 06:49:42.890 align:start position:0%
on their back lot it gets a little
trickier

06:49:42.890 --> 06:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:45.170 --> 06:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
representative otter
 
06:49:46.968 --> 06:49:46.978 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I had to write
 
06:49:48.530 --> 06:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
this a couple times so I can incorporate
 
06:49:52.010 --> 06:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
T-Rex another question thank you for
 
06:49:54.230 --> 06:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
larger systems qualifying for T-Rex
 
06:49:56.030 --> 06:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
requires meeting certain emission
 
06:50:00.770 --> 06:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:02.628 --> 06:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
that is a good question I would have to
 
06:50:04.430 --> 06:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
check with the rest of the statute
 
06:50:05.830 --> 06:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
um I know our colleagues at DES
 
06:50:08.628 --> 06:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
generally regulate error emissions
 
06:50:09.948 --> 06:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
um and I would need to I would need to
 
06:50:11.628 --> 06:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
confer with them before I gave you a
 
06:50:14.390 --> 06:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
firm answer on that
 
06:50:16.850 --> 06:50:16.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up and you'll get back to us yes
 
06:50:19.730 --> 06:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
with that thank you yes of course
 
06:50:21.770 --> 06:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
06:50:23.208 --> 06:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:50:25.368 --> 06:50:25.378 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh quick question I
 
06:50:27.170 --> 06:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
have we hear plenty of testimony about
 
06:50:29.448 --> 06:50:29.458 align:start position:0%
how New Hampshire should be able to
 
06:50:32.330 --> 06:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
follow the lead or mirror or match what
 
06:50:34.070 --> 06:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
other states in New England around us
 
06:50:35.868 --> 06:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
are doing when it comes to Renewables
 
06:50:38.150 --> 06:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
and if we were where to follow the state
 
06:50:41.030 --> 06:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
below south of us Massachusetts I
 
06:50:43.548 --> 06:50:43.558 align:start position:0%
believe is it true that they view
 
06:50:47.150 --> 06:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
burning wood as not a renewable
 
06:50:48.830 --> 06:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for the question
 
06:50:50.330 --> 06:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
um that is correct they are in the
 
06:50:51.770 --> 06:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
process I don't know if they're they've
 
06:50:52.910 --> 06:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
quite finished yet but they're in the
 
06:50:54.650 --> 06:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
process of removing um what we would
 
06:50:57.350 --> 06:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
consider class 3 biomass Recs
 
06:50:59.690 --> 06:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
um as as eligible for uh renewable
 
06:50:59.700 --> 06:51:03.530 align:start position:0%
um as as eligible for uh renewable
generation

06:51:03.530 --> 06:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:05.270 --> 06:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative Winnie Thomas
 
06:51:07.490 --> 06:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair
 
06:51:07.500 --> 06:51:08.208 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair
um

06:51:08.208 --> 06:51:08.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:11.690 --> 06:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
in this process would there be a process
 
06:51:17.150 --> 06:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:19.850 --> 06:51:19.860 align:start position:0%
I would thank you for the question
 
06:51:21.650 --> 06:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
um it's not specified specifically in
 
06:51:24.048 --> 06:51:24.058 align:start position:0%
the statute I think generally uh
 
06:51:25.788 --> 06:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
regarding best practices there would
 
06:51:27.890 --> 06:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
probably be some sort of appeal decision
 
06:51:29.810 --> 06:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
or if there's some
 
06:51:33.770 --> 06:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
um uh some sort of um or grounds for an
 
06:51:36.410 --> 06:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
appeal I think the department if if the
 
06:51:37.610 --> 06:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
committee decide to move forward with
 
06:51:39.288 --> 06:51:39.298 align:start position:0%
the bill I think we would
 
06:51:41.990 --> 06:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
um uh we would not be we would not be
 
06:51:43.670 --> 06:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
hostile to the idea that an appeal
 
06:51:44.990 --> 06:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
process would be put in I think it was
 
06:51:47.090 --> 06:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
General best practice thank you thank
 
06:51:47.100 --> 06:51:48.170 align:start position:0%
General best practice thank you thank
you

06:51:48.170 --> 06:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:51:50.030 --> 06:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
okay I think we'll move on thank you so
 
06:51:50.040 --> 06:51:51.288 align:start position:0%
okay I think we'll move on thank you so
much

06:51:51.288 --> 06:51:51.298 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:51:53.270 --> 06:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I didn't you didn't have your
 
06:51:56.330 --> 06:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:57.948 --> 06:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Vice chair
 
06:51:59.570 --> 06:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
um and thanks for the uh taking my
 
06:51:59.580 --> 06:52:01.070 align:start position:0%
um and thanks for the uh taking my
question

06:52:01.070 --> 06:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:52:03.788 --> 06:52:03.798 align:start position:0%
um not speaking about the uh how to
 
06:52:06.288 --> 06:52:06.298 align:start position:0%
incorporate this but about the rec
 
06:52:06.298 --> 06:52:08.090 align:start position:0%
incorporate this but about the rec
Market

06:52:08.090 --> 06:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
Market
 
06:52:09.948 --> 06:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
um of course whenever you mess with any
 
06:52:11.448 --> 06:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
what have you come involved in any
 
06:52:13.368 --> 06:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
Market there's potential things don't
 
06:52:15.230 --> 06:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
work the way you want
 
06:52:17.330 --> 06:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
um have you considered the possibility
 
06:52:19.610 --> 06:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
of putting more wrecks into the market
 
06:52:22.368 --> 06:52:22.378 align:start position:0%
May depress the existing Rec Market
 
06:52:25.850 --> 06:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
rather than making more available
 
06:52:27.530 --> 06:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:52:29.150 --> 06:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
um as you mentioned right it's a it's a
 
06:52:30.530 --> 06:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
dynamic Market
 
06:52:33.230 --> 06:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
um the market uh dictates what the price
 
06:52:34.788 --> 06:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
what the trading price of those wrecks
 
06:52:36.230 --> 06:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
are and where they settle depending on
 
06:52:37.670 --> 06:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
the policies of both New Hampshire as
 
06:52:39.708 --> 06:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
well as other states
 
06:52:42.230 --> 06:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
um given the track record that we have
 
06:52:42.240 --> 06:52:43.190 align:start position:0%
um given the track record that we have
seen

06:52:43.190 --> 06:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
seen
 
06:52:45.468 --> 06:52:45.478 align:start position:0%
um with alternative compliance payments
 
06:52:48.048 --> 06:52:48.058 align:start position:0%
made by Electric distribution utilities
 
06:52:50.570 --> 06:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
as well as a competitive supplier uh we
 
06:52:52.270 --> 06:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
have seen that
 
06:52:52.280 --> 06:52:54.310 align:start position:0%
have seen that
more

06:52:54.310 --> 06:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:52:56.868 --> 06:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments are
 
06:52:58.368 --> 06:52:58.378 align:start position:0%
being made disproportionately for
 
06:53:00.968 --> 06:53:00.978 align:start position:0%
thermal racks which indicates either
 
06:53:03.770 --> 06:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
that they aren't available or if they
 
06:53:05.708 --> 06:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
are available they are
 
06:53:07.968 --> 06:53:07.978 align:start position:0%
settling in other states where the
 
06:53:09.770 --> 06:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payment is lower
 
06:53:11.510 --> 06:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
so it makes more sense from a financial
 
06:53:14.510 --> 06:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
basis that the company say if saves a
 
06:53:15.948 --> 06:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
large company decides okay we're going
 
06:53:17.690 --> 06:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
to settle these in another jurisdiction
 
06:53:19.250 --> 06:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'm making up States let's just say
 
06:53:19.260 --> 06:53:20.930 align:start position:0%
I'm making up States let's just say
Massachusetts

06:53:20.930 --> 06:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
06:53:22.490 --> 06:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
um you know they may have to pay an ACP
 
06:53:25.250 --> 06:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
of 80 again making up numbers versus New
 
06:53:29.150 --> 06:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it would be 65 and change
 
06:53:30.770 --> 06:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
that it makes more financial sense for
 
06:53:31.968 --> 06:53:31.978 align:start position:0%
them to settle them somewhere else and
 
06:53:33.650 --> 06:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
just make the payments here for a number
 
06:53:35.270 --> 06:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
of the smaller competitive suppliers
 
06:53:36.948 --> 06:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
sometimes they just don't have the
 
06:53:38.150 --> 06:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
volume that it doesn't make sense for
 
06:53:39.830 --> 06:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
them to go out to actually procure the
 
06:53:40.910 --> 06:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
racks themselves so they'll make
 
06:53:42.948 --> 06:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments but if
 
06:53:44.270 --> 06:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
you look at our annual report it's
 
06:53:48.170 --> 06:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
pretty much across the board okay
 
06:53:50.510 --> 06:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
got it right here in front of me
 
06:53:52.368 --> 06:53:52.378 align:start position:0%
um yeah all with the exception of
 
06:53:55.128 --> 06:53:55.138 align:start position:0%
Liberty all the major utilities
 
06:53:55.138 --> 06:53:55.788 align:start position:0%
Liberty all the major utilities
um

06:53:55.788 --> 06:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:57.830 --> 06:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that's the the co-op eversourcing
 
06:54:01.628 --> 06:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
Unitil all made class one thermal acps
 
06:54:04.610 --> 06:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
as well as pretty much most of the
 
06:54:05.990 --> 06:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers there's a couple
 
06:54:07.850 --> 06:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
here that didn't but I suspect that they
 
06:54:07.860 --> 06:54:09.170 align:start position:0%
here that didn't but I suspect that they
probably

06:54:09.170 --> 06:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
probably
 
06:54:09.180 --> 06:54:10.548 align:start position:0%
probably
um

06:54:10.548 --> 06:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:13.190 --> 06:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh either we're able to
 
06:54:14.868 --> 06:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
from a national basis they were able to
 
06:54:16.788 --> 06:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
sort of Cobble them together
 
06:54:18.590 --> 06:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for that excellent answer
 
06:54:20.990 --> 06:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
you're very welcome thank you uh we'll
 
06:54:22.430 --> 06:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
move on thank you so much for your
 
06:54:24.530 --> 06:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
testimony always a pleasure to have you
 
06:54:26.628 --> 06:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
Michelle yet thank you very much Mr Vice
 
06:54:28.310 --> 06:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
chair I know I'm pale invitation to Mr
 
06:54:31.368 --> 06:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
Roberts but I try my best
 
06:54:34.310 --> 06:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on Mr Michael Licata
 
06:54:41.750 --> 06:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:41.760 --> 06:54:45.128 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:54:45.128 --> 06:54:45.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:47.810 --> 06:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
Michael Licata representing eversource
 
06:54:51.770 --> 06:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
also a pale imitation of Mr Roberge
 
06:54:51.780 --> 06:54:52.430 align:start position:0%
also a pale imitation of Mr Roberge
um

06:54:52.430 --> 06:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:55.368 --> 06:54:55.378 align:start position:0%
happy to testify this afternoon in
 
06:54:57.968 --> 06:54:57.978 align:start position:0%
support of HB
 
06:55:01.128 --> 06:55:01.138 align:start position:0%
233 as you've heard from previous
 
06:55:01.138 --> 06:55:02.770 align:start position:0%
233 as you've heard from previous
testifiers

06:55:02.770 --> 06:55:02.780 align:start position:0%
testifiers
 
06:55:06.048 --> 06:55:06.058 align:start position:0%
the bill aims to address a metering
 
06:55:08.868 --> 06:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
issue that we believe has really held
 
06:55:10.910 --> 06:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
back a number of thermal sources from
 
06:55:13.250 --> 06:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
being able to participate in the class
 
06:55:15.788 --> 06:55:15.798 align:start position:0%
one thermal carve out of the RPS
 
06:55:18.048 --> 06:55:18.058 align:start position:0%
generating more wrecks as the bill
 
06:55:21.230 --> 06:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor said will reduce the utilities
 
06:55:23.390 --> 06:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
need to make alternative compliance
 
06:55:25.548 --> 06:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
payments alternative compliance payments
 
06:55:26.930 --> 06:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
just by way of background are
 
06:55:29.090 --> 06:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
essentially the ceiling or the cap so
 
06:55:30.770 --> 06:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
that's the highest amount that the
 
06:55:33.708 --> 06:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
utility can pay so a wreck by its very
 
06:55:36.230 --> 06:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
nature if its purchase will be purchased
 
06:55:38.930 --> 06:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
less than that ceiling thereby reducing
 
06:55:43.490 --> 06:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
costs and as Mr Elliott testified to
 
06:55:46.610 --> 06:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh all the utilities as well as I should
 
06:55:48.170 --> 06:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
say most of the utilities as well as the
 
06:55:50.448 --> 06:55:50.458 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers uh did make
 
06:55:53.208 --> 06:55:53.218 align:start position:0%
significant ACP payments uh because of
 
06:55:55.128 --> 06:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
the lack of availability of wrecks
 
06:55:58.128 --> 06:55:58.138 align:start position:0%
eversource in the last compliance period
 
06:56:02.448 --> 06:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
2021 uh made payments uh of 1.2 million
 
06:56:04.250 --> 06:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
dollars just for our thermal wreck
 
06:56:07.070 --> 06:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
obligation for ACP so certainly anything
 
06:56:09.048 --> 06:56:09.058 align:start position:0%
we can do to increase that Supply not
 
06:56:11.868 --> 06:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
only reduces the cost of electricity but
 
06:56:14.030 --> 06:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
also provides a benefit to the
 
06:56:16.548 --> 06:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
individuals producing those wrecks so
 
06:56:19.430 --> 06:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
the financial incentive with that I'd be
 
06:56:21.468 --> 06:56:21.478 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that the
 
06:56:23.150 --> 06:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
06:56:26.330 --> 06:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
06:56:28.730 --> 06:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair
 
06:56:32.750 --> 06:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
um so you heard the doe propose
 
06:56:38.150 --> 06:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
potentially a large and small uh wreck
 
06:56:41.208 --> 06:56:41.218 align:start position:0%
concept here uh generator I do believe
 
06:56:42.590 --> 06:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
there are any
 
06:56:46.010 --> 06:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
um wood burning entities that are on the
 
06:56:49.010 --> 06:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
large-scale side that would benefit from
 
06:56:52.430 --> 06:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
a fix to the metering issue or are they
 
06:56:54.530 --> 06:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
all well captured with the current
 
06:56:56.090 --> 06:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
metering standard
 
06:56:58.788 --> 06:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll defer that to folks from the
 
06:57:00.948 --> 06:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
wood industry who can speak much better
 
06:57:03.350 --> 06:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
to the how they would comply with the
 
06:57:05.510 --> 06:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
metering issue I would say
 
06:57:07.788 --> 06:57:07.798 align:start position:0%
um I think this is in response to some
 
06:57:09.830 --> 06:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked the class one
 
06:57:13.430 --> 06:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
thermal is not wood alone it's solar
 
06:57:17.510 --> 06:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
thermal as well as geothermal and and
 
06:57:19.910 --> 06:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
biomass but there are I think someone
 
06:57:21.110 --> 06:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
had asked this question there are
 
06:57:23.330 --> 06:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
emissions requirements associated with
 
06:57:26.990 --> 06:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
the biomass which as the chair had said
 
06:57:29.990 --> 06:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsor uh really I believe and
 
06:57:31.430 --> 06:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
obviously others in the industry can
 
06:57:33.830 --> 06:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
speak to this as well confines it to
 
06:57:36.048 --> 06:57:36.058 align:start position:0%
pellets wood pellets in order to meet
 
06:57:38.330 --> 06:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
those emission standards so very long
 
06:57:40.070 --> 06:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
way of of saying I think there are
 
06:57:41.570 --> 06:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
others behind me who could answer that
 
06:57:43.490 --> 06:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
question more much better than I could
 
06:57:46.250 --> 06:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:57:48.530 --> 06:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
representative munz
 
06:57:50.810 --> 06:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:57:53.510 --> 06:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you have any idea
 
06:57:56.868 --> 06:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
how many additional wrecks this metering
 
06:57:59.990 --> 06:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
would or this this would generate I I
 
06:58:02.510 --> 06:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't again folks within the industry
 
06:58:04.610 --> 06:58:04.620 align:start position:0%
who work with the individuals who are
 
06:58:06.410 --> 06:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
installing these these pellet boilers
 
06:58:08.570 --> 06:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
would have a much better better idea of
 
06:58:10.628 --> 06:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
that again for the utility
 
06:58:12.948 --> 06:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
excuse me from the utility standpoint
 
06:58:16.310 --> 06:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
you know we just see what's available uh
 
06:58:18.110 --> 06:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
that complies with the RPS that's been
 
06:58:18.120 --> 06:58:19.150 align:start position:0%
that complies with the RPS that's been
certified

06:58:19.150 --> 06:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
certified
 
06:58:21.590 --> 06:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
to generate the wreck we don't really
 
06:58:23.690 --> 06:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
have insight into what the the industry
 
06:58:26.390 --> 06:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
is doing on the other end of that
 
06:58:28.968 --> 06:58:28.978 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:58:30.830 --> 06:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you Mr
 
06:58:33.590 --> 06:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
locata oh sorry
 
06:58:36.590 --> 06:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
for episode Wendy Thomas thank you um I
 
06:58:39.110 --> 06:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
just have a a general question
 
06:58:42.110 --> 06:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
um our environmental impact is that
 
06:58:45.830 --> 06:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
considered when um you give out wrecks
 
06:58:49.070 --> 06:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
like this or is I I mean sure I don't
 
06:58:50.810 --> 06:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
know I mean that's sure
 
06:58:54.170 --> 06:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
um so the types of technologies that
 
06:58:57.350 --> 06:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
qualify for the state RPS are specified
 
06:59:01.548 --> 06:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
in State Statute most of them don't have
 
06:59:04.368 --> 06:59:04.378 align:start position:0%
emissions profiles so whether it's Hydro
 
06:59:07.968 --> 06:59:07.978 align:start position:0%
or solar or wind when it comes to
 
06:59:10.250 --> 06:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
biomass which does have an emissions
 
06:59:12.048 --> 06:59:12.058 align:start position:0%
profile there's actually a rather
 
06:59:12.058 --> 06:59:13.968 align:start position:0%
profile there's actually a rather
elaborate

06:59:13.968 --> 06:59:13.978 align:start position:0%
elaborate
 
06:59:13.978 --> 06:59:14.868 align:start position:0%
elaborate
um

06:59:14.868 --> 06:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:17.510 --> 06:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
I think the Des might have last left but
 
06:59:19.548 --> 06:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
elaborate emission standard that they
 
06:59:21.590 --> 06:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
have to comply with in order to qualify
 
06:59:23.990 --> 06:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
for generating wrecks it's a different
 
06:59:26.750 --> 06:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
standard for for thermal wrecks
 
06:59:28.850 --> 06:59:28.860 align:start position:0%
um but there is a standard so
 
06:59:30.410 --> 06:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
essentially the state of New Hampshire
 
06:59:33.110 --> 06:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
has made a public policy decision of the
 
06:59:35.930 --> 06:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
emissions profile the environmental
 
06:59:38.270 --> 06:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
profile of the technology that can
 
06:59:40.190 --> 06:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
generate a wreck in New Hampshire okay
 
06:59:41.990 --> 06:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:59:44.510 --> 06:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
and with that thank you Mr Lakota thanks
 
06:59:46.670 --> 06:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
for your testimony right now I'm going
 
06:59:49.390 --> 06:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
to ask a question to Mr Sam Evans Brown
 
06:59:52.690 --> 06:59:52.700 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
06:59:55.430 --> 06:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's been reference to wanting to
 
06:59:57.948 --> 06:59:57.958 align:start position:0%
hear people from the wood industry would
 
07:00:00.170 --> 07:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
you care if uh is is he part of your
 
07:00:02.510 --> 07:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
testimony because I only have one card
 
07:00:02.520 --> 07:00:03.590 align:start position:0%
testimony because I only have one card
for

07:00:03.590 --> 07:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:00:07.570 --> 07:00:07.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:09.830 --> 07:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
who represent
 
07:00:14.390 --> 07:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:16.610 --> 07:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
okay I I'll bring some wood people up
 
07:00:18.948 --> 07:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
first and then you can go go next time
 
07:00:21.708 --> 07:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
so um I'm not sure which order this is
 
07:00:26.090 --> 07:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:28.010 --> 07:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
and I've been kind of waiting to see Mr
 
07:00:29.750 --> 07:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
Nichols come up here because you come
 
07:00:33.770 --> 07:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:36.350 --> 07:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
I used to live up on Dame Hill very
 
07:00:36.360 --> 07:00:37.730 align:start position:0%
I used to live up on Dame Hill very
close

07:00:37.730 --> 07:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
close
 
07:00:39.410 --> 07:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman and members
 
07:00:41.030 --> 07:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Scott
 
07:00:43.190 --> 07:00:43.200 align:start position:0%

07:00:46.850 --> 07:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
we import and distribute uh wood wood
 
07:00:49.490 --> 07:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
pellet and wood chip boilers around the
 
07:00:49.500 --> 07:00:51.048 align:start position:0%
pellet and wood chip boilers around the
country

07:00:51.048 --> 07:00:51.058 align:start position:0%
country
 
07:00:53.390 --> 07:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
and I've been in this industry a long
 
07:00:55.368 --> 07:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
time I've seen many of you in this room
 
07:00:57.850 --> 07:00:57.860 align:start position:0%
or a room like it before
 
07:01:03.430 --> 07:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
I am also a individual seller of T-Rex
 
07:01:06.468 --> 07:01:06.478 align:start position:0%
in a building that I own that I run my
 
07:01:08.990 --> 07:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
business from so I kind of come at this
 
07:01:11.690 --> 07:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
from many different uh levels
 
07:01:15.048 --> 07:01:15.058 align:start position:0%
uh I am here to support
 
07:01:17.570 --> 07:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
um the bill is introduced
 
07:01:20.270 --> 07:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
um for going back about 10 years ago
 
07:01:22.690 --> 07:01:22.700 align:start position:0%
working with then the puc
 
07:01:25.730 --> 07:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
this was a big question how do we how do
 
07:01:29.628 --> 07:01:29.638 align:start position:0%
we get residential uh pellet boilers at
 
07:01:31.070 --> 07:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
that time
 
07:01:33.708 --> 07:01:33.718 align:start position:0%
um to be part of the t-rec program and
 
07:01:36.830 --> 07:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
the the cost of metering
 
07:01:39.788 --> 07:01:39.798 align:start position:0%
those spoilers made it uh difficult
 
07:01:44.090 --> 07:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
prohibitive and that's why I think
 
07:01:46.850 --> 07:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
um we've settled at this point to just
 
07:01:50.150 --> 07:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
having T-Rex for uh uh commercial
 
07:01:53.208 --> 07:01:53.218 align:start position:0%
boilers um this the smaller boilers just
 
07:01:55.968 --> 07:01:55.978 align:start position:0%
don't produce enough T-Rex to justify
 
07:01:58.670 --> 07:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of metering and verifying the
 
07:02:02.448 --> 07:02:02.458 align:start position:0%
output of the meter uh so this I feel uh
 
07:02:05.570 --> 07:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
by loosening this standard for the
 
07:02:08.990 --> 07:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
smaller boilers uh perhaps allowing uh
 
07:02:11.090 --> 07:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
T-Rex to be created on the basis of
 
07:02:13.850 --> 07:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
metered wood uh in the case of wood
 
07:02:16.430 --> 07:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
pellets uh through certified scales of
 
07:02:18.650 --> 07:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
the trucks that deliver the wood perhaps
 
07:02:20.810 --> 07:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
receipts from the stores where tons of
 
07:02:23.810 --> 07:02:23.820 align:start position:0%
pellets are purchased I think there's a
 
07:02:26.230 --> 07:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
way to verify that pellets are being
 
07:02:30.650 --> 07:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
consumed perhaps with a some sort of
 
07:02:33.468 --> 07:02:33.478 align:start position:0%
minimum efficiency and some sort of
 
07:02:36.350 --> 07:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
minimum emissions criteria I think it's
 
07:02:38.330 --> 07:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
totally possible and we've discussed
 
07:02:40.010 --> 07:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
this for many years in the industry
 
07:02:42.890 --> 07:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
again with the puc
 
07:02:42.900 --> 07:02:45.170 align:start position:0%
again with the puc
um

07:02:45.170 --> 07:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:47.270 --> 07:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh someone asked
 
07:02:49.968 --> 07:02:49.978 align:start position:0%
how many T-Rexes would create
 
07:02:52.670 --> 07:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a great question but
 
07:02:54.830 --> 07:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a difficult one because
 
07:02:57.170 --> 07:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
there are so many other factors that
 
07:02:59.628 --> 07:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
influence how many new
 
07:03:01.788 --> 07:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
pellet burning wood chip burning wood
 
07:03:04.670 --> 07:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
burning equipment uh or appliances enter
 
07:03:06.590 --> 07:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
the market each year and one of the
 
07:03:08.990 --> 07:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
biggest factors is the cost of oil or
 
07:03:12.170 --> 07:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
gas the Alternatives and more and more
 
07:03:14.390 --> 07:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
of the cost of power I think a lot of
 
07:03:17.090 --> 07:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
people have put heat pumps in with a
 
07:03:18.708 --> 07:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
promise that it's going to be very
 
07:03:20.208 --> 07:03:20.218 align:start position:0%
inexpensive and for sure it's less
 
07:03:22.070 --> 07:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
expensive than oil and gas but now we've
 
07:03:23.750 --> 07:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
seen power prices increase in quite a
 
07:03:23.760 --> 07:03:24.468 align:start position:0%
seen power prices increase in quite a
bit

07:03:24.468 --> 07:03:24.478 align:start position:0%
bit
 
07:03:27.350 --> 07:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
so what we're we're basically in a
 
07:03:29.810 --> 07:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
period of energy turmoil I think and I
 
07:03:31.190 --> 07:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be this way for a
 
07:03:34.128 --> 07:03:34.138 align:start position:0%
while because it's confusing for bankers
 
07:03:36.468 --> 07:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
and investors to know what to put their
 
07:03:37.610 --> 07:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
money into
 
07:03:39.708 --> 07:03:39.718 align:start position:0%
they're nervous about investing in in
 
07:03:42.410 --> 07:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
future oil uh and gas exploration and
 
07:03:43.730 --> 07:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
development they're nervous about
 
07:03:46.490 --> 07:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
Refinery growth and so we're going to
 
07:03:49.250 --> 07:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
we're we're basically through policy to
 
07:03:51.170 --> 07:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of Renewables
 
07:03:52.968 --> 07:03:52.978 align:start position:0%
available to everyone we're in a period
 
07:03:55.670 --> 07:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
of turmoil and one thing that's not in
 
07:03:59.270 --> 07:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
turmoil in New Hampshire is wood supply
 
07:04:02.510 --> 07:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
our industry can help
 
07:04:04.610 --> 07:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
we're not going to help everybody but we
 
07:04:06.708 --> 07:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
can take a significant amount of stress
 
07:04:08.990 --> 07:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
off of heating bills and the
 
07:04:11.090 --> 07:04:11.100 align:start position:0%
availability of heating fuels and if we
 
07:04:12.770 --> 07:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
can encourage people
 
07:04:17.390 --> 07:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
to buy what I sell and other products
 
07:04:20.390 --> 07:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
like them I I think we can we can help
 
07:04:22.548 --> 07:04:22.558 align:start position:0%
out the state by keeping more fuel
 
07:04:25.128 --> 07:04:25.138 align:start position:0%
dollars here we can help out the utility
 
07:04:27.350 --> 07:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
and and we can just take a load off the
 
07:04:29.150 --> 07:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
grid all in all
 
07:04:31.730 --> 07:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
personally speaking I I use about 35
 
07:04:34.750 --> 07:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
tons of wood pellets a year
 
07:04:38.930 --> 07:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
T-Rex pay me back uh somewhere between
 
07:04:42.410 --> 07:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
2500 and 3 000 for the purchase of those
 
07:04:45.708 --> 07:04:45.718 align:start position:0%
pellets so it's a significant uh
 
07:04:47.868 --> 07:04:47.878 align:start position:0%
encouragement inducement to to continue
 
07:04:51.350 --> 07:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
to burn wood pellets so if we want to
 
07:04:53.330 --> 07:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
burn wood in this state if we believe in
 
07:04:56.208 --> 07:04:56.218 align:start position:0%
our our own uh renewable resource I
 
07:04:59.990 --> 07:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:02.030 --> 07:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll conclude with that if you take
 
07:05:04.788 --> 07:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much
 
07:05:07.368 --> 07:05:07.378 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
07:05:08.930 --> 07:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Vice chair take up my question
 
07:05:12.230 --> 07:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you for uh being here today
 
07:05:15.468 --> 07:05:15.478 align:start position:0%
um I could give you an idea of these
 
07:05:17.330 --> 07:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
meters uh now you're in a commercial
 
07:05:19.250 --> 07:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
operation obviously
 
07:05:21.890 --> 07:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
that's how I sell mine yes but if I
 
07:05:25.250 --> 07:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
talking about a residential operation in
 
07:05:27.708 --> 07:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
order to sell Rex I need to purchase a
 
07:05:30.948 --> 07:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
meter in order to uh
 
07:05:33.830 --> 07:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
see the BTUs that I'm producing
 
07:05:36.110 --> 07:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
could you give me a rough Ballpark and I
 
07:05:37.310 --> 07:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
sure won't hold you to it but a rough
 
07:05:39.530 --> 07:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
ballpark of what the cost of one of
 
07:05:41.810 --> 07:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
those meters would be costs about five
 
07:05:43.610 --> 07:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to purchase and install
 
07:05:46.310 --> 07:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
a meter that's why you don't see them at
 
07:05:50.030 --> 07:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
residential installations thank you
 
07:05:50.040 --> 07:05:51.590 align:start position:0%
residential installations thank you
we're

07:05:51.590 --> 07:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
we're
 
07:05:55.208 --> 07:05:55.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:59.270 --> 07:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
so obviously I I used to be on resources
 
07:06:01.368 --> 07:06:01.378 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of my questions are
 
07:06:04.430 --> 07:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
environmental if we open this up
 
07:06:05.810 --> 07:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
um to
 
07:06:08.750 --> 07:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
everybody getting thermoorex are we
 
07:06:11.150 --> 07:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
going to I mean um the the sponsor of
 
07:06:12.350 --> 07:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
the bills said that you know in the
 
07:06:14.030 --> 07:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
olden days you didn't see many trees
 
07:06:16.190 --> 07:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
because we burned them all are we going
 
07:06:19.010 --> 07:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
to go back to that
 
07:06:21.350 --> 07:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
I seriously doubt that we could ever go
 
07:06:23.690 --> 07:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
back to that
 
07:06:26.810 --> 07:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
nobody goes into the woods to cut trees
 
07:06:29.628 --> 07:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
for fuel there's no value in those trees
 
07:06:31.788 --> 07:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
for fuel if they're worth basically
 
07:06:31.798 --> 07:06:32.810 align:start position:0%
for fuel if they're worth basically
nothing

07:06:32.810 --> 07:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
07:06:35.208 --> 07:06:35.218 align:start position:0%
and so you can't you can't charge enough
 
07:06:38.330 --> 07:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
to harvest them so the wood that that
 
07:06:41.090 --> 07:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
we're burning for fuel is residual to
 
07:06:45.010 --> 07:06:45.020 align:start position:0%
the main Harvest which is for lumber
 
07:06:48.110 --> 07:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
and the problem that we have is not that
 
07:06:50.150 --> 07:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
we're cutting too many trees the problem
 
07:06:52.570 --> 07:06:52.580 align:start position:0%
that we're beginning to see is that
 
07:06:54.650 --> 07:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
forests are under pressure to be
 
07:06:56.868 --> 07:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
hydrated which means that people go in
 
07:06:58.788 --> 07:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
and take out the good trees
 
07:07:01.010 --> 07:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
the nice straight tall ones and they're
 
07:07:03.288 --> 07:07:03.298 align:start position:0%
leaving all the junk
 
07:07:06.048 --> 07:07:06.058 align:start position:0%
um that basically is crowded and and
 
07:07:08.208 --> 07:07:08.218 align:start position:0%
worthless and diseased
 
07:07:08.218 --> 07:07:09.650 align:start position:0%
worthless and diseased
and

07:07:09.650 --> 07:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:07:12.350 --> 07:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
um with climate change and with
 
07:07:14.150 --> 07:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
increasing number of pests thinking
 
07:07:16.788 --> 07:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
about the emerald ash borer we actually
 
07:07:19.430 --> 07:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
are under some pressure to have more
 
07:07:22.430 --> 07:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
means for getting rid of this wood and
 
07:07:24.288 --> 07:07:24.298 align:start position:0%
making our forests more resilient and
 
07:07:27.070 --> 07:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
healthy so I believe that by creating
 
07:07:29.990 --> 07:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
stronger consistent markets for wood I
 
07:07:32.690 --> 07:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
think we do a benefit to our forests
 
07:07:35.628 --> 07:07:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:39.110 --> 07:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:41.448 --> 07:07:41.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I'm your neighbor
 
07:07:44.270 --> 07:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
right down the road I'm from Lebanon
 
07:07:45.890 --> 07:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering is there some
 
07:07:47.810 --> 07:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
sort of resale market for pellets I'm
 
07:07:50.448 --> 07:07:50.458 align:start position:0%
just thinking imagine I buy a lot of
 
07:07:50.458 --> 07:07:51.350 align:start position:0%
just thinking imagine I buy a lot of
pellets

07:07:51.350 --> 07:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
pellets
 
07:07:54.410 --> 07:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
get the Rex and then sell them a little
 
07:07:57.230 --> 07:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
bit you know to my neighbors but I keep
 
07:08:00.110 --> 07:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
the wrecks and and then they can't I
 
07:08:01.610 --> 07:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
mean is that a scenario that could
 
07:08:01.620 --> 07:08:03.170 align:start position:0%
mean is that a scenario that could
happen

07:08:03.170 --> 07:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
happen
 
07:08:05.448 --> 07:08:05.458 align:start position:0%
I suppose it could happen but it seems
 
07:08:06.708 --> 07:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
07:08:10.010 --> 07:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh economically silly uh maybe I'm not
 
07:08:11.868 --> 07:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
seeing the whole picture but if
 
07:08:13.910 --> 07:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
anybody's buying pellets
 
07:08:16.730 --> 07:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
uh they're they're they're paying some
 
07:08:18.948 --> 07:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
rate right and so I'm not sure what
 
07:08:20.690 --> 07:08:20.700 align:start position:0%
benefit there is for them to keep the
 
07:08:20.700 --> 07:08:21.708 align:start position:0%
benefit there is for them to keep the
wrecks

07:08:21.708 --> 07:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
07:08:22.990 --> 07:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
and and
 
07:08:25.850 --> 07:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
sell them in in the neighbor down the
 
07:08:27.650 --> 07:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
street doesn't get the rexes somehow it
 
07:08:30.230 --> 07:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
the economics don't work out
 
07:08:33.468 --> 07:08:33.478 align:start position:0%
um I I some pellets are sold for animal
 
07:08:33.478 --> 07:08:35.448 align:start position:0%
um I I some pellets are sold for animal
betting

07:08:35.448 --> 07:08:35.458 align:start position:0%
betting
 
07:08:38.150 --> 07:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
um but that I think that's really rare
 
07:08:39.890 --> 07:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
um they're expensive
 
07:08:41.810 --> 07:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
um so I don't see that being an issue I
 
07:08:43.548 --> 07:08:43.558 align:start position:0%
think we need some kind of verification
 
07:08:45.770 --> 07:08:45.780 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's
 
07:08:48.708 --> 07:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
you know you get your fuel your fuel uh
 
07:08:50.930 --> 07:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
your your your weight ticket from the
 
07:08:54.048 --> 07:08:54.058 align:start position:0%
delivery or your receipt from Home Depot
 
07:08:55.788 --> 07:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
or wherever the pellets are purchased
 
07:08:58.368 --> 07:08:58.378 align:start position:0%
and then maybe there's a maybe there's a
 
07:09:00.048 --> 07:09:00.058 align:start position:0%
side verification like the number of
 
07:09:01.910 --> 07:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
operating hours each year for the
 
07:09:04.128 --> 07:09:04.138 align:start position:0%
machine that somehow
 
07:09:06.890 --> 07:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
proves that or at least comes close to
 
07:09:08.690 --> 07:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
proving that that number of pellets was
 
07:09:10.850 --> 07:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
consumed I think it's possible to come
 
07:09:14.150 --> 07:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
up with something to verify
 
07:09:16.430 --> 07:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
I have one last question uh it was
 
07:09:18.890 --> 07:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh we've been told before that
 
07:09:20.930 --> 07:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
there's not that much you know high
 
07:09:25.430 --> 07:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
grade Lumber here in New Hampshire so uh
 
07:09:29.208 --> 07:09:29.218 align:start position:0%
when you say that you use wood from
 
07:09:29.218 --> 07:09:31.010 align:start position:0%
when you say that you use wood from
residual

07:09:31.010 --> 07:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
residual
 
07:09:31.020 --> 07:09:32.090 align:start position:0%
residual
um

07:09:32.090 --> 07:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:35.208 --> 07:09:35.218 align:start position:0%
operations that cut down
 
07:09:38.750 --> 07:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
wood for lumber uh I'm I'm curious what
 
07:09:40.310 --> 07:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
what type of
 
07:09:42.110 --> 07:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
how much of it do we have here and what
 
07:09:44.270 --> 07:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a market do we have uh because
 
07:09:46.430 --> 07:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
the two statements didn't seem to quite
 
07:09:49.190 --> 07:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
correlate so if you could kind of give
 
07:09:51.350 --> 07:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
us a picture on where we get that wood
 
07:09:51.360 --> 07:09:53.030 align:start position:0%
us a picture on where we get that wood
from

07:09:53.030 --> 07:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:09:55.010 --> 07:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
I will explain it to you in the simplest
 
07:09:56.990 --> 07:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
terms that I have and I've learned it
 
07:09:59.090 --> 07:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
from my friend and colleague behind me
 
07:10:00.890 --> 07:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
Charlie nibling
 
07:10:03.830 --> 07:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
75 percent of our forests are low-grade
 
07:10:07.368 --> 07:10:07.378 align:start position:0%
wood 25 are high grade approximately
 
07:10:09.708 --> 07:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
but 75 percent of the value is in that
 
07:10:11.750 --> 07:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
25 percent of high grade
 
07:10:14.628 --> 07:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
and the 25 or maybe even lower now is in
 
07:10:16.190 --> 07:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
in the low grade wood so it's not that
 
07:10:18.530 --> 07:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
we don't have high grade wood it's just
 
07:10:21.048 --> 07:10:21.058 align:start position:0%
that when a harvest is made
 
07:10:24.410 --> 07:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
the there is a huge volume
 
07:10:27.948 --> 07:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
that is that is not very valuable and a
 
07:10:30.288 --> 07:10:30.298 align:start position:0%
small volume that is but in order to
 
07:10:33.530 --> 07:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
have a healthy Forest after a logging
 
07:10:35.030 --> 07:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
cut is done
 
07:10:37.070 --> 07:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
that low-grade wood has to be taken too
 
07:10:39.590 --> 07:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
or else all that's left is the low grade
 
07:10:39.600 --> 07:10:40.850 align:start position:0%
or else all that's left is the low grade
so

07:10:40.850 --> 07:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:10:45.170 --> 07:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
um part of good stewardship is is taking
 
07:10:47.990 --> 07:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
some of all of it and leaving some and
 
07:10:49.910 --> 07:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
providing proper spacing and species
 
07:10:52.490 --> 07:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
that are going to flourish
 
07:10:54.948 --> 07:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent explanation
 
07:10:58.010 --> 07:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for that excuse me
 
07:11:00.530 --> 07:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
see no other questions thank you so much
 
07:11:03.230 --> 07:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate you coming here
 
07:11:08.330 --> 07:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on a Morton Bailey
 
07:11:11.930 --> 07:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
from lime green Heat
 
07:11:14.208 --> 07:11:14.218 align:start position:0%
from lime
 
07:11:17.990 --> 07:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah another stomping ground of mine
 
07:11:20.510 --> 07:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you all for having me here um so
 
07:11:23.628 --> 07:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh lime green Heats a uh what I call a
 
07:11:26.390 --> 07:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
wood pellet fuel company so we do uh
 
07:11:28.430 --> 07:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
Sales and Service of fully automated
 
07:11:31.788 --> 07:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
wood pellet boilers and furnaces and we
 
07:11:33.830 --> 07:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
deliver bulk wood pellets
 
07:11:35.690 --> 07:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
um so our fuel delivery companies just
 
07:11:38.270 --> 07:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
like an oil or propane company so we
 
07:11:41.150 --> 07:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
drive a tank truck to somebody's home a
 
07:11:43.430 --> 07:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
hook a hose up to a storage bin that's
 
07:11:46.430 --> 07:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
in their basement or a silo outside at a
 
07:11:49.548 --> 07:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
business or municipality and we blow
 
07:11:51.288 --> 07:11:51.298 align:start position:0%
those wood pellets in just like an oil
 
07:11:53.810 --> 07:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
delivery is pumped into your tank
 
07:11:55.968 --> 07:11:55.978 align:start position:0%
um so our boilers that we work with are
 
07:11:58.010 --> 07:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
a little more sophisticated
 
07:12:00.770 --> 07:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
um meeting uh the the EPA standards for
 
07:12:03.350 --> 07:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency and our products that are
 
07:12:05.090 --> 07:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
rebated through the department of
 
07:12:07.788 --> 07:12:07.798 align:start position:0%
Energy's sustainable energy rebate
 
07:12:07.798 --> 07:12:09.170 align:start position:0%
Energy's sustainable energy rebate
programs

07:12:09.170 --> 07:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
programs
 
07:12:11.810 --> 07:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
um so from our perspective in support of
 
07:12:15.288 --> 07:12:15.298 align:start position:0%
this bill we can see the ability to show
 
07:12:17.570 --> 07:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
a metered amount of fuel that goes to
 
07:12:19.448 --> 07:12:19.458 align:start position:0%
each one of the these systems annually
 
07:12:22.190 --> 07:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
along with that we do service of these
 
07:12:24.590 --> 07:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
systems so as Scott mentioned we can
 
07:12:26.570 --> 07:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
track that the service hours the
 
07:12:29.208 --> 07:12:29.218 align:start position:0%
operational hours of the burner so that
 
07:12:32.750 --> 07:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
gives us that that two-stage system of
 
07:12:35.090 --> 07:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
verifying the fuel that's burned through
 
07:12:37.070 --> 07:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
the operational hours of the appliance
 
07:12:39.708 --> 07:12:39.718 align:start position:0%
the other benefit we have is servicing
 
07:12:41.570 --> 07:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
that Appliance annually just like you
 
07:12:44.570 --> 07:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
have your gas or oil boiler service so
 
07:12:46.670 --> 07:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
again we can help to kind of verify the
 
07:12:48.890 --> 07:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
efficiency in the operational status of
 
07:12:51.410 --> 07:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
that piece of equipment so we look at
 
07:12:53.990 --> 07:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
this you know our industry the thing
 
07:12:56.090 --> 07:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
that kind of turns us on about it is
 
07:12:59.570 --> 07:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
getting truly hyper local energy so we
 
07:13:01.368 --> 07:13:01.378 align:start position:0%
know that our wood is coming you know
 
07:13:03.288 --> 07:13:03.298 align:start position:0%
from within the state or communities
 
07:13:06.350 --> 07:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
State communities around it and are
 
07:13:08.628 --> 07:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
going directly to offset Oil and Propane
 
07:13:10.910 --> 07:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
consumption here in the state and
 
07:13:12.830 --> 07:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
building jobs and putting money back
 
07:13:15.530 --> 07:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
into the into the economy through that
 
07:13:17.448 --> 07:13:17.458 align:start position:0%
um so we just see a lot of benefits for
 
07:13:21.110 --> 07:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
the state having this really a an energy
 
07:13:23.990 --> 07:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
creation from our Forest Products
 
07:13:26.570 --> 07:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
um so the the ability to have these
 
07:13:28.788 --> 07:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
thermal wrecks enter in the market it's
 
07:13:30.048 --> 07:13:30.058 align:start position:0%
just going to help incentivize
 
07:13:30.058 --> 07:13:31.670 align:start position:0%
just going to help incentivize
homeowners

07:13:31.670 --> 07:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
07:13:33.890 --> 07:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
um small building owners to start to
 
07:13:36.288 --> 07:13:36.298 align:start position:0%
make that move to New Hampshire made or
 
07:13:38.930 --> 07:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
Vermont made or man-made fuel here
 
07:13:40.610 --> 07:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
um so it's really keeping that Regional
 
07:13:40.620 --> 07:13:41.690 align:start position:0%
um so it's really keeping that Regional
energy

07:13:41.690 --> 07:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
energy
 
07:13:43.310 --> 07:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
um here in the state
 
07:13:45.890 --> 07:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
um and I think we've you know there are
 
07:13:47.628 --> 07:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
totally some reasonable questions here
 
07:13:49.010 --> 07:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
on how that's all going to be done
 
07:13:50.690 --> 07:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
across the board when it comes to
 
07:13:53.270 --> 07:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
different wood heating appliances
 
07:13:55.430 --> 07:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
um I think one thing to keep it in mind
 
07:13:56.690 --> 07:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
as well
 
07:13:58.850 --> 07:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
is that there's already some some
 
07:14:01.430 --> 07:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
statutes built in so you know older
 
07:14:03.650 --> 07:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
appliances wouldn't qualify
 
07:14:05.208 --> 07:14:05.218 align:start position:0%
um so even if you were a large school
 
07:14:07.010 --> 07:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
right now if you'd put in a woodchuck
 
07:14:09.288 --> 07:14:09.298 align:start position:0%
boiler uh X number of years ago you
 
07:14:11.570 --> 07:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
wouldn't qualify to sell thermal Rex so
 
07:14:13.070 --> 07:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
I think that can kind of help to clean
 
07:14:14.930 --> 07:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
up a little bit of that going backwards
 
07:14:17.270 --> 07:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
on older systems too
 
07:14:18.830 --> 07:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and I think
 
07:14:20.930 --> 07:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
this is going to go back to help build
 
07:14:23.448 --> 07:14:23.458 align:start position:0%
that reserve of money to go towards
 
07:14:25.788 --> 07:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
these rebate programs that the the
 
07:14:28.190 --> 07:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
department of energy runs now so by
 
07:14:29.750 --> 07:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
having more wrecks go out into the
 
07:14:31.850 --> 07:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
market it in turn is going to feed back
 
07:14:34.610 --> 07:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
in to these rebate programs
 
07:14:36.230 --> 07:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
um you know which is converting you know
 
07:14:38.330 --> 07:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
residential and Commercial systems over
 
07:14:40.190 --> 07:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
to wood pellets and wood chips here in
 
07:14:41.208 --> 07:14:41.218 align:start position:0%
the state
 
07:14:45.310 --> 07:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
um so yeah glad to answer any questions
 
07:14:47.570 --> 07:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative's daughter
 
07:14:50.628 --> 07:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm just curious how many wood
 
07:14:53.448 --> 07:14:53.458 align:start position:0%
pellets could you fit in this room in
 
07:14:55.850 --> 07:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
this room that's a great question
 
07:14:58.010 --> 07:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
um so you would probably fit uh
 
07:15:01.128 --> 07:15:01.138 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the area of 30 tons in this
 
07:15:01.138 --> 07:15:04.190 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the area of 30 tons in this
space

07:15:04.190 --> 07:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:07.128 --> 07:15:07.138 align:start position:0%
sure representative Bernardi sorry I
 
07:15:08.690 --> 07:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
could do the cubic footage and figure it
 
07:15:10.310 --> 07:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
out for you do you have a weight
 
07:15:10.320 --> 07:15:12.230 align:start position:0%
out for you do you have a weight
question

07:15:12.230 --> 07:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:15:13.750 --> 07:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
a weight question
 
07:15:16.788 --> 07:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair
 
07:15:19.968 --> 07:15:19.978 align:start position:0%
um so you said uh you don't believe that
 
07:15:23.448 --> 07:15:23.458 align:start position:0%
uh older uh units that may have been put
 
07:15:25.250 --> 07:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
in schools before or whatever would
 
07:15:27.770 --> 07:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
qualify why do you say that why do you
 
07:15:29.930 --> 07:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
make that I think Charlie can can answer
 
07:15:32.868 --> 07:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
that but I believe there's a a date
 
07:15:36.350 --> 07:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
um you know prior to X year those
 
07:15:38.330 --> 07:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
systems weren't able to qualify for
 
07:15:40.310 --> 07:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
thermal Rex
 
07:15:43.548 --> 07:15:43.558 align:start position:0%
um it's not an environmental standard no
 
07:15:45.410 --> 07:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
exactly I think it was a standard that
 
07:15:49.548 --> 07:15:49.558 align:start position:0%
the the puc built into that thank you
 
07:15:51.468 --> 07:15:51.478 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
07:15:53.510 --> 07:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
07:15:55.490 --> 07:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
um you I'm this might have been a better
 
07:15:57.890 --> 07:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
question for the sponsor but knowing
 
07:15:59.930 --> 07:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts is not a lumber
 
07:16:01.910 --> 07:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
intensive State however Maine and
 
07:16:04.310 --> 07:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
Vermont are are you aware of programs
 
07:16:06.170 --> 07:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
like this in order to get down to this
 
07:16:08.030 --> 07:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
level are they possible in those States
 
07:16:10.430 --> 07:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
actually in Massachusetts
 
07:16:12.350 --> 07:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
um I I believe I think Maine is coming
 
07:16:14.690 --> 07:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
up with a program but Massachusetts has
 
07:16:17.150 --> 07:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
a program called aches another great
 
07:16:20.510 --> 07:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
acronym here which allows homeowners to
 
07:16:23.030 --> 07:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
sell thermal renewable energy credits in
 
07:16:25.128 --> 07:16:25.138 align:start position:0%
their state based off from delivered
 
07:16:28.788 --> 07:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:31.070 --> 07:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
07:16:33.590 --> 07:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative buns thank you very much
 
07:16:35.330 --> 07:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in
 
07:16:38.030 --> 07:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I'll ask I'll ask you the question I
 
07:16:39.948 --> 07:16:39.958 align:start position:0%
asked earlier do you have any idea how
 
07:16:42.048 --> 07:16:42.058 align:start position:0%
many additional wrecks this could
 
07:16:44.930 --> 07:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
generate in New Hampshire I I don't I
 
07:16:47.150 --> 07:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
have not uh I've not done that math okay
 
07:16:49.850 --> 07:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:51.468 --> 07:16:51.478 align:start position:0%
okay you see no other questions thank
 
07:16:53.868 --> 07:16:53.878 align:start position:0%
you so much very interesting thank you
 
07:16:54.948 --> 07:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
for coming
 
07:16:57.410 --> 07:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
and now we will get to Mr Charlie
 
07:17:00.110 --> 07:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
nibling who I'm sure will shed light on
 
07:17:04.850 --> 07:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:07.128 --> 07:17:07.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman
 
07:17:09.468 --> 07:17:09.478 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Vos and and
 
07:17:11.810 --> 07:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
other co-sponsors of of this legislation
 
07:17:13.490 --> 07:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm here
 
07:17:17.150 --> 07:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
as a long time advocate uh and supporter
 
07:17:19.190 --> 07:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the use the intelligent use of wood
 
07:17:20.750 --> 07:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
to make energy in the state of New
 
07:17:20.760 --> 07:17:21.650 align:start position:0%
to make energy in the state of New
Hampshire

07:17:21.650 --> 07:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
07:17:24.170 --> 07:17:24.180 align:start position:0%
with a particular focus on thermal
 
07:17:27.250 --> 07:17:27.260 align:start position:0%
energy over the course of my career
 
07:17:31.250 --> 07:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of House Bill 233 I
 
07:17:33.288 --> 07:17:33.298 align:start position:0%
did submit testimony through the online
 
07:17:36.468 --> 07:17:36.478 align:start position:0%
portal uh that addresses a number of
 
07:17:40.490 --> 07:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
questions that have come up so uh when
 
07:17:42.410 --> 07:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
you get a chance you can give it a read
 
07:17:44.990 --> 07:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
I did bring a few copies but I'm trying
 
07:17:46.670 --> 07:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
to get away from
 
07:17:49.070 --> 07:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
endowing you all with too much paper and
 
07:17:52.610 --> 07:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
keep it all digital uh
 
07:17:55.610 --> 07:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
this is in my mind a very simple Bill
 
07:17:58.610 --> 07:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
the the words shall be metered which
 
07:18:01.150 --> 07:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
have been in the statute since
 
07:18:04.250 --> 07:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
2012 have made it
 
07:18:07.310 --> 07:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
impossible for the Public Utilities
 
07:18:08.868 --> 07:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
Commission and now the department of
 
07:18:10.910 --> 07:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
energy to consider
 
07:18:14.868 --> 07:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
uh verification and accountability
 
07:18:17.930 --> 07:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
protocols for thermal Rex
 
07:18:21.250 --> 07:18:21.260 align:start position:0%
that do not require a meter
 
07:18:24.110 --> 07:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
and all this bill does is give them the
 
07:18:25.750 --> 07:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
authority to consider alternative
 
07:18:28.670 --> 07:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
methodologies it doesn't mandate that
 
07:18:31.548 --> 07:18:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:34.250 --> 07:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
people will either petition or perhaps
 
07:18:34.260 --> 07:18:35.270 align:start position:0%
people will either petition or perhaps
they'll

07:18:35.270 --> 07:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
they'll
 
07:18:38.690 --> 07:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
consider a stakeholder meeting and throw
 
07:18:40.910 --> 07:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
ideas around and ultimately and my
 
07:18:43.670 --> 07:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
experience with the puc over the years
 
07:18:45.468 --> 07:18:45.478 align:start position:0%
and with the Department of energy is
 
07:18:47.350 --> 07:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
that they interpret their stature
 
07:18:52.250 --> 07:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority very strictly
 
07:18:54.230 --> 07:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
um and very conservatively and I don't
 
07:18:56.208 --> 07:18:56.218 align:start position:0%
think they're going to do anything or
 
07:18:58.670 --> 07:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
approve anything that is contrary to the
 
07:19:01.390 --> 07:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
intent of this legislation
 
07:19:03.890 --> 07:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
I just want to read
 
07:19:03.900 --> 07:19:05.690 align:start position:0%
I just want to read
um

07:19:05.690 --> 07:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:19:09.890 --> 07:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
uh one quick item here from my from my
 
07:19:09.900 --> 07:19:12.048 align:start position:0%
uh one quick item here from my from my
testimony

07:19:12.048 --> 07:19:12.058 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
07:19:14.270 --> 07:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and that is that petitioners are
 
07:19:15.830 --> 07:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
still going to have to demonstrate that
 
07:19:18.548 --> 07:19:18.558 align:start position:0%
an alternative to BQ meters can ensure
 
07:19:21.230 --> 07:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
accurate and independently verifiable
 
07:19:21.240 --> 07:19:22.430 align:start position:0%
accurate and independently verifiable
data

07:19:22.430 --> 07:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
data
 
07:19:27.170 --> 07:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
as the basis for for uh generating and
 
07:19:30.410 --> 07:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
ultimately qualifying thermal racks
 
07:19:32.448 --> 07:19:32.458 align:start position:0%
that's the standard that the department
 
07:19:34.310 --> 07:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
of energy will have to meet in whatever
 
07:19:34.320 --> 07:19:35.868 align:start position:0%
of energy will have to meet in whatever
alternative

07:19:35.868 --> 07:19:35.878 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
07:19:38.330 --> 07:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
methods it it considers
 
07:19:40.670 --> 07:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
and I did want to address a couple
 
07:19:43.788 --> 07:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
questions that came up and just correct
 
07:19:46.070 --> 07:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
the record in in some cases
 
07:19:49.010 --> 07:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Summers you asked several
 
07:19:51.530 --> 07:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
weeks ago on House Bill 166 whether
 
07:19:54.650 --> 07:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts had made the decision to
 
07:19:58.310 --> 07:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
consider biomass as no longer renewable
 
07:20:01.368 --> 07:20:01.378 align:start position:0%
that's true for the renewable portfolio
 
07:20:04.310 --> 07:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
standard which is an electric energy
 
07:20:06.590 --> 07:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
standard it is not true for the
 
07:20:06.600 --> 07:20:07.628 align:start position:0%
standard it is not true for the
alternative

07:20:07.628 --> 07:20:07.638 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
07:20:10.850 --> 07:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard which recognizes
 
07:20:15.048 --> 07:20:15.058 align:start position:0%
renewable thermal energy from biomass
 
07:20:15.058 --> 07:20:15.708 align:start position:0%
renewable thermal energy from biomass
um

07:20:15.708 --> 07:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:18.590 --> 07:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
quite enthusiastically in fact it's that
 
07:20:21.730 --> 07:20:21.740 align:start position:0%
statute that this provision
 
07:20:24.770 --> 07:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
would enable the department of energy to
 
07:20:26.448 --> 07:20:26.458 align:start position:0%
mimic in terms of some of the
 
07:20:28.430 --> 07:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility around
 
07:20:31.910 --> 07:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
verifying heat energy the state of Maine
 
07:20:35.208 --> 07:20:35.218 align:start position:0%
has also adopted procedures that allow
 
07:20:37.730 --> 07:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
fuel input
 
07:20:40.548 --> 07:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
to serve as a proxy for heat output so
 
07:20:42.468 --> 07:20:42.478 align:start position:0%
you've got two neighboring states that
 
07:20:46.190 --> 07:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
have done what this legislation will
 
07:20:48.170 --> 07:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
authorize the department of energy to
 
07:20:48.180 --> 07:20:49.750 align:start position:0%
authorize the department of energy to
consider

07:20:49.750 --> 07:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
consider
 
07:20:49.760 --> 07:20:51.530 align:start position:0%
consider
and

07:20:51.530 --> 07:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:20:53.990 --> 07:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
with that I would be happy to answer any
 
07:20:54.000 --> 07:20:56.208 align:start position:0%
with that I would be happy to answer any
questions

07:20:56.208 --> 07:20:56.218 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:20:56.218 --> 07:20:58.750 align:start position:0%
questions
excellent

07:20:58.750 --> 07:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
07:21:03.350 --> 07:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:05.150 --> 07:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair
 
07:21:05.160 --> 07:21:07.730 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair
um

07:21:07.730 --> 07:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:11.110 --> 07:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation sounds like a good idea
 
07:21:13.490 --> 07:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
and if it's
 
07:21:17.770 --> 07:21:17.780 align:start position:0%
meant to lower the price of compliance
 
07:21:21.110 --> 07:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
by increasing the flow of thermal wrecks
 
07:21:23.230 --> 07:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
into the market
 
07:21:25.910 --> 07:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a good idea too since
 
07:21:28.490 --> 07:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
it sounds like acp's alternative
 
07:21:31.010 --> 07:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
compliance payments have been the
 
07:21:35.270 --> 07:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
the norm or uh but are you as a long
 
07:21:38.330 --> 07:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
time proponent of of the use of
 
07:21:40.850 --> 07:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
thermal energy and the creation of these
 
07:21:44.948 --> 07:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:47.868 --> 07:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
their one result might be a bottoming
 
07:21:49.670 --> 07:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
out of the price of thermal wrecks and
 
07:21:53.030 --> 07:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
and should we also consider an
 
07:21:56.030 --> 07:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
adjustment to the numbers in the thermal
 
07:21:59.030 --> 07:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
07:22:00.048 --> 07:22:00.058 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
07:22:03.468 --> 07:22:03.478 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds um
 
07:22:06.410 --> 07:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
I suppose yes I'm I'm concerned I I
 
07:22:09.830 --> 07:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
think when thermal was added to the RPS
 
07:22:13.070 --> 07:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
through Senate Bill 218 in 2012. it was
 
07:22:16.968 --> 07:22:16.978 align:start position:0%
a very small increment as a sort of a
 
07:22:16.978 --> 07:22:18.010 align:start position:0%
a very small increment as a sort of a
test

07:22:18.010 --> 07:22:18.020 align:start position:0%
test
 
07:22:22.128 --> 07:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
uh not long after the thermal Provisions
 
07:22:22.138 --> 07:22:24.490 align:start position:0%
uh not long after the thermal Provisions
became

07:22:24.490 --> 07:22:24.500 align:start position:0%
became
 
07:22:28.490 --> 07:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
effective in 2014 upon the adoption of
 
07:22:28.500 --> 07:22:29.690 align:start position:0%
effective in 2014 upon the adoption of
rules

07:22:29.690 --> 07:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
rules
 
07:22:32.208 --> 07:22:32.218 align:start position:0%
the price of oil and propane
 
07:22:35.468 --> 07:22:35.478 align:start position:0%
dropped quite dramatically and as Mr
 
07:22:40.070 --> 07:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
Nichols testified earlier the cost of
 
07:22:42.468 --> 07:22:42.478 align:start position:0%
conventional fossil heating fuels drives
 
07:22:45.288 --> 07:22:45.298 align:start position:0%
a lot of the interest in alternatives
 
07:22:48.708 --> 07:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
when they're cheap as they have been at
 
07:22:50.868 --> 07:22:50.878 align:start position:0%
various times in the past
 
07:22:53.810 --> 07:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
people go with convenience they go with
 
07:22:56.330 --> 07:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
Oil propane and natural gas when they're
 
07:22:59.150 --> 07:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
expensive people
 
07:23:01.070 --> 07:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
take a hard look at the Alternatives
 
07:23:05.150 --> 07:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
heat pumps geothermal solar thermal
 
07:23:07.788 --> 07:23:07.798 align:start position:0%
solar PV with heat pumps
 
07:23:10.368 --> 07:23:10.378 align:start position:0%
modern wood heating they start looking
 
07:23:12.770 --> 07:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
at the alternatives
 
07:23:12.780 --> 07:23:14.270 align:start position:0%
at the alternatives
um

07:23:14.270 --> 07:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:23:17.270 --> 07:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
I I think it's appropriate that the
 
07:23:20.750 --> 07:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
legislature consider adjusting all of
 
07:23:23.330 --> 07:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
the classes in the RPS as legislation
 
07:23:27.350 --> 07:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
has contemplated on several occasions
 
07:23:27.360 --> 07:23:28.990 align:start position:0%
has contemplated on several occasions
uh

07:23:28.990 --> 07:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:23:31.430 --> 07:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the
 
07:23:35.150 --> 07:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
RPS effectively comes to an end in 2025
 
07:23:35.160 --> 07:23:36.410 align:start position:0%
RPS effectively comes to an end in 2025
although

07:23:36.410 --> 07:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
although
 
07:23:39.590 --> 07:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
it continues at the levels that are in
 
07:23:41.510 --> 07:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
place the mandates that are in place as
 
07:23:44.570 --> 07:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
of 220 2025
 
07:23:47.150 --> 07:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
but it would not be inappropriate for
 
07:23:49.968 --> 07:23:49.978 align:start position:0%
this body to take a look
 
07:23:53.628 --> 07:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
at those uh targets uh every other New
 
07:23:55.570 --> 07:23:55.580 align:start position:0%
England state has
 
07:23:57.890 --> 07:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
significantly increase their renewable
 
07:24:00.110 --> 07:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
energy mandates through their RPS or
 
07:24:02.990 --> 07:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
equivalent programs in recent years
 
07:24:06.110 --> 07:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
most notably uh Rhode Island which last
 
07:24:09.350 --> 07:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
year increased their RPS Mandy to 100
 
07:24:13.368 --> 07:24:13.378 align:start position:0%
percent by 2030. Maine uh Massachusetts
 
07:24:16.730 --> 07:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
Connecticut 48 percent uh just as a
 
07:24:18.288 --> 07:24:18.298 align:start position:0%
result of legislation just a couple
 
07:24:21.288 --> 07:24:21.298 align:start position:0%
years ago whether you agree that that's
 
07:24:24.410 --> 07:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
the right way to achieve a more
 
07:24:26.750 --> 07:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
aggressive vision for renewable energy
 
07:24:30.288 --> 07:24:30.298 align:start position:0%
or not is is a matter for healthy debate
 
07:24:33.190 --> 07:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
but I think it's appropriate to consider
 
07:24:36.350 --> 07:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not we're we're at a point
 
07:24:38.090 --> 07:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
where we need to take another look at
 
07:24:38.100 --> 07:24:40.190 align:start position:0%
where we need to take another look at
that

07:24:40.190 --> 07:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:24:42.650 --> 07:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:24:44.690 --> 07:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you for
 
07:24:45.948 --> 07:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
07:24:48.048 --> 07:24:48.058 align:start position:0%
and I'll call up
 
07:24:59.868 --> 07:24:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:01.548 --> 07:25:01.558 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for Mr
 
07:25:05.990 --> 07:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:09.770 --> 07:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
representative louder Step Up
 
07:25:11.690 --> 07:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
hi sorry put you on the stand that's
 
07:25:11.700 --> 07:25:12.468 align:start position:0%
hi sorry put you on the stand that's
fine

07:25:12.468 --> 07:25:12.478 align:start position:0%
fine
 
07:25:13.968 --> 07:25:13.978 align:start position:0%
um would you be in favor of having a
 
07:25:15.948 --> 07:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
single class in the RPS
 
07:25:19.548 --> 07:25:19.558 align:start position:0%
uh a single just so all renewable energy
 
07:25:21.830 --> 07:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
and eliminate all the other other
 
07:25:21.840 --> 07:25:23.448 align:start position:0%
and eliminate all the other other
classes

07:25:23.448 --> 07:25:23.458 align:start position:0%
classes
 
07:25:25.610 --> 07:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
um is that what this bill would do I
 
07:25:27.170 --> 07:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
mean I I guess I'm a little confused as
 
07:25:28.548 --> 07:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
to why that question is being posed to
 
07:25:31.310 --> 07:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
me right now in this particular hearing
 
07:25:33.288 --> 07:25:33.298 align:start position:0%
you need to follow up yeah well it's
 
07:25:34.368 --> 07:25:34.378 align:start position:0%
something that we we've talked about
 
07:25:34.378 --> 07:25:35.690 align:start position:0%
something that we we've talked about
before

07:25:35.690 --> 07:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
before
 
07:25:39.410 --> 07:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
um removing classes adding classes so
 
07:25:41.810 --> 07:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
um just wondered how what you thought
 
07:25:44.090 --> 07:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
about once just one class yeah well so
 
07:25:47.330 --> 07:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
so uh I I answer questions like this as
 
07:25:49.070 --> 07:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
a student of History I think it's it's
 
07:25:51.170 --> 07:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
worth asking why the RPS is structured
 
07:25:54.110 --> 07:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
the way it is and the the smaller
 
07:25:57.288 --> 07:25:57.298 align:start position:0%
subclasses you know uh two three and
 
07:25:59.690 --> 07:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
four were three and four in particular
 
07:26:01.610 --> 07:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
were put in place to make sure that
 
07:26:03.590 --> 07:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
existing sources of generation that
 
07:26:05.390 --> 07:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
already are in place and functioning in
 
07:26:07.430 --> 07:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire weren't
 
07:26:09.048 --> 07:26:09.058 align:start position:0%
um weren't crowded out of the market as
 
07:26:11.990 --> 07:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
new generation came in and so the the
 
07:26:13.850 --> 07:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
question that this committee would have
 
07:26:16.128 --> 07:26:16.138 align:start position:0%
to ask itself is is that legislative
 
07:26:18.890 --> 07:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
goal no longer a policy priority for the
 
07:26:20.510 --> 07:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
07:26:23.030 --> 07:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
um when I when I look at the the members
 
07:26:24.530 --> 07:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
of clean energy New Hampshire many of
 
07:26:27.230 --> 07:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
which are businesses that are that are
 
07:26:29.990 --> 07:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
um that are owners of that generation I
 
07:26:32.030 --> 07:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
think a lot of them would would to have
 
07:26:33.350 --> 07:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
would take issue with the idea of
 
07:26:35.030 --> 07:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating the crap the class structure
 
07:26:36.590 --> 07:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
because it the class structure
 
07:26:38.090 --> 07:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
recognizes that there are different
 
07:26:40.368 --> 07:26:40.378 align:start position:0%
Capital profiles for different types of
 
07:26:42.410 --> 07:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
businesses that have been in place for
 
07:26:43.670 --> 07:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
longer you know I think of the hydro
 
07:26:46.490 --> 07:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
facilities imagine yourself as the owner
 
07:26:48.948 --> 07:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
of a 100 plus year old piece of
 
07:26:51.230 --> 07:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that requires constant
 
07:26:54.048 --> 07:26:54.058 align:start position:0%
maintenance but is having to having to
 
07:26:56.628 --> 07:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
make a go of it on today's today's
 
07:26:58.910 --> 07:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
energy markets in which there's lots of
 
07:27:01.548 --> 07:27:01.558 align:start position:0%
new technologies coming in and so so I
 
07:27:03.170 --> 07:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
think the class structure really is
 
07:27:04.968 --> 07:27:04.978 align:start position:0%
something that's that's trying to
 
07:27:07.250 --> 07:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
preserve fuel diversity and preserve
 
07:27:10.128 --> 07:27:10.138 align:start position:0%
existing sources of generation now if
 
07:27:13.010 --> 07:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
the question is it might we change the
 
07:27:16.128 --> 07:27:16.138 align:start position:0%
RPS to try to try to achieve some other
 
07:27:18.410 --> 07:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
legislative policy goal I think you know
 
07:27:20.330 --> 07:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
we'd welcome that type of conversation
 
07:27:20.340 --> 07:27:21.770 align:start position:0%
we'd welcome that type of conversation
but

07:27:21.770 --> 07:27:21.780 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:27:25.548 --> 07:27:25.558 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think if if keeping if
 
07:27:27.610 --> 07:27:27.620 align:start position:0%
the question is do would I keep the RPS
 
07:27:30.530 --> 07:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
at the at the level that it's at today
 
07:27:32.810 --> 07:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
so 25 percent renewable energy and then
 
07:27:34.610 --> 07:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
just eliminate the class structure I
 
07:27:36.708 --> 07:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
think the risk there is that some of
 
07:27:38.868 --> 07:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
those existing facilities in New
 
07:27:40.368 --> 07:27:40.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire might might get found
 
07:27:43.250 --> 07:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
themselves crowded out of the market
 
07:27:46.010 --> 07:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
I I will say I'm surprised that to get
 
07:27:47.690 --> 07:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
that question now though about biomass
 
07:27:50.690 --> 07:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
today well to add context we actually
 
07:27:52.490 --> 07:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
did have a bill come through here that
 
07:27:56.090 --> 07:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
would have uh had only one one class in
 
07:27:58.610 --> 07:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
the program so perhaps you missed that
 
07:28:00.830 --> 07:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
day yes and probably would have had some
 
07:28:03.048 --> 07:28:03.058 align:start position:0%
good testimony on that uh had you been
 
07:28:03.058 --> 07:28:03.830 align:start position:0%
good testimony on that uh had you been
here

07:28:03.830 --> 07:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:28:05.448 --> 07:28:05.458 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on representative
 
07:28:05.458 --> 07:28:07.670 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on representative
partial

07:28:07.670 --> 07:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
partial
 
07:28:09.110 --> 07:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
and Sheriff
 
07:28:11.510 --> 07:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
and uh this might be a question that
 
07:28:13.190 --> 07:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
might be difficult to answer
 
07:28:16.850 --> 07:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
um but we are speaking of a renewable
 
07:28:20.990 --> 07:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
product with uh thermal uh with wood
 
07:28:24.708 --> 07:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
um but it is not carbon neutral
 
07:28:28.190 --> 07:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
and I guess what I would like to know is
 
07:28:30.590 --> 07:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
so much I have some Assurance on is that
 
07:28:33.350 --> 07:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
that will be part of the formula as well
 
07:28:36.410 --> 07:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
as we go forward and looking how we can
 
07:28:39.890 --> 07:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
possibly replace our fossil fuel with
 
07:28:42.890 --> 07:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
wood how does the uh how will that be
 
07:28:45.110 --> 07:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
affecting our carbon foot fit moving
 
07:28:45.120 --> 07:28:46.010 align:start position:0%
affecting our carbon foot fit moving
forward

07:28:46.010 --> 07:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
forward
 
07:28:49.010 --> 07:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh the the the question of the carbon
 
07:28:51.830 --> 07:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
neutrality of biomass is an incredibly
 
07:28:53.750 --> 07:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
complicated one that it's actually very
 
07:28:56.930 --> 07:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
difficult to answer and so uh asserting
 
07:28:59.390 --> 07:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
that biomass is not carbon neutral I
 
07:29:01.070 --> 07:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
think actually think is not correct in
 
07:29:02.868 --> 07:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
fact there are many organizations that
 
07:29:05.090 --> 07:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
find that do that do assert that that
 
07:29:07.548 --> 07:29:07.558 align:start position:0%
biomass is carbon neutral of course the
 
07:29:09.110 --> 07:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
question of how you account for the
 
07:29:11.390 --> 07:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions in the biospheres as I
 
07:29:13.788 --> 07:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
said very very complicated I would
 
07:29:15.468 --> 07:29:15.478 align:start position:0%
answer that the question of carbon
 
07:29:17.510 --> 07:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
neutrality in New Hampshire's forests
 
07:29:19.610 --> 07:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
though very simply which is that if you
 
07:29:22.610 --> 07:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
look at the broad macro Trends which
 
07:29:24.590 --> 07:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
again I'll do what Scott Nichols did and
 
07:29:26.810 --> 07:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
say I know this because Charlie nibling
 
07:29:28.010 --> 07:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
told me
 
07:29:29.810 --> 07:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
um which is that there that we are
 
07:29:31.968 --> 07:29:31.978 align:start position:0%
growing vastly more wood than we are
 
07:29:33.650 --> 07:29:33.660 align:start position:0%
cutting in New Hampshire at current
 
07:29:36.770 --> 07:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
trends because uh large users of
 
07:29:39.468 --> 07:29:39.478 align:start position:0%
low-grade wood have have phased phased
 
07:29:41.750 --> 07:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
out in recent decades so the pulp Mills
 
07:29:44.270 --> 07:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh and now the biomass electric burning
 
07:29:45.708 --> 07:29:45.718 align:start position:0%
plants up in up in Northern New
 
07:29:49.910 --> 07:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so uh we're a long way in
 
07:29:51.350 --> 07:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's woods from finding
 
07:29:53.208 --> 07:29:53.218 align:start position:0%
ourselves in a place where we're where
 
07:29:54.948 --> 07:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
we're cutting more than we're then we're
 
07:29:54.958 --> 07:29:56.030 align:start position:0%
we're cutting more than we're then we're
burning

07:29:56.030 --> 07:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
burning
 
07:29:58.368 --> 07:29:58.378 align:start position:0%
um if we were to see those Trends start
 
07:30:00.350 --> 07:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
to reverse then we might need to get
 
07:30:01.850 --> 07:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
serious about how are we doing our
 
07:30:04.310 --> 07:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
carbon Accounting in our woods but as it
 
07:30:07.250 --> 07:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
stands uh the the the the wood markets
 
07:30:08.750 --> 07:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
are hurting and that means that there's
 
07:30:10.310 --> 07:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of wood growing out there thank
 
07:30:12.590 --> 07:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
you for your reassurance thank you I'm
 
07:30:15.410 --> 07:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
gonna end whoops okay I'm gonna ask
 
07:30:18.048 --> 07:30:18.058 align:start position:0%
clients representative Pelosi he hasn't
 
07:30:20.628 --> 07:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh asked a question yet so
 
07:30:23.868 --> 07:30:23.878 align:start position:0%
here we are my guest uh thank you Vice
 
07:30:23.878 --> 07:30:26.150 align:start position:0%
here we are my guest uh thank you Vice
chair

07:30:26.150 --> 07:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:28.788 --> 07:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
I I wonder if you could ask a question
 
07:30:30.650 --> 07:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a
 
07:30:33.048 --> 07:30:33.058 align:start position:0%
you could point the committee to someone
 
07:30:36.770 --> 07:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
I understand over the years I think it's
 
07:30:38.330 --> 07:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
eight years
 
07:30:41.750 --> 07:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
our carbon heat sink in New Hampshire
 
07:30:44.270 --> 07:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
which I thought was mostly forests has
 
07:30:44.280 --> 07:30:45.190 align:start position:0%
which I thought was mostly forests has
been

07:30:45.190 --> 07:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
been
 
07:30:47.868 --> 07:30:47.878 align:start position:0%
getting smaller
 
07:30:49.968 --> 07:30:49.978 align:start position:0%
I have the numbers but not in front of
 
07:30:49.978 --> 07:30:50.750 align:start position:0%
I have the numbers but not in front of
me

07:30:50.750 --> 07:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
me
 
07:30:53.810 --> 07:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
but there is data showing our carbon
 
07:30:57.350 --> 07:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
sink in New Hampshire is lessening and
 
07:31:00.530 --> 07:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
then I hear more trees are growing do
 
07:31:04.250 --> 07:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
you know where this carbon normally goes
 
07:31:06.530 --> 07:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
if it's not going to trees thank you so
 
07:31:08.330 --> 07:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
I would love to see whatever Source
 
07:31:10.368 --> 07:31:10.378 align:start position:0%
you're citing uh and and help interpret
 
07:31:10.378 --> 07:31:11.090 align:start position:0%
you're citing uh and and help interpret
it

07:31:11.090 --> 07:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:31:13.548 --> 07:31:13.558 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that the loss of
 
07:31:16.490 --> 07:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
forest land in New England as a whole
 
07:31:18.410 --> 07:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire New Hampshire as well
 
07:31:20.150 --> 07:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
as part of that you know as part of that
 
07:31:22.430 --> 07:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
Regional trend is largely driven by
 
07:31:22.440 --> 07:31:23.690 align:start position:0%
Regional trend is largely driven by
development

07:31:23.690 --> 07:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
development
 
07:31:26.048 --> 07:31:26.058 align:start position:0%
um and and as opposed to as opposed to
 
07:31:29.750 --> 07:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know the timber industry uh losing
 
07:31:31.548 --> 07:31:31.558 align:start position:0%
wood lots and turning them into housing
 
07:31:33.590 --> 07:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
developments is is the the greatest
 
07:31:35.990 --> 07:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
threat to the carbon sink in in New
 
07:31:36.000 --> 07:31:38.390 align:start position:0%
threat to the carbon sink in in New
Hampshire

07:31:38.390 --> 07:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:39.650 --> 07:31:39.660 align:start position:0%
but would love to see that report
 
07:31:41.628 --> 07:31:41.638 align:start position:0%
whatever it is
 
07:31:44.448 --> 07:31:44.458 align:start position:0%
you follow up
 
07:31:46.128 --> 07:31:46.138 align:start position:0%
um Vice chair just to answer the
 
07:31:49.628 --> 07:31:49.638 align:start position:0%
question it was a I think it's a Federal
 
07:31:52.190 --> 07:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
Environmental study but I can get that
 
07:31:53.150 --> 07:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
for you
 
07:31:55.670 --> 07:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
all right for a few
 
07:31:58.610 --> 07:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent months I'll take one
 
07:32:01.548 --> 07:32:01.558 align:start position:0%
last question thank you thank you for uh
 
07:32:03.650 --> 07:32:03.660 align:start position:0%
being here again today the reason I keep
 
07:32:05.628 --> 07:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
asking people how many wrecks this could
 
07:32:08.208 --> 07:32:08.218 align:start position:0%
be could potentially generate is I'm
 
07:32:10.490 --> 07:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
trying to get a sense of you know what
 
07:32:13.788 --> 07:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
this what these additional wrecks and
 
07:32:16.610 --> 07:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
the reduction in ACP payments might have
 
07:32:19.010 --> 07:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
on power rates
 
07:32:21.230 --> 07:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
is there any that's that you provide any
 
07:32:22.850 --> 07:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
insight it's a great question and I
 
07:32:24.410 --> 07:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
think I could work with the folks who
 
07:32:27.350 --> 07:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
are have a better uh a better finger on
 
07:32:29.390 --> 07:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
the pulse of the pellet industry in
 
07:32:30.890 --> 07:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
particular to try to come up with some
 
07:32:32.628 --> 07:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
sort of estimate I think generally
 
07:32:34.368 --> 07:32:34.378 align:start position:0%
speaking any estimate that we were to
 
07:32:35.868 --> 07:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
come up up with might be a little bit
 
07:32:37.910 --> 07:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
back of the napkin and so I wouldn't put
 
07:32:40.310 --> 07:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
a great deal of faith in it
 
07:32:41.810 --> 07:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
um but you know if you look at the
 
07:32:44.270 --> 07:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
latest renewable energy fund uh uh
 
07:32:46.128 --> 07:32:46.138 align:start position:0%
report I mean it's the alternative
 
07:32:48.890 --> 07:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
compliance payments for for the t-rec
 
07:32:51.830 --> 07:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
classes in the neighborhood of 1.8
 
07:32:53.510 --> 07:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
million I think
 
07:32:55.610 --> 07:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
um and so any any T-Rex that are
 
07:32:56.990 --> 07:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
generated are going to lower that number
 
07:32:59.208 --> 07:32:59.218 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the goal of this bill
 
07:33:02.628 --> 07:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
follower okay so I yeah what I'm trying
 
07:33:04.128 --> 07:33:04.138 align:start position:0%
to do is just get an order of magnitude
 
07:33:05.570 --> 07:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
and I think you've kind of provided a
 
07:33:07.310 --> 07:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
little bit of insight that I mean if all
 
07:33:09.890 --> 07:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
of the 1.8 million went away which it
 
07:33:11.330 --> 07:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't on year one you're not correct
 
07:33:13.850 --> 07:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
you're not talking about a dramatic
 
07:33:16.788 --> 07:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
change in in electric rates okay thank
 
07:33:16.798 --> 07:33:18.288 align:start position:0%
change in in electric rates okay thank
you

07:33:18.288 --> 07:33:18.298 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:33:20.990 --> 07:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony
 
07:33:26.510 --> 07:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:29.690 --> 07:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:29.700 --> 07:33:31.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:33:31.330 --> 07:33:31.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:33:33.410 --> 07:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
Jason stock
 
07:33:35.690 --> 07:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
how could you possibly have not come
 
07:33:38.930 --> 07:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:41.810 --> 07:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
you know I thought I was gonna
 
07:33:44.030 --> 07:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
sneak out of the room and wouldn't be
 
07:33:45.830 --> 07:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
any questions uh for the record I'm
 
07:33:47.510 --> 07:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
Jason stock I'm the executive director
 
07:33:49.430 --> 07:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
07:33:51.230 --> 07:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
Association and
 
07:33:53.868 --> 07:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
although I hadn't planned and we I come
 
07:33:55.548 --> 07:33:55.558 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill
 
07:33:58.490 --> 07:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
we do support the bill we have members
 
07:34:02.510 --> 07:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
that um participate in the t-rec market
 
07:34:04.910 --> 07:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
they burn wood
 
07:34:07.070 --> 07:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
um and so we we do come in support of
 
07:34:09.590 --> 07:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
the bill I just wanted to kind of
 
07:34:11.448 --> 07:34:11.458 align:start position:0%
clarify a couple things
 
07:34:13.010 --> 07:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and I'd be happy to answer questions
 
07:34:15.770 --> 07:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
is is a state we do continue to grow
 
07:34:18.708 --> 07:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
more wood than we Harvest
 
07:34:21.170 --> 07:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
um where is carbon stored it is stored
 
07:34:23.628 --> 07:34:23.638 align:start position:0%
in the leaves the branches and even in
 
07:34:26.090 --> 07:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
the soil so there's a there's carbon
 
07:34:28.548 --> 07:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
even in the soil in in a forest soil
 
07:34:30.410 --> 07:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
both you know in the Duff and of course
 
07:34:32.150 --> 07:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the roots of the of the plants
 
07:34:32.160 --> 07:34:33.530 align:start position:0%
in the roots of the of the plants
themselves

07:34:33.530 --> 07:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
07:34:35.448 --> 07:34:35.458 align:start position:0%
so when you look at Carbon and there's
 
07:34:38.570 --> 07:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
there are studies upon studies that look
 
07:34:39.708 --> 07:34:39.718 align:start position:0%
at this
 
07:34:41.930 --> 07:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
um there are studies that show that even
 
07:34:44.570 --> 07:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
you know with our forest and they're
 
07:34:46.270 --> 07:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
continuing to grow
 
07:34:48.708 --> 07:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
carbon is being continues to be stored
 
07:34:52.548 --> 07:34:52.558 align:start position:0%
at all levels of of the landscape and so
 
07:34:57.230 --> 07:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
inasmuch as this bill or even you know
 
07:34:59.990 --> 07:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
the the biomass energy energy plants if
 
07:35:01.310 --> 07:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
a couple of those were to come back
 
07:35:04.128 --> 07:35:04.138 align:start position:0%
online we'll continue I am very
 
07:35:05.510 --> 07:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
confident that we'll continue to grow
 
07:35:08.570 --> 07:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
more wood when we look at wood Harvest
 
07:35:10.930 --> 07:35:10.940 align:start position:0%
and mortality data
 
07:35:13.910 --> 07:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
and growth data even from back in the
 
07:35:16.310 --> 07:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
days when Berlin was up and running and
 
07:35:19.010 --> 07:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative Noel knows that facility
 
07:35:21.350 --> 07:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
used a lot of wood
 
07:35:23.510 --> 07:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
um even in those days we continue to
 
07:35:26.330 --> 07:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
have a positive balance of growth in the
 
07:35:26.340 --> 07:35:27.048 align:start position:0%
have a positive balance of growth in the
state

07:35:27.048 --> 07:35:27.058 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:35:30.288 --> 07:35:30.298 align:start position:0%
in fact one of the one of the concerns
 
07:35:31.868 --> 07:35:31.878 align:start position:0%
when you talk to kind of
 
07:35:34.010 --> 07:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
silviculturalists and biometricians that
 
07:35:36.410 --> 07:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
study this one of the concerns is that
 
07:35:38.150 --> 07:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
our forests are actually getting older
 
07:35:41.628 --> 07:35:41.638 align:start position:0%
and getting too old and like humans as a
 
07:35:44.150 --> 07:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
forest gets older its growth starts to
 
07:35:44.160 --> 07:35:45.288 align:start position:0%
forest gets older its growth starts to
slow

07:35:45.288 --> 07:35:45.298 align:start position:0%
slow
 
07:35:48.170 --> 07:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
and so when you talk to some of these
 
07:35:50.330 --> 07:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
folks and even the wildlife people
 
07:35:51.530 --> 07:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you we don't have enough
 
07:35:53.030 --> 07:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
younger Forest
 
07:35:55.250 --> 07:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
we need to be having more forests out
 
07:35:58.548 --> 07:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
there that are younger so I raised these
 
07:36:00.770 --> 07:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
points just to show and try to hope to
 
07:36:04.250 --> 07:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
allay any concerns that this bill or any
 
07:36:06.170 --> 07:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
of the other biomass bills that you've
 
07:36:08.510 --> 07:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
heard in in recent weeks that
 
07:36:10.368 --> 07:36:10.378 align:start position:0%
you know if if adopted we're going to
 
07:36:11.868 --> 07:36:11.878 align:start position:0%
wake up one morning and there'll be a
 
07:36:14.690 --> 07:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
moonscape out there with with no trees
 
07:36:16.610 --> 07:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
and just a field of stumps that's not
 
07:36:19.010 --> 07:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
going to happen as Scott Nichols had
 
07:36:19.020 --> 07:36:20.448 align:start position:0%
going to happen as Scott Nichols had
said

07:36:20.448 --> 07:36:20.458 align:start position:0%
said
 
07:36:24.708 --> 07:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
you biomass whether it's wood chips or
 
07:36:26.690 --> 07:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
wood chips that go into pellets they are
 
07:36:29.868 --> 07:36:29.878 align:start position:0%
a byproduct of
 
07:36:33.288 --> 07:36:33.298 align:start position:0%
harvesting for for timber for lumber
 
07:36:35.690 --> 07:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
um and so with you know two-thirds to
 
07:36:36.948 --> 07:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
three quarters of everything that's
 
07:36:39.590 --> 07:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
standing out there but it being low
 
07:36:41.990 --> 07:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
greed it's just inevitable you're going
 
07:36:45.110 --> 07:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
to produce it and so this
 
07:36:47.090 --> 07:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
thermal markets do present an
 
07:36:50.090 --> 07:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity it's it's a it do they do
 
07:36:52.730 --> 07:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
present an opportunity to utilize this
 
07:36:56.390 --> 07:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
material and so it from the forest but
 
07:36:58.730 --> 07:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
also from our Mills that are producing
 
07:37:01.310 --> 07:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
Lumber they take a round log they Square
 
07:37:04.190 --> 07:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
it up they chip the slabs a lot of that
 
07:37:07.010 --> 07:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
product goes into these types of
 
07:37:09.530 --> 07:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
facilities as well so I just wanted to
 
07:37:11.930 --> 07:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
speak to this and and I think when I
 
07:37:16.430 --> 07:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
testified on 166 earlier this uh I think
 
07:37:18.350 --> 07:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
it was two weeks ago I provided a
 
07:37:19.850 --> 07:37:19.860 align:start position:0%
graphic from our friends at the
 
07:37:22.190 --> 07:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture that shows and
 
07:37:24.708 --> 07:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
differentiates the carbon Cycles
 
07:37:27.410 --> 07:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
looking at a geologic versus I think
 
07:37:27.420 --> 07:37:28.368 align:start position:0%
looking at a geologic versus I think
it's

07:37:28.368 --> 07:37:28.378 align:start position:0%
it's
 
07:37:29.990 --> 07:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
the biological I'll call it the
 
07:37:32.330 --> 07:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
biological carbon Cycles
 
07:37:34.368 --> 07:37:34.378 align:start position:0%
and kind of that difference and I think
 
07:37:36.650 --> 07:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
that's something we you know this
 
07:37:39.288 --> 07:37:39.298 align:start position:0%
program does not tap into that geologic
 
07:37:41.990 --> 07:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
cycle this is on the left side of the
 
07:37:45.468 --> 07:37:45.478 align:start position:0%
paper with the kind of biologic cycle
 
07:37:47.208 --> 07:37:47.218 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll be happy to answer any
 
07:37:47.218 --> 07:37:51.948 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll be happy to answer any
questions

07:37:51.948 --> 07:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:55.010 --> 07:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds Reynolds please
 
07:37:56.628 --> 07:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
ask your question
 
07:37:58.788 --> 07:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair
 
07:38:00.770 --> 07:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
um Scott with your testimony today are
 
07:38:03.110 --> 07:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
you going on record in favor of
 
07:38:07.368 --> 07:38:07.378 align:start position:0%
discrimination against older forests
 
07:38:10.510 --> 07:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
I love all forests
 
07:38:14.030 --> 07:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
and with that we will thank you thank
 
07:38:17.510 --> 07:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr Jason stock for answering those
 
07:38:19.968 --> 07:38:19.978 align:start position:0%
questions and seeing no other speakers
 
07:38:22.310 --> 07:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
we will close
 
07:38:22.320 --> 07:38:23.650 align:start position:0%
we will close
HB

07:38:23.650 --> 07:38:23.660 align:start position:0%
HB
 
07:38:26.090 --> 07:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
233 FN
 
07:38:28.730 --> 07:38:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you all and I will turn the
 
07:38:31.548 --> 07:38:31.558 align:start position:0%
meeting over to our wheelchair chair
 
07:38:41.750 --> 07:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:44.448 --> 07:38:44.458 align:start position:0%
thanks everybody not much to add but
 
07:38:48.170 --> 07:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
just to remind you all that Thursday we
 
07:38:50.868 --> 07:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
will hear two more bills and then we
 
07:38:54.708 --> 07:38:54.718 align:start position:0%
will have an extensive executive session
 
07:38:57.128 --> 07:38:57.138 align:start position:0%
starting at one o'clock in the afternoon
 
07:38:59.810 --> 07:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative closure will give us some
 
07:39:03.350 --> 07:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
statistics about the blue sheet for the
 
07:39:05.150 --> 07:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
last couple of bills
 
07:39:08.448 --> 07:39:08.458 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair and the previous
 
07:39:08.458 --> 07:39:10.070 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair and the previous
bill

07:39:10.070 --> 07:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:39:14.448 --> 07:39:14.458 align:start position:0%
House Bill 524 the blue sheet was six in
 
07:39:18.650 --> 07:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
support one opposed on line 47 in
 
07:39:22.490 --> 07:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:25.250 --> 07:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
House Bill 233
 
07:39:27.230 --> 07:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet
 
07:39:30.350 --> 07:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
had three in support none of polls on
 
07:39:34.490 --> 07:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
line 50 in support none of pulse thank
 
07:39:39.170 --> 07:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
you chair okay I apologize
 
07:39:43.128 --> 07:39:43.138 align:start position:0%
for online 50 and support one a pulse
 
07:39:46.548 --> 07:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
thank you oh okay
 
07:39:47.868 --> 07:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:39:50.330 --> 07:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
so we're done thanks everybody for being
 
07:39:52.610 --> 07:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
here today and we look forward to seeing
 
07:39:54.590 --> 07:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
you on Thursday and of course we'll see
 
07:39:56.030 --> 07:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
you all tomorrow
 
07:39:59.750 --> 07:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the uh in Representatives Halls house
