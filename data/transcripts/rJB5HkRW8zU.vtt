00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities
 
00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 align:start position:0%

so
 
00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
with that i had distributed
 
00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
um to the members of the subcommittee
 
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
work group
 
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
suggestions offered
 
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
and in
 
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
in color as well as we had seen it
 
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.550 align:start position:0%
in color as well as we had seen it
previously

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
and i will
 
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
open the floor to my committee
 
00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members to
 
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
ask the relevant questions that they may
 
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh to the
 
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
audience and i'm sure
 
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
someone will be able to or possibly
 
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
attempt these questions i have a few
 
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.389 align:start position:0%
attempt these questions i have a few
um

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
we talked about waste reduction for new
 
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire because that's one of the
 
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
goals that we're aiming for and we
 
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
have a percentage that we need to
 
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.229 align:start position:0%
have a percentage that we need to
decrease

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.110 align:start position:0%
decrease
um

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.190 align:start position:0%
um
by

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
with that being said
 
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know in understanding the type of
 
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
recyclables that are going in as
 
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.710 align:start position:0%
recyclables that are going in as
feedstock

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
feedstock
 
00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 align:start position:0%
it would appear to me and i could have
 
00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
this wrong
 
00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.030 align:start position:0%
this wrong
that

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire could never supply a plant
 
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
with enough feedstock from its own
 
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
sources so my question is
 
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 align:start position:0%
and i know this is a very subjective
 
00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.869 align:start position:0%
and i know this is a very subjective
question

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 align:start position:0%
what percentage
 
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 align:start position:0%
would have to come in from other states
 
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
and with that percentage of recyclables
 
00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
coming into from other states what is
 
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
the waste that is going to go back into
 
00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire landfills that otherwise
 
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
would not be going in there
 
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
and if anyone could answer that i'd
 
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah feel free to come up state your
 
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
name and
 
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.229 align:start position:0%
name and
yep

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
like i said it's a very subjective
 
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.710 align:start position:0%
like i said it's a very subjective
question

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 align:start position:0%
there you go thank you um for the record
 
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
my name is jody grimblets and i work
 
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
with the american chemistry council um i
 
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
think that's a really good question but
 
00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's a really like you said it's it's a
 
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's an unknown right now um
 
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
do we know the size of the facility that
 
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
would come into new england and
 
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
potentially look at new hampshire as a
 
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
place to be we don't know that at this
 
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
point in time um so you know do we think
 
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire would be able to you
 
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
know satisfy all of its needs it's going
 
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
to depend on what size a facility is
 
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
actually being contemplated here
 
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
i will note that in the legislation
 
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that was discussed in
 
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
the senate which i think is towards the
 
00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
end of the bill
 
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire be given new
 
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.270 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire be given new
hampshire's

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire's
 
00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
waste or plastic polymers post use would
 
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
be con given like first consideration so
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
that we're we're using our own um
 
00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
materials before we look elsewhere to um
 
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
to other states
 
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately i don't have an answer
 
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
because the bill is looking just to set
 
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
the regulatory parameters but i don't
 
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
know yet what the case use will be or
 
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
the situation that could come to new
 
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.270 align:start position:0%
the situation that could come to new
hampshire

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
when it says will be given consideration
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that they have to take
 
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.189 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that they have to take
it

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
is that correct correct and one of the
 
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
um i did have a request from another
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
member of the legislature representative
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
spang came to the initial hearing and
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
she asked about the thought of changing
 
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
the word consideration to priority i
 
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a concern for us i
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
leave that to this committee to consider
 
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
but i did tell her i would bring that to
 
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
your attention i think she also brought
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
one question that i did have that i feel
 
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
has still
 
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps gone unanswered is just at what
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
level of confidence
 
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
you folks have that
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
this sourcing for this
 
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
plastic feedstock
 
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.150 align:start position:0%
plastic feedstock
would

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
come to you fairly free of
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
contamination what the contamination
 
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
levels of acceptable
 
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
feedstock would be
 
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i did notice in what you offered up
 
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
that you had noticed uh that you had
 
00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.550 align:start position:0%
that you had noticed uh that you had
mentioned

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
that any materials brought in for
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
processing but rejected as not
 
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate shall be transferred or
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
disposed of in accordance with existing
 
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
solid waste regulations
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
um so to that end
 
00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.590 align:start position:0%
um so to that end
what

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
have you enumerated what the rejection
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
process would be um no i don't know if
 
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
maybe can i bring craig cookson out sure
 
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.390 align:start position:0%
maybe can i bring craig cookson out sure
um

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
i think also one of the other thoughts
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
here's my my thought if it's if it's not
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
coming if it's coming from an
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
out-of-state um
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
feedstock provider hannaford and and in
 
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
a massachusetts store if it's not up to
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
spec then perhaps it goes back to the
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
hannaford store in massachusetts it may
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
just go back to
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the the key thing
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
is that this is a very
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
highly technological process
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
so they specifically monitor just as you
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
would if you were again i use this uh
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me this analogy last week if
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
you're a bakery and you get and you're
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
making cupcakes and brownies and cookies
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
and other things and you get eggs in
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
that don't meet your specification the
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
eggs are old they're rotten they don't
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
taste good
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
they're going to send those back number
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
one and they're probably going to stop
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
doing business with that generator as
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
well so the key thing is remember these
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
are plastics that these facilities are
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
paying for because the process is
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
monetized along the value chain so they
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
are going to have a tight specification
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
that because this is an alchemy right so
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
what comes in the door has to be managed
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
now if they do send something back i
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
think the the purpose of that um
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
provision in the bill that or that we
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned would be dealt with within
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
context of solid waste laws just as any
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturer has to comply with any sort
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
of by-product that it produces and make
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
sure that it responsibly disposes of
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
something these facilities would too so
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
in other words that's saying that these
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
facilities aren't disposable sites you
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
know i mean they can only use what they
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and what um if i may ask a
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up what
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
assurance do you have from those folks
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
who are sending
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
these items to you that nothing
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
hazardous has been housed in any of the
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
feedstock or
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
any of those things that could
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
potentially pose a risk
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
in the feedstock once it were
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
processed into that
 
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.270 align:start position:0%
processed into that
um

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
using syllosis or any of those other
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
things yeah that's a good question uh so
 
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
number one is again as a business if
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
they're they're not gonna pay for
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
something that's going to cause them a
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
problem that's i think number one and
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
most important because anything
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
hazardous or that poses a challenge they
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
have to manage in some way it's either
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
going to you know it could get and
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
contaminate the oil and then they don't
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
have a product that they can sell to a
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
downstream customer or number two they
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
have to manage it and then pay somebody
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
to take it off their hands so from a
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
business sense they are uniquely
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
um and very much uh incented to make
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
sure that they cause they test
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
everything that comes in the door and if
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
they again a very high-tech product
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
process where they're constantly testing
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
the product they produce testing um
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
every throughout the system they know if
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
different contaminants and they can
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
trace that back to whoever might have
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
provided that so there's those controls
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
but in addition to that specifically in
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
the bill in the in the definition of
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
post-use polymers which is the feedstock
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
for these facilities we specifically say
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
that the feedstocks cannot be mixed with
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
solid waste or hazardous waste so their
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
controls actually in the text of the
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
legislation as well that prohibit that
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
and does that
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
one one more does that also include any
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
plastics that may be derived from
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
medical sort of sources we are seeing a
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
huge array of different plastics in the
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
medical industry so i'm curious to know
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
how and if you're regulating that
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
and in in which ways you would be
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
accepting or not accepting some of those
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
materials yeah so a lot of sort of the
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
red bag um
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
medical materials are regulated as
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste so those would be at
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
this point kind of prohibited at being
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
used as a feed stock unless you know new
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire for some reason made an
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
but basic plastic stuff that let's say
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know a wrap that you know when
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
someone is unwrapping a sanitary
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
something in a doctor's office that
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
plastic could be used but not the red
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
oh yes thank you i just wanted to make
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
sure that those on the subcommittee had
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
a chance to ask rep bixby yeah so
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
um continuing on with the pro
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
continuing on with the process of
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh how the
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh the plastic gets from the plastic
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
producer whether it's a hannaford or
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's a
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
i say it's a transfer station
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh is that
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
generally done by an ancillary business
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
that sell would do the sorting and then
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
sell to the
 
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.110 align:start position:0%
sell to the
uh

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
advanced recycler recycler or is that
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
on or would that be another branch of
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
the advanced recycler or would that
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
sorting happen at the advanced recycler
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good question we're kind
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
of seeing both right now is
 
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.470 align:start position:0%
of seeing both right now is
um

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
so number one is if you're getting a
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
sort of just plastic film from a
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
hannaford that is
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
clean and pristine so that would likely
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
go direct to the facility however
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
if there is a
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
transfer facility or a materials
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
recovery facility that's sorting
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
plastics from other plastics and metal
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
and glass
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
we're finding that facilities are
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
wanting there to be an extra step in
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
there to pre-process that into a more
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
consistent feed because they're looking
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
at different types of resins there's a
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
company called cyclix
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
investment from
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
and partnerships with pretty much of all
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
of our members
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
exxon mobil uh lion del basel chevron

america styrenics um
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
several uh this i could give you a whole
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
list of companies that have signed up so
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
cyclix's business model is they want to
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
be more of the aggregator of plastics
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
and then process it so that it's a more
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
consistent feed so they can do it um
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
in higher volumes
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
they can make a consistent feed and then
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
they can also sort of pass those cost
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
savings on to the buyers of that
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
feedstock this is really a good example
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
in houston i think i talked about that
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
houston has partnered um one
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
sort of waste hauler company um exxon
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
and liondell the city of houston as well
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
as cyclics have all partnered together
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
to really try to source a lot more of
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
these non-recycled plastics
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
out of the waste stream to be used as a
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
feedstock for advanced recycling and i
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
and before i keep going um i just i i'm
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
sorry because i just dove in here but
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
just i know there's some new folks here
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
today uh just i'm craig cookson i'm the

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.030 align:start position:0%

council

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
i said this last week it's always great
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
to be back in new hampshire i'm actually
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire native i was born in
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
keene new hampshire and my father worked
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
at kingsbury corporation for 27 years
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
and my mother worked at
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
keene state college for a long time as
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
well in the president's office so always
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
great to be back here even though it's a
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
little tougher getting up here today
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
one follow-up and then representative
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
comtois and then representative kaplan
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
so uh for the purposes of um
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
one of the this one thing that this
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
build does is it changes the definition
 
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.910 align:start position:0%
build does is it changes the definition
of

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.710 align:start position:0%
of
the

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
plastic feedstock from being solid waste
 
00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:29.110 align:start position:0%
plastic feedstock from being solid waste
to

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.550 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
to being uh essentially a
 
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturing feed stock
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
and one thing that's not clear in the
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
bill is where
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
where in that where in the process that
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
happens and i think that one thing we
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
may we we would like to see is more
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
specificity that
 
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.870 align:start position:0%
specificity that
uh

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
it is that it only ceases to be solid
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
waste once it has gone through that
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
final sorting process to make it
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
i think is that something was that
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
consistent with i would suggest that the
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
the question i believe is for
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
if it intrinsically if it has value
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
right which people are paying for it's
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a waste right right now i think
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's really the big difference is
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
solid waste is something that doesn't
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
have any value because it's you know
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's um it's garbage basically
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
right so you're either you're being
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
somebody is being paid to take it off
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
your hands to either you know burying a
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
landfill or combust
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
as energy here there's monetary value in
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
the plastics and people are paying for
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
them so after you
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
after they have been and this is and i
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
think you've asked this question uh
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative bixby is
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
after the plastics have been sorted from
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
other plastics and other
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
metals at a materials recovery facility
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
most states do treat that as no longer a
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
waste right because now you have a
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
commodity that has value right so in new
 
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.710 align:start position:0%
commodity that has value right so in new
hampshire

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
when you sort out your number one and
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
number two bottles and those are sold
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
into the markets and those are very
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
competitive right now i mean these are
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
going for uh maybe five hundred dollars
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
a ton your high density polyethylene
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
milk jugs are at like three thousand
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
dollars a ton right now very valuable um
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's no longer treated as a waste by
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
most states because of they've been
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
sorted from the waste stream at that
 
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.910 align:start position:0%
sorted from the waste stream at that
point

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up so is it but in new
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire is it not the case that that's
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
are they considered still a waste
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
product in new hampshire
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's kind of unclear which is one of the
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
reasons why we want to make sure that
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's clear in state statute for
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
companies to to come here to invest
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to make sure that
 
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.509 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to make sure that
that

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
the feed stock that they're getting is
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
not classified as solid waste
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
would you be able to forward us some
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
statute from other states where that you
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
think would be a good model for
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
making that distinction between reuse
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
no longer waste and uh you know so that
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
we can figure out how to put that
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
separation into our language
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
because i'm not sure that what you have
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
in the in the
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
amendment is proposed does that sure
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
i i would say that most
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
most if not
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say all because there's
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
always exceptions but most states
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
regulate the facilities that have
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
received a
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
sorted kind of gradable commodity as a
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer not as a as a waste
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
facility but i don't know i'd have to
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
look to see
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
in-state statute where it says you know
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
at you know this time you know along the
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
chain it's no longer a waste but it's
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
generally accepted that if you're buying
 
00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:54.389 align:start position:0%
generally accepted that if you're buying
a

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
a plastic or paper or cardboard or
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
aluminum or whatever it is that that at
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
that point you're no longer you know
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
you're paying for it as a
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
as a valuable commodity it's no longer a
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
waste and you're a manufacturer because
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
you're taking it and upgrading into
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
represent bixby if you look at the
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
definition of posters polymer where
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
we're defining that
 
00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:18.549 align:start position:0%
we're defining that
product

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
in e
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
it mentions all the pieces that have to
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
go into that posters polymer the plastic
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
is processed at an advanced recycling
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
facility or held at such facility prior
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
to processing
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
um and it's been plastic it's been
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
sorted from solid waste so doesn't that
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
definition kind of give you that that
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
blip in time of when that becomes
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
the thing i threw out in the trash
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
versus now it's
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
meets the a b c d and e and now it's
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
separate wouldn't that be the
 
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.590 align:start position:0%
separate wouldn't that be the
distinction

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
because that wouldn't be what i just
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
put in my trash that's going to the
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
landfill right i just like to remind
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
folks that the questions come through
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
the show so
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
um i'm
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'll have to take another look at that
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
representative combo and then
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan thank you madam
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.990 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
and listening to
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
all of this because it's another plastic
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
that can be used as feedstock does this
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
put more
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
regulations on folks
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
where they have recycling where they'll
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
have to separate even more has that
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
happened in other states i guess my
 
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.789 align:start position:0%
happened in other states i guess my
question

00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
no and and i think the
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
the hope for as this sort of
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
kind of continues to mature
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's actually it takes financial
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
pressure off communities because right
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
now here's a good example i had a greek
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
salad from your cafeteria seven second
 
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
week in a row and uh i was in a little
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
bit of a little behind today so
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
we got it to go and the chicken came in
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
this uh foam container right now this
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
foam container
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
is a waste in new hampshire if you throw
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
it in the recycling bin it's not gonna
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
get recycled it's called wish cycling so
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's likely to go in the garbage and
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
then you're gonna have to a community
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
concord is going to have to pay somebody
 
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.470 align:start position:0%
concord is going to have to pay somebody
to

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
take it off their hands right
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
imagine if we have the demand so that
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
this becomes instead of a cost
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
a revenue stream to the community
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
because somebody wants this so it
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
actually opens up new opportunity for
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
communities to turn what right now is a
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:35.029 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so i guess my question is is unless
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
residue we'll just put put it that way
 
00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:47.350 align:start position:0%
residue we'll just put put it that way
um

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
it's would be unacceptable in your
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
facility but what you're saying is
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
there's another aggregator that's going
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
to be going through and doing a
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
cleansing process on all of this is that
 
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.710 align:start position:0%
cleansing process on all of this is that
correct

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so one of the benefits of advanced
 
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.390 align:start position:0%
yeah so one of the benefits of advanced
recycling

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
and i think we have this written in the
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
definition of post-use polymers as well
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
is it can handle some residues now they
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to have a lot of residue
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
right because anything that isn't
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
plastic plastic is carbon and hydrogen
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
atoms um doesn't necessarily convert to
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
this end product that you want it to
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
there would be sort of a there are
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
oftentimes a little bit of a
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
pre-processing step where this doesn't
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
go in sort of like this they're going to
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
shred it up this is foam so they might
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
densify it a little bit and then they
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
melt it before going in the system and
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
they might drag a magnet over it just to
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
make sure there's no fugitive metals
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
going in as well
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
you know every now and then you might
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
a random chunk of metal or something
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
thrown in somehow that uh you know so so
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
there's so there are a few sort of
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
little process steps beforehand um but
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
yeah this you wouldn't see this kind of
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
going down a conveyor into the system
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
this would be long chipped up and
 
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.590 align:start position:0%
this would be long chipped up and
densified

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
densified
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
and we have some good videos that we
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
could send along um insider i did a
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
video on a company called braven and
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
you'll actually see
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
the plastic and it's actually this kind
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
of like
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
big sort of densified chunks of plastic
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
going in so you know again you don't see
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
like these and different types of
 
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.149 align:start position:0%
like these and different types of
products

00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
again and i want to
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
i want to be sorry to keep on jumping in
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
but i want to just make the stress the
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
point again is that this is just
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
you know diametrically the opposite
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
of the way we handle garbage right now
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
right i mean we just tip garbage
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
directly in the landfill after we've dug
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
a hole and we covered with dirt or this
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
just gets thrown into a combustor and
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
you know it's
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
essentially combusted to turn into
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
electricity this is a much
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
much more
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
sophisticated process um from from kind
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
of soup to nuts
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
i had i will recognize you in one second
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
i just had a question along those lines
 
00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.270 align:start position:0%
i just had a question along those lines
uh

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
relative to miss grimbolus's um
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
testimony where you had mentioned that
 
00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:55.990 align:start position:0%
testimony where you had mentioned that
perhaps

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
rejected materials might be then
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
returned to their source location
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
have you had any conversation with
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders around that if items were
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
getting returned what the legality would
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
be if something was
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
not up to spec or not up to snuff how
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
does that then if if
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
if that were potentially something you
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
said no this is a hazardous material or
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't whatever um what is that
 
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.149 align:start position:0%
it doesn't whatever um what is that
process

00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
same with any sort of uh business
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
arrangement there'd be a contract that
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
both sides likely a legally binding
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
contract over the laws of you know under
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
the laws of new hampshire that would
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
both that would bind both parties to the
 
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.350 align:start position:0%
both that would bind both parties to the
agreement

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.070 align:start position:0%
agreement
so

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
the feedstock provider would say we will
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
provide plastic meeting this spec at
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
this time in these quantities and the
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
buyer the advanced recycling facility
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
would say okay you're to provide me with
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
this plastic meeting this spec at this
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
price and then of course there'd be
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
terms in that contract about what
 
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.350 align:start position:0%
terms in that contract about what
happens

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
so likely it would either be sent back
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
to the generator and say this did not
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
meet our spec you keep it and deal with
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
it or
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
if the cost was incurred on the advanced
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
recycler to dispose of that off spec
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
then that cost would be borne by the
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
supplier so it'd be it depends on the
 
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.909 align:start position:0%
supplier so it'd be it depends on the
contract

00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and then the one other thing
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
that i had a question on was with regard
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
to the new edition in here where we were
 
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh let me go back to where that is
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
yes so it's the green purpose for the
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
purposes of this chapter the products of
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling do not include
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
hydrocarbons which are sold or marketed
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
as fuel for energy
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
so i i was thinking back to the previous
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
testimonies as well where you had stated
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
that there are some portions of this
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
that might go back into the process and
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
be used to fuel
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
itself is that correct the uh the
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
process that's would these two things be
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
in conflict with one another
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
no they wouldn't so
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is talking about let's say as
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this is as new hampshire
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
wants to see this turned into feedstock
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
polystyrene is actually a really
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
interesting one you can take this and
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
actually using these processes break it
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
down into styrene monomer and then it
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
can go right back into polystyrene
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
production again like fully circular a
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
lot of cool innovation going on in
 
00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.909 align:start position:0%
lot of cool innovation going on in
polystyrene

00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
polystyrene
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
so that would count for new hampshire's
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
recycling rate right
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
however if you take this and let's say
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
they turned it into a fuel it would not
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
count as recycling for new hampshire so
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
that i think that's what we're trying to
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
is that that these facilities are not
 
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
is that that these facilities are not
producing

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
producing
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
fuels and then counting that as
 
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.310 align:start position:0%
fuels and then counting that as
recycling

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know recycling is turning back into
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
a product and i think we felt like the
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislation based on the products um has
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
that pretty well covered but um you know
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
uh we this is kind of extra comfort i
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
think in the in the language
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kaplan
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you chair for taking my
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
question and thank you mr cookson uh
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about these
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
aggregator facilities that seem to be
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
necessary for the feedstock to be clean
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
going into an advanced recycling
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
facility the aggregator facility itself
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
is not an advanced recycling facility is
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
right and and so they wouldn't fall
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
under the regulations of this
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
bill they would likely still be listed
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
they would be regulated as a kind of a
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
materials recovery facility um under
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
your laws here in new hampshire okay
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
because they're not doing advanced
 
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.630 align:start position:0%
because they're not doing advanced
recycling

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
and my second question is uh
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
concerning the fuel and you mentioned
 
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.310 align:start position:0%
concerning the fuel and you mentioned
polystyrene

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
polystyrene
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
and we got to list one of your plants or
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
one of the remember plants out in oregon
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
does this process polystyrene to styrene
 
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.710 align:start position:0%
does this process polystyrene to styrene
and

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
we received information that that plant
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
is also you know
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
one of the byproducts is some hazardous
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
waste including like lead and cadmium
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
if they're following the procedures that
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
you're that you're talking about how is
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
this hazardous waste getting produced
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
and is it getting produced in the
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
product itself the styrene or is it in
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
the emissions
 
00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:07.669 align:start position:0%
the emissions
so

00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
not 100 certain on you know they're so
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
let me first say that there's a lot of
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:15.350 align:start position:0%
kind of
um

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
accusations i think against these
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
companies that are not based on sound
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
science or actually anybody that has
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
visited a commercially operating plant
 
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.190 align:start position:0%
visited a commercially operating plant
right

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of it is based on
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
very very old data
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
or laboratory studies so you'll find
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
that in several reports you know
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
anti-advanced recycling reports
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
agilex has got a great partnership with
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
the state of oregon um we can look into
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
what you say but these facilities are
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
not receiving
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
lead and i forget what the other thing
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
you said was
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know number one that's not in
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
plastics um number two
 
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.149 align:start position:0%
plastics um number two
every

00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
bit of polystyrene every ounce that they
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
receive in the door right now gets
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
turned into styrene monomer and they
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
have off-take with they have actually a
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
joint venture with a company called
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
america styrenics
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
that has very aggressive goals about
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
making sure that this in the future is
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
made from
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
in that agilex facility just as a
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
additional point of clarification sorry
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
to interrupt um i've been there probably
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
10 times over the last 10 years it's in
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
oregon so i usually go once a year but
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
i've seen their evolution
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
as a company um going from a a batch
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
process that made sort of a synthetic
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
crude oil
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
that was sold to a refiner to now sort
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
of retrofitting that process into one
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
that does polystyrene to styrene monomer
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
they also draw a lot of their
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
energy from
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric so it is an electric
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
facility up there that is uh very green
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative homeless thank
 
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.590 align:start position:0%
thank you representative homeless thank
you

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um i had a question about
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
the language in the amendment should i
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
direct that to you
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
or to you all
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
to all okay um
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
at the end in regulation of advanced
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
recycling 149 m62 i'm just curious why
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
this one last sentence was scratched out
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
the department may enter and inspect any
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling facility can you
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
the language that is not stricken in
 
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.510 align:start position:0%
the language that is not stricken in
that

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
that number one that roman numeral
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
number one is the language that we had
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
worked with the department of
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
environmental services on in the senate
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee um it was language that
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
they had helped us draft
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
the language that is stricken we had
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
actually worked off of a draft that
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
represented bixby had given to us um and
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
that was language that and we've talked
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
about that he had put in there and i
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
sent a note to represent this be saying
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
we did take that sentence out because we
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
had made agreements with the department
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
of environmental services and we felt
 
00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:02.310 align:start position:0%
of environmental services and we felt
uncomfortable

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
on unraveling that
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
agreement that was made in the senate so
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.549 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
two sentences before that also still has
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
the department may enter and it's
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
inspect any advanced recycling facility
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
determine whether storage materials
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
prior etc etc so that that sort of enter
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
and inspect provision is still in there
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
and if i could have followed
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
um the question i also had is that uh on
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
the first page let me get down to the
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
right line i don't have lines in mind
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
apologize but
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
under the new paragraph different
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
definitions of advanced recycling a
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
little bit ways down there's a strikeout
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
but are not limited to
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
what is the basis for striking that out
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
i think there was a a
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
request to be more specific
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
that the products of advanced recycling
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire are going into um
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
commodity products or raw materials that
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
go into recycling markets and there was
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
concern that sort of an unlimited may
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
lead the door open to fuels so we wanted
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
to clarify that this is the intent is
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you um lastly the lead
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph the lead two paragraphs going
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
into that was that something off of a
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion by you all or was that was
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
the the findings and purpose and then
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this chapter the first
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
was concerned that it was not clear from
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
the bill as it as it was presented that
 
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.430 align:start position:0%
the bill as it as it was presented that
um

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:49.510 align:start position:0%
that the
uh

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
these facilities would be
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
regulated under manufacturing it would
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
be subject to all of the manufacturing
 
00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.230 align:start position:0%
be subject to all of the manufacturing
regulations

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to have uh have it laid out
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
in a preamble essentially saying that
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh there were
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
regulations that these uh that these
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
busines that these
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh facilities will be subject to uh that
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
are not
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
that are not part of the um
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
the the bill itself uh that are exist in
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
other parts in statute and um i think
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
this gets
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
moves in the right direction i'm not
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
sure it's got it it's all the way there
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
and uh as for your question about the
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
line that i put in and that was then
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
removed because it didn't match what
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
they had gotten from director wims at
 
00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:45.269 align:start position:0%
they had gotten from director wims at
um

00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
my intent with putting that line in was
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh des in their
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
clean air and water divisions
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
would have the capacity to inspect at
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
any time they needed to in order to
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance etc
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
the issue may be
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
not that the language
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
not the language itself but it would be
 
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
putting it into
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
a solid waste part of the statute and i
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
think we need to uh get
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
is there any from anyone from uh des
 
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.669 align:start position:0%
is there any from anyone from uh des
here

00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
i'm maybe would you be able to clarify
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether that that's just in
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
the wrong place or is uh or is there
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
already language in every clean water
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
and air statute that says there's
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
the department can enter for
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
inspection and compliance ensuring
 
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:50.070 align:start position:0%
inspection and compliance ensuring
compliance

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
actually if you don't mind i'd actually
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
like the department to come forward to
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
be heard at the microphone
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to sit it yes any of the
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mike fitzgerald i'm the
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the air resources
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
division at the department of
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
director wimsatz not able to attend
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
today he did indicate to me that he had
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think the department took a
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
position relative to the
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
to the bill but we did not have any
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
objections and he had no concerns with
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
this language that was shared with us
 
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.070 align:start position:0%
this language that was shared with us
yesterday

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.269 align:start position:0%
yesterday
um

00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
relative to uh
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
almost all of our statutes i i cannot
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
speak specifically to the way statutes
 
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:53.909 align:start position:0%
speak specifically to the way statutes
but

00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
in general stat the statutes do give us
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
the authority to uh
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
to enter in to inspect facilities um
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
to determine compliance with with the
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
applicable statutes i can i can speak
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
specifically we do have authority under
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
rsa 125c and 125
 
00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
rsa 125c and 125
i

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
um 125c is our general air pollution
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
regulations and 125i is our toxics um
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
and uh we we certainly have authority to
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
conduct inspections um
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
and to uh to enforce those um uh
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
the authorities that are given to us in
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
in those statutes uh so
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
i i i don't think that there's any major
 
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.669 align:start position:0%
i i i don't think that there's any major
concern

00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh this this strikeout language it
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
happens to have reference to aaron water
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
and it's in a way statute
 
00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:47.109 align:start position:0%
and it's in a way statute
um

00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
i i assume that ols will take a look at
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
it and and uh
 
00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:52.950 align:start position:0%
it and and uh
um

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know if they if they feel that it
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
causes a conflict but uh as i say uh we
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
we received this yesterday afternoon
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
took a took a brief look at it and and
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
didn't see any concerns with with taking
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
it out because i think we feel we have
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
the the authority that we need
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
um specifically in the waste authority
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's in the two sentences above that
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
were referenced
 
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.030 align:start position:0%
were referenced
um

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh but uh um
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
including it would not be problematic
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
when a manufacturing facility is coming
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
into the state of new hampshire
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
do they are they
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
are is there a requirement a statute
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
that they consult with you about
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
anything that they are going to going to
 
00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:37.829 align:start position:0%
anything that they are going to going to
be

00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
working doing
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
as a manufacturer well speaking
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
specifically from the air permitting
 
00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:45.910 align:start position:0%
specifically from the air permitting
side

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
companies are responsible to determine
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
whether they are subject to
 
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.990 align:start position:0%
whether they are subject to
the

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
ensuing regulations um
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh enva 1400 for instance would be would
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
be the toxics regulation
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
so companies have a responsibility what
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
generally happens is when a
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
company plans to come into new hampshire
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
they will make an appointment and come
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
in and meet with with our department
 
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.710 align:start position:0%
in and meet with with our department
and

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
once we have an
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of what they plan to do we
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
will have representatives from the
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate divisions
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
that would have some responsibility as
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
as part of that meeting
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
but in general uh a facility has a
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility if they're subject to our
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
permitting regulations they have to
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
submit an application and receive a
 
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.910 align:start position:0%
submit an application and receive a
permit

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
permit
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
and if they're subject to the toxic
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
regulations they have to do the
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate determinations to see if
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're emitting those those toxics
 
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.710 align:start position:0%
they're emitting those those toxics
and

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
report to us
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
provide modeling that shows
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
how much the emissions
 
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.950 align:start position:0%
how much the emissions
uh

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.109 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
you know the quantity of emissions that
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
would would go out and if that quantity
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
exceeds the
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh thresholds that are established in
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
our regulation as i mentioned the other
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
day there's 700 some odd um compounds
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
that are that are covered by that
 
00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.630 align:start position:0%
that are that are covered by that
regulation

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
and um we would make a determination as
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
to whether they were subject to uh
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
permitting and
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
um and any of our other regulations
 
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.829 align:start position:0%
um and any of our other regulations
so

00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's a combination the company has
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
a responsibility under those statutes to
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
make a determination and if they're if
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
they're subject to our regulation to
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
submit the appropriate requirements if
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
we find out about them
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
and they have not done so they would be
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
certainly significant enforcement
 
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.710 align:start position:0%
certainly significant enforcement
actions

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
actions
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr fitzgerald may i ask a
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
question as well um sure thank you um so
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
my question to you would be you had
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
previously testified this is a
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
relatively new territory for the
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
department yes and uh i guess with that
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
i was curious to know whether or not you
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
would have had an opportunity elsewhere
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
to tour a facility or to see any other
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
facilities that are out there in
 
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.630 align:start position:0%
facilities that are out there in
operation

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh the only
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
in my experience the only facility that
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of that we've had had any
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
contact with is um and i'm forgetting
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
the name of it now but there's a there
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
was a facility that came to us last year
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
up in
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
groveton i believe
 
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.270 align:start position:0%
groveton i believe
and

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
we did meet with them we took a look at
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
their process i don't know if we toured
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
the facility i don't believe it was
 
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.270 align:start position:0%
the facility i don't believe it was
built

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
built
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.310 align:start position:0%
at that time
and

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
we made a determination that um with
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
regards to uh air toxics and air
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
emissions that it was a closed loop
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
facility and was not subject
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
to our requirements
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
we did understand that they intended to
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
use one of the products
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
that they produced as a fuel for a
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
diesel generator on site
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
they subsequently came to us and
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
indicated that they were just going to
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
use diesel fuel and so we permitted that
 
00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.870 align:start position:0%
use diesel fuel and so we permitted that
facility

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
we do permit emergency generators as
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
well and we permitted that in the way we
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
that we would do so for any any facility
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
such as the one that you can
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
see in the parking lot across the street
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
here um
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's the only fuel that can be
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
used on in that is diesel fuel so if
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
they decide to
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
make a change to that they would have to
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
come to us and revise that permit
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question sure
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
it sounds like that
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
when a advanced recycler comes to you
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to pretty much
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
deliver you
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
a business plan or a production plan or
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
whatever you like to call it both
 
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.829 align:start position:0%
whatever you like to call it both
upstream

00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
upstream
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
sourcing of materials in specifics
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
and the downstream products is is that a
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
correct uh assumption of what uh and
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's on that basis you're going to
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
make determinations yeah in general from
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
from an air perspective which is where
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
my experience is
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
um we would sit down with a facility we
 
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.349 align:start position:0%
um we would sit down with a facility we
would

00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
expect them to provide us with um
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
technical information plans etc
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
that would demonstrate
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh and quantify
 
00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.430 align:start position:0%
uh and quantify
um

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
feed products and
 
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.829 align:start position:0%
feed products and
ultimately

00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
emissions to the air
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
products that they make
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
may or may not be regulated
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.309 align:start position:0%
depending on
um

00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know this statute makes make some uh
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
or this
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation makes some
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh assumptions as to as to how those
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
products would be
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
would be handled i would also point out
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
that certain products
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
fuel products
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
that are produced from processes like
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
this could be subject to federal
 
00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.990 align:start position:0%
this could be subject to federal
regulation

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
have these but um fuels are regulated by
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
epa and have to be registered depending
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
on their
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
on their use
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
i can certainly send the committee some
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
some information relative to epa's fuel
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
registration process and so on and
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's also what are known as
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
non-hazardous secondary material
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
regulations which
 
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.950 align:start position:0%
regulations which
um

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh epa as i think we testified last week
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh epa is currently
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
um taking a look uh at at this and has
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
put out information requesting i put out
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
a a request for information
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
from companies that are planning to do
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
this type of process
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
to provide information and comment on
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
how epa
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
should or should not address
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
these these facilities and the products
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
from these facilities under those
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
non-hazardous secondary materials rules
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
so that's the subject of current federal
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
dialogue and input right now
 
00:41:57.599 --> 00:41:58.790 align:start position:0%
dialogue and input right now
but

00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.910 align:start position:0%
but
so

00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
we may not regulate those products
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
except as 149 m
 
00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:05.990 align:start position:0%
except as 149 m
already

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
states but there could be federal
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
regulation as well
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
but then in general we would
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
look at all this information that's
 
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.910 align:start position:0%
look at all this information that's
provided

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
provided
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
we would sit down with them we may ask
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
questions we may ask them to provide
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
additional information etc and then
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh as as i mentioned with this facility
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
up north we we made a determination that
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
they were not subject to 149c or 140 i
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
mean 125c or 125i
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh except for that diesel generator and
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
so uh if if a facility came in met with
 
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.270 align:start position:0%
so uh if if a facility came in met with
us

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
we would certainly
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
before you issue the permit for them to
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
proceed uh does this get uh written up
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
in a rather detailed
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
extensive contract sort of a document so
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
each one can
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
each side knows what they're going to do
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
and you can regulate and monitor
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
according to what's written in a
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
specific document well i've never heard
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
of it referred that specific way but
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's actually a pretty good uh
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
pretty appropriate that's what a permit
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
is when we issue a permit that permit
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
tells the facility
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
it specifies the processes that they
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
will use it specifies the emissions they
 
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
must meet it specifies the testing that
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
they must do to to determine
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
those emissions and that is a legal
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
and enforceable document for us that um
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
so that if we go and inspect them and
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh they're not
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
it would have record-keeping provisions
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
it would have testing provisions etc
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
that's all available online we always
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
issu when we issue a permit we issue a
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
public notice of that permit we have a
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
30-day comment period we hold a public
 
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
hearing in this town where the facility
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
is located
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
and we receive any public input on that
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
and then we
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
we may incorporate
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
if we receive information from the
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
public or from some other source and
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
we would incorporate that those
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
revisions into the permit we would issue
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
that permit
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
and if it is a federal permit because we
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
do have some responsibility for for
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
issuing permits under title v
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
so if the facility is large enough and
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
meets the criteria to require a federal
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
permit that permit would then be um
 
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.270 align:start position:0%
permit that permit would then be um
uh

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
forwarded to epa and they we would issue
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
the permit but epa would um
 
00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:37.589 align:start position:0%
the permit but epa would um
again

00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and they would provide
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
us comment if they wanted any changes to
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
make it federally enforceable um but in
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
general we would do the issuing of the
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
permit and and we would enforce the
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
federal side of that permit as well
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i i have another
 
00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.150 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i i have another
question

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
for you folks at the acc um
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
so with regard to new paragraph number
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
five where it's
 
00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.069 align:start position:0%
five where it's
uh

00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:07.349 align:start position:0%
uh
e

00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
e
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
where the sentence reads the plastic is
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
processed at an advanced recycling
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
facility or held at such facility prior
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
to processing
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
i i did have some questions sort of
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
about um i've seen various sort of
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the bales of the
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
plastic product that are coming in are
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
held inside some are held outside and i
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
guess i wanted to
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
just talk about you know is this stuff
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
being held prior to it being washed
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
potentially holding remnants of previous
 
00:45:37.839 --> 00:45:39.349 align:start position:0%
potentially holding remnants of previous
uh

00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
things on it and if it would be sitting
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
outside and it's exposed to the weather
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
would there be a chance of potentially
 
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.470 align:start position:0%
would there be a chance of potentially
that's

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
those things
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
the plastic degradation or
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
items sort of run off sort of running
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
out or if it's inside i mean that's
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's an area that it gives me some
 
00:45:59.910 --> 00:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
pause yeah a materials recovery facility
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
where they're sorting plastic from metal
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
from paper from glass they might store
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
plastic bales outside
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
but i don't know of any
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling facility that would
 
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
store plastics outside um and there's a
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
important reason for that is
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
um is number one is is any sort of
 
00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.990 align:start position:0%
um is number one is is any sort of
moisture

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
moisture
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
contamination just water
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
you know uses more energy right it makes
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
the process less efficient
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
and so you know one of the key steps in
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
in um sort of as i mentioned from a
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
pre-processing standpoint is plastics
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
like this would come in and then you'd
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
shred them then you might densify them
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
and then melt them so you get a
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
consistent flow in so any water
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
contamination on this
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
actually you know that water has to
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
essentially cook off right so use energy
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
so it makes the process less efficient
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day what these
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
facilities are trying to do is make sure
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
that every molecule they can goes into a
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
saleable product
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i don't know of any facilities i
 
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.510 align:start position:0%
so i don't know of any facilities i
visited

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
visited
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
i was kind of counting them up on the
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
way i think i visited nine
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
different advanced recyclers over the
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
course the last
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
nine ten years in both the u.s and
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
canada i don't i don't think i've ever
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
seen any that have stored so they're
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
plastics outside they all storm inside
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative bixby do you have a
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
question yes um it's actually a question
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
in that same paragraph
 
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.349 align:start position:0%
in that same paragraph
in

00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:47:23.359 --> 00:47:24.870 align:start position:0%
in
line

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:25.990 align:start position:0%
line
two

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.390 align:start position:0%
two
at

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
letter b
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh it is not mixed with solid waste or
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste on site or during
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
processing so when is on-site does that
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
mean at the
 
00:47:38.559 --> 00:47:40.470 align:start position:0%
mean at the
um

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
at the advanced recycling facility yeah
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's intended to mean within the fence
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
line of the advanced recycler
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
so uh so essentially
 
00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.870 align:start position:0%
so uh so essentially
uh

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
any sorting from
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh materials that would
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
not qualify as feedstock would have to
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
happen before it was on at the at the
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
facility site
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
yeah because your sorting facilities
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
would be regulated as materials recovery
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
facilities under the solid waste laws in
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire these facilities are not
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
sorting right they're receiving uh
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
plastic that's been sorted already okay
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
so i i think that um i i understand that
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
line now but i think we might need to
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
amend it in order to make it clearer
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
since it wasn't entirely clear
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan and then i think
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to sort of make a
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
decision as a subcommittee as to where
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
we would like to potentially go
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
yes a question for um
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
for mr uh goodson cookson cookson
 
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.510 align:start position:0%
for mr uh goodson cookson cookson
cookson

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
cookson
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
um is there anywhere in the in this
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation that uh would
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
determine the ultimate use of the
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
feedstock i don't see anything saying
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
that it can't be used as a fuel for
 
00:48:56.559 --> 00:48:57.829 align:start position:0%
that it can't be used as a fuel for
instance

00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you know the the goal
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
is to create a saleable product and
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
because there's you know it's it's a
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
business but i mean
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing our interest is is is
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
different from your interest our
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
interest is to reduce recycling as it
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
says in the preamble now um
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
to reduce the amount going into the
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
waste room and increase the recycling so
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
the intended use is a fuel uh for say a
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
you know chemical or you know any kind
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
of a cement kiln for instance something
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
like that that really does not help our
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
cause at all it might help you it might
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
help the businesses uh interest so is
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
there anything in this regulation that
 
00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.309 align:start position:0%
there anything in this regulation that
says

00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh this is intended as a feedstock for
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
recycling into uh plastic products not
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
fuel or anything like that yeah i
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
believe in the in the definition of
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling um was that the
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
second sentence where it says recycled
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
products produced at advanced recycling
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
facilities include
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
um and we eliminate the but are not
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
limited to monomers oligomers plastics
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
plastics and chemical feedstocks basic
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
and unfinished chemicals waxes
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
lubricants and coatings so all products
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
of chemistry some of those are more
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
finished products like a wax
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
or a coating
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
and some of those are intermediates or
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
raw materials like plastic and chemical
 
00:50:11.599 --> 00:50:23.670 align:start position:0%
raw materials like plastic and chemical
feedstocks

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
okay i was looking at uh the line uh on
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
section five e i think it was
 
00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:35.349 align:start position:0%
section five e i think it was
uh

00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's uh oh yeah the plastics sorry
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
this section c the plastics use or
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
intended use is as a feedstock for the
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturing of plastic and chemical
 
00:50:43.359 --> 00:50:44.549 align:start position:0%
manufacturing of plastic and chemical
feedstocks

00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
feedstocks
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
other raw materials or other
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
intermediate products or final products
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
using advanced recycling
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
the way i read that that could include
 
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:55.670 align:start position:0%
the way i read that that could include
fuels

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
i i think we're covered from sort of the
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
new addition to again back to the
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
definition of advanced recycling on the
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
first page for the purposes of this
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
chapter the products of advanced
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
recycling do not include hydrocarbons
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
which are solder market as fuels for
 
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.950 align:start position:0%
which are solder market as fuels for
energy

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
representative clemson and then i think
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative pearl might have a few
 
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.910 align:start position:0%
representative pearl might have a few
things

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just a quick
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
question on the words coding
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
and lubricant could that be oil
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
um could you use it for oil
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
not as a fuel like a coating is
 
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
something that goes into like paint is a
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
good example it's a product of chemistry
 
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.270 align:start position:0%
good example it's a product of chemistry
um

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
which you know if we can get that from
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
recycled products instead of you know
 
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.069 align:start position:0%
recycled products instead of you know
virgin

00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
virgin
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
feedstocks like natural gas or oil
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing right we're
 
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
displacing that use of
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
a virgin product and then same thing
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
with a lubricant a lubricant
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
is like something that's in your car
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
engine you know that make sure that the
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
you know the engine doesn't overheat
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
then you have problems so um but it can
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
representative pearl
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair it's fun sitting
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
over on this side
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
well just for the benefit of the
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um you're not forced into
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation this afternoon
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
because what i would like to do
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
is have you
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to take the
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
information which you've been having a
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
great conversation and
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
i certainly appreciate all of the work
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
here with the subcommittee and everyone
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
that's come along
 
00:52:37.599 --> 00:52:38.549 align:start position:0%
that's come along
and

00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
you've had the opportunity to get some
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
good and useful feedback on the
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
questions that you've had so
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
i think the process that we're going to
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
do is we'll next tuesday we will

schedule a brief subcommittee meeting
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
but all i'm going to give you time for
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
is to come in have a quick discussion
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
like 15 minutes and come out with a
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation that will then go to the
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
full committee if that gives you some
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
clarity on on the process going forward
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's fair mr chair
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
i just will remind you we have a hard
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
gamble in at 2 p.m on the next hearing
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
so you're going to have to wrap up in
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
about four or five minutes
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
i would like to recognize the individual
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
sitting at the back with their hand up
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh feel free to come forward if you
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.630 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
my name is john tuthill i'm from akworth
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
i testified at the original hearing i
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted to note that on the house
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
calendar today this was noticed as a
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
continued public hearing
 
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.710 align:start position:0%
continued public hearing
um

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
is that is that what this is a public
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
hearing or a work session no no
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
okay that that is actually on the build
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
docket for um
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
for sb 367. it's noticed as a continued
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
but notice that that we're seeing here
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
it says subcommittee work session 1pm
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
yeah well i'm looking at it online and
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's what comes up on your house
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
anyway i'm not going to belabor the
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
point um
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
however i did hear some things today
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
that concerned me i'm not going to
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
comment on them now and perhaps we'll do
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
that in writing or speaking to
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
one point that really stands out however
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
if you do go to groveton new hampshire
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
you will see
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
extraordinary amounts of plastic stored
 
00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.270 align:start position:0%
extraordinary amounts of plastic stored
outdoors

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
outdoors
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
i've been following that pilot project
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
for years the ones we're seeing across
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
the united states the nine or ten that
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
have been mentioned some of them really
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
have been seriously
 
00:54:46.079 --> 00:54:47.430 align:start position:0%
have been seriously
um

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.470 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
i i just think they've had a hard time
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
bringing these things up to any kind of
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
an industrial level or scale so i hope
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire will wait until epa
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
has really delved into this and i think
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
we're several years from being ready for
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
a bill like this thank you very much
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yeah so um
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
this is a question for the subcommittee
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
and the question is basically
 
00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:13.829 align:start position:0%
and the question is basically
do

00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
does the subcommittee think at this
 
00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:16.549 align:start position:0%
does the subcommittee think at this
point

00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:55:16.559 --> 00:55:18.470 align:start position:0%
point
that

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
it would be possible to pull together an
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
amendment for next week and um
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative homeland and then i'll
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
recognize representative oh sorry
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
i was just thank you chair i was going
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
to just say that i um i don't have any
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
issues with the the
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
meat of the amendment i do have a bit of
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
an issue with the
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
preamble to it because i believe that
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
what the purpose the first sentence of
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
the second paragraph encapsulates
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
everything that this needs to be
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
and i that's just kind of my only
 
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.589 align:start position:0%
and i that's just kind of my only
comment

00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
any further comments from the
 
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:05.349 align:start position:0%
any further comments from the
subcommittee

00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
just comment that um if the subcommittee
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
does come up with
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
further amendments if you could possibly
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
share those with us that
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to take a look at them and
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
see if there was any concerns
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
so i think i i think in that given that
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
we have literally four minutes left i i
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
will continue it again for the
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session to be held
 
00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.990 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session to be held
next

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
let's just give us one second here to
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
you just hang tight we'll confirm a time
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
that way we're
 
00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:14.309 align:start position:0%
that way we're
apologizing

00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
madam chair just just so you're aware
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
next week is new hampshire spring break
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
week that may affect
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
okay so with that then we'd like to
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
um continue
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
until the 26th
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
with a time to be determined
 
00:57:37.119 --> 00:57:38.069 align:start position:0%
with a time to be determined
so

00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:44.710 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just so
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
what i
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
got from uh chairman pearl was that
 
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.829 align:start position:0%
got from uh chairman pearl was that
uh

00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be a very short
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
amount of time to work on this next week
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
so if there is going to be if things
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
need to be further amended
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
then that work needs to be done this
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
coming week and my personal feeling is
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
that although i've done a fair amount of
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
work on the process so far that it
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
should be a member of the subcommittee
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
who is doing the final
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
amendment so i just want to make sure
 
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.589 align:start position:0%
amendment so i just want to make sure
that

00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
there is some sense among the
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee about whether the intent is
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
at this point to come up with an
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
amendment for next week or
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
say that we don't have we we're not
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's a fair um
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
that's a third conversation i do
 
00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.750 align:start position:0%
that's a third conversation i do
um

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:44.549 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um for me
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite there yet
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
i still have questions and i still have
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
some concerns
 
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.390 align:start position:0%
some concerns
um

00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
and it revolves around our solid waste
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
policy not necessarily the actual bill
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
about how this will actually affect uh
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
recycling and reducing our waste in new
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
yes representative homaloff i was just

bixby's question i'm i'm comfortable

with it i would like to to see an
 
00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.109 align:start position:0%
with it i would like to to see an
amendment

00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh finalized amendment and move forward
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
just in case you're taking a poll on
 
00:59:28.559 --> 00:59:32.150 align:start position:0%
just in case you're taking a poll on
that

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
i was going to say i i wouldn't mind
 
00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
despite the assurances from the ds i
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind seeing the original
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
language that was in the senate bill uh
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
around the regulatory framework be
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
reinserted you know
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's just my feeling about it
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
i think the intent is for the
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to work on this and we'll
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
see where we go with this and if we have
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
an agreeable uh amendment available for
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
next week so with that is the intention
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
to work on it
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
is it a recess that this would be in
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
i can close this out then thank you and
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
then it will be continued next week

consistently
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
reached out to work collaboratively with
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
the department of agriculture
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
to assist with enforcing the pet vendor
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
licensure laws
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
and that we are grateful for the
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
department's commitment to enforcing its
 
01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.309 align:start position:0%
department's commitment to enforcing its
provisions

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
when senate 368 was introduced we did
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
have a lengthy conference call to hear
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
from the department what problems they
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
were needing to solve relative to
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
what was explained as two
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
individuals that were transferring pets
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
without a license
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
post revocation of their license for
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
violations of the act
 
01:03:53.359 --> 01:03:54.630 align:start position:0%
violations of the act
and

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
we do appreciate that at the hearing
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
both the department and the senate
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
natural resources committee agreed with
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
akc and new hampshire dogs testimony
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
that the bill is introduced authorizing
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
the seizure by the department of animals
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
senate bill 368 as amended and coming
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
accomplishes two things and we are
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
concerned with them which is why i want
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
to speak with you today
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
it would increase subsequent violations
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
up to five thousand dollars for any
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
violation of the chapter by any pet
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
vendor so it's not specific to
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
anyone whose license had been revoked
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
and is now transferring
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
without a license
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
in the testimony last week
 
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
it was stated that the department had
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
not fined up to the maximum dollar
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
amount of a thousand dollar fine that's
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
allowed in the statute so it's unclear
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
to us how
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
increasing it to a five thousand dollar
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
fine would be useful to the department
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at rsa 437
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
10 which is the penalties section
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
it makes the unlicensed transfer by a
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
pet vendor which means someone who's
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
transferring more than 30 dogs per year
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
as based on the filing of certificates
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
of transfer
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
it constitutes a misdemeanor
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
and we know the department has expressed
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
to you all that they're not getting the
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
assistance they need
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
to enforce it as a misdemeanor
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
in our estimation this is an issue with
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and the doj
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
because as we look at that section of
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
the law it appears as though the
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
department has the tools already in
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
statute that it needs to enforce the
 
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.789 align:start position:0%
statute that it needs to enforce the
section

01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
i think the bigger issue i wanted to
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh revisit was in testimony
 
01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.109 align:start position:0%
uh revisit was in testimony
that

01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
is not addressed in senate 368
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
the department was apparently tipped off
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
about an individual who is transferring
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
pets with no veterinary exam and
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
therefore no
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
health certificate of transfer at all
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
resulting in a complete end around of
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
the law with no consequences
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
in our estimation senate 368 should be
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
amended to fix that problem now not next
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
year otherwise we're spending a lot of
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
time figuring out how to penalize those
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
who are selling healthy pets that have a
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
health certificate of transfer but are
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
doing it without a state license while
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
others are selling pets of unknown
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
health status without a license and no
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
penalty for it
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
with regard to the second part of the
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
bill and establishing a revolving fund
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
to hire hearing officers if eliminating
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
the exorbitant fines of five thousand
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
dollars there is less of a risk of
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and we
 
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
recognize that
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
we do believe the department should have
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
an established amount of money needed to
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
do the job each year preferably through
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
the state budget
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
i did do some research hearing at the
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
department of j of doj
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
their resources are strapped as well it
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
looks as though in fiscal year 2020 and
 
01:07:15.119 --> 01:07:16.950 align:start position:0%
looks as though in fiscal year 2020 and
2021

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
in the budget for doj there was a line
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
item of just over 2 million dollars
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
with 3 000 to train contracted legal
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
counsel to perform these tasks i don't
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
see it in this current biennial budget
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
but there was a line item there so i
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
just acknowledged that as
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
a model that's been used apparently in
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
so in our estimation we'd like to see
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
the committee make some amendments to
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
or send it to study so that we could
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
further examine what the challenges are
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
and be certain that
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
they've been satisfactorily addressed
 
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
with a policy that's effective thank you

a three-month period for instance to
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that those things have been
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
addressed if they're not in those
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%

and with that we're going to close the
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
hearing on senate bill 368 and we're
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%

01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
so we've had
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
good testimony
 
01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.229 align:start position:0%
good testimony
here

01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the in the hearing and
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
in between or in the interim i should
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
say i've had many conversations myself
 
01:12:29.199 --> 01:12:30.149 align:start position:0%
say i've had many conversations myself
with

01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
the members of um that have testified as
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
well as the commissioner you know for on
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of the department about uh
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps an avenue forward where we could
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that were raised
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
here in in testimony and i also did a
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
consultation with the attorney general's
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
office on a couple of ideas that had
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
been presented
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
especially relating to cease and desist
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
powers and just just different actions
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
that we could uh take
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
for to give the commissioner the tools
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
and the power he needs
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
i certainly understand that the
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
frustration that he has in the
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
department you know we the legislature
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
have charged certain duties to his uh to
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
his department and he feels he's not
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
meeting them and failing to do so
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
because he doesn't have the tools
 
01:13:14.159 --> 01:13:15.270 align:start position:0%
because he doesn't have the tools
necessary

01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
and so i think that's
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
one of the key parts of this bill is the
 
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
hearing officer will will help him to
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
to get there and meet at least some
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
portion of what he feels is on his plate
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
that is the wrong paperwork we're not on
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
that bill anymore let me get to the
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
right pile there we go
 
01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.030 align:start position:0%
right pile there we go
so

01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
i had some conversations with um
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative bixby and representative
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
aaron and i have certainly kicked around
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
a couple of ideas and
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
i've also gone to uh the speaker's
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
office and the clerk's office to kind of
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
run through some of the thoughts that i
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
had on a way we could solve sort of a
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
middle ground i think that will fix
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
the majority of what the commissioner is
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
having for concerns and or for
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
issues and
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
also address the majority of the
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
concerns that we heard in testimony
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
so i've asked ols to draft up an
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
amendment and if you've got the senate
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
bill 368 in front of you
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
under section 1 paragraph two
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
that is where it uh seeks to raise the
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
fine from one thousand to five thousand
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
for consistent violations it's not a
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
subsequent violation excuse me
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
the commissioners was in agreement that
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
we could remove that and leave it at the
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
current 1 000 rate
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
he felt that the more important part of
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
the bill for him the biggest tool was
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
setting up the revolving fund and
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
establishing this position of the
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
hearing officer
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
so i've asked ols to draft up an
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that would eliminate
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
that section that raises the fines it
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
will keep the section that uh has the
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
revolt section two with the revolving
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
fund in it in addition it will put a cap
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
of 75 000 a year
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
that will
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
that the department can use for that
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
hearing officer
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
and what i think that does is i think
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
that eliminates some of the concern that
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
was expressed about the possibility of
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
the department using this as a sort of a
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
tool to increase revenue if it was
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
unlimited the more fines that they
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
issued the more they'd have to use for
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
the hearing officer so by capping the
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
fund at least for now at five thousand
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
dollars i think that will take at least
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
a great step toward
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
eliminating that concern of head hunting
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever you want to call it for the
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
department using that as a revenue
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
source because they're currently
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
collecting more than 75 000 so
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
it this would give them no incentive to
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
collect anything further than they
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
currently are
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
additionally we heard concerns from the
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
department that there were
 
01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.830 align:start position:0%
department that there were
areas

01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
in in
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
437 that fell short of allowing them to
 
01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.709 align:start position:0%
437 that fell short of allowing them to
enforce

01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
01:15:58.719 --> 01:15:59.430 align:start position:0%
enforce
the

01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
any uh unlicensed individual from
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
transferring an animal without a health
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
certificate so there was
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
a mechanism that made it illegal in the
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
sense that they were subject to a
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor but there was no real
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement action that the department
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
itself could take because there was no
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
administrative action authorized within
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
because they're not they don't enforce
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty that had to go either
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
through the local municipality or
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
through the department of justice you
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
know or excuse me the ag's office
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
so i've asked that an amendment be
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
drafted to
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
would include language of
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
making it a thousand dollar fine
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
administrative fine that the department
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
could administer if they find that
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
someone is transferring without a
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
license so that would put them on the
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
same level playing field as say a pet
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
vendor that's violating the rules
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
so when this and there's one other
 
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
section in 4
 
01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.990 align:start position:0%
section in 4
37

01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
37
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
8 that we had to do a little bit of
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
cleanup language too that would
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
sort of substantiate that and make it so
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner could do this and
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
it just required us adding that no
 
01:17:07.679 --> 01:17:09.430 align:start position:0%
it just required us adding that no
person

01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me firm corporation or other
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
entities shall transfer ownership of a
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
dog cat or ferret without an official
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
certificate of transfer that just kind
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
of locks it all together and it gives
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
an administrative way to deal with this
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
not just a criminal way
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
so the one thing that happened when i
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
did that which i went to the speaker's
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
office i had a concern that by putting
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
this new fine in
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
which is consistent with the current
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
fines but it's technically a new fine on
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
a different
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
section of the public than it is
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
currently being fined because they're
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
not pet vendors
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
because they hadn't violated the pet
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
vendor statute because they weren't
 
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.590 align:start position:0%
vendor statute because they weren't
registered

01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
registered
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
so that was how they were slipping
 
01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.870 align:start position:0%
so that was how they were slipping
through

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
when i did that i was concerned it would
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
create a non-german amendment which the
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
speaker and the clerk agreed so
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to do is i've had this
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
i'm having this amendment being drafted
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
schedule a non-german amendment
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
hearing for next tuesday
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
and we will
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
hear that as a non-german amendment but
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to hear it and
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
execute on the same day because we're
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
getting to our deadline of getting this
 
01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
getting to our deadline of getting this
done

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
but that's what i've put forward and i
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
think this cleans up all of the issues
 
01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.830 align:start position:0%
think this cleans up all of the issues
or

01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
most all of the issues i'm sorry maybe
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
i've missed something but i ran it again
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
by representative bixby and
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative aaron to kind of make
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
sure we were closing all the loops so
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
with that i'm going to open it up to
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative vicks because i see he
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
has a comment
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so um i have a comment and a
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
question uh my comment is that i think
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
it makes a lot of sense to make sure
 
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
that there is in fact a
 
01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.350 align:start position:0%
that there is in fact a
uh

01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
a fine for transferring animals without
 
01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:51.189 align:start position:0%
a fine for transferring animals without
uh

01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
a health certificate
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
slash certificate of transfer and
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
one thing that i um i
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
i spent a lot of time working on this
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
last a couple years ago
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
and but i don't remember whether the
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
change of term from health certificate
 
01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.590 align:start position:0%
change of term from health certificate
to

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh official certificate of transferred
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
happens has already happened or whether
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
that is something that will happen when
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
the database is up and running
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that
 
01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.189 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that
that

01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
if it if it's currently listed
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
in law as health certificate but is not
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
and and will become official certificate
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
of transfer we want to make sure that
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's covered in both of those situations
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that i'll uh i'll have ols
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
look into that make sure that we're
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
using consistent language thanks
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything they want to
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
add or questions or i hope i was
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
thorough oh yes representative vonsky
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i i like the uh
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
the 75 000 cap and i like
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
what it does i'm just curious is there a
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism available to us
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
to i guess peg that to inflation or
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
something where the commissioner's not
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
going to have to come back every few
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
years and have the cap raised in order
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to afford
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
to do what he's doing with it now
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
is there a mechanism available for us or
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
is that just how it's going to have to
 
01:20:16.639 --> 01:20:18.149 align:start position:0%
is that just how it's going to have to
work

01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think if we put it in statute that's
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
how it's going to have to work
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
we could
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
i think my suggestion would be let's
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
let's start there at least for a short
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
term because the commissioner felt that
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
this was more than sufficient for what
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
he'd need at least for the foreseeable
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
future in my conversations with him i
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to speak for the
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner if i'm if i'm incorrect in
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
that certainly feel free to to correct
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
me but
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i appreciate the
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
work that uh you have
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
have done on this um we don't have a
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
really great way of knowing whether this
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
is going to be sufficient
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
or not but given what we're collecting
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
in fines felt that this was a way to to
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
address the concerns representative
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
pearl and i had a conversation about
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
actually putting something in the budget
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
but given that it
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
was not an early bill there's no
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do this so this was
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps an inelegant solution and
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the future
 
01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.310 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the future
the

01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
the way to to to deal with this will be
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
to budget it and take it out of statute
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
but to to get the ball rolling this
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
i think the way to do it what we've
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
talked about in the department
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
is because we don't know when we don't
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
want to spend
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps all the money early on is we
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
will probably look at some of these
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
fines that traditionally don't go to a
 
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.830 align:start position:0%
fines that traditionally don't go to a
hearing

01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
continue to handle those in-house to
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
to moderate that because many of these
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
are are settled
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
an informal hearing process i did
 
01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.629 align:start position:0%
an informal hearing process i did
um

01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
preside over hearing yesterday and that
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
is one that clearly would have gone this
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
way but there are others where you know
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
the disagreements may be minor and we
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
can settle so we're going to have to
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
sort of guess and engage as we go and go
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
along because the last thing i want to
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
do is
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
um is spend that money if if it were to
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
come to that and then end up with huge
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
cases that would be a drag on our time
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have to sort of play
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
around with this and and see where we
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
are and what the result is but this
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
this gives us so much
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
more ability to to do what the
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
legislature has asked us to do than
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
we've ever had before so we're
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
appreciative of it
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you well i think we as we kicked
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
around it kind of
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
gave us a a opportunity to start the
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
program and see how it went and how
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
things worked and then protected
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
protected the uh you know certainly
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
provided some protections on the other
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
side for those that were skeptical as
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
well that answer your question
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative aaron
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner for your comments i
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
am curious to know with this amendment
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh chairman pearl is proposing
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
how do you see that that may help you
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
with the current two or three really
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
large cases that you're dealing with now
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
well um
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
maybe not with the with the two or three
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
one of them is being handled by by the
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
by the courts but they've asked us to
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
hold off on the defining end of it
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
so as to not confuse the two that that's
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
part of the problem because it is a
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
two-track system it's not either or
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
so in this case the police have taken it
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
as a misdemeanor but we've been dealing
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
with this for
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
at least a year at this at this point
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
since the first arrest was was made
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
getting close to that anyhow um
 
01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.110 align:start position:0%
getting close to that anyhow um
so

01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
if we get to that that point
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
um this would go to a hearing officer
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
because it takes up so much time i think
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
as i i told you last week in this one
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
case we've
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
we've spent uh over a hundred hours
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
um now some of that would have been
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
spent regardless because we're assisting
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
um but it will definitely hear us uh
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
allow us to to go out and do more of the
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
inspections that we've been asked asked
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
to do and that's the
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
the bottom line of this is allowing us
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
anything further representative contra
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
listening to some of the wording changes
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
that you are proposing
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
in the original legislation when we were
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
discussing we had
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
some time where you know someone may
 
01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.750 align:start position:0%
some time where you know someone may
sell

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
sell
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
30 puppies one year and then less the
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
other and they would have an exemption
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
but with this new proposed language
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
they would be guilty
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding and i don't know
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
if your
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
amendment is taking into consideration
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
the discussions that we had um
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
mitigating some of those circumstances
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
that we had discussed when the original
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
language were proposed
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
so i think you're referring to
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
a bill we put in last year that provided
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
an exception process
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
in that exception process we were never
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
intending anyone to transfer an animal
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
without a health certificate that's all
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
this is addressing what what that
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
process was doing was providing an
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
exception from registering as a pet
 
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
vendor that this wouldn't impact that in
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
the least
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding as well chad
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
chairman anything further
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh first of all i appreciate all of the
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
work that you've done on this and i'm
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'm glad that we're going to be moving
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
it forward
 
01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.669 align:start position:0%
it forward
um

01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
i can relate to what the commissioner
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh feels because in the in
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
the conservation commission we have a
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
similar issue where when we see
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
violations we have to refer to code
 
01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.430 align:start position:0%
violations we have to refer to code
enforcement

01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's not enough people in code
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement to work on housing projects
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
problems let alone anything to do with
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
the wetlands and we see this over and
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
over again where violators do egregious
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
things and we just have to let let them
 
01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:19.990 align:start position:0%
things and we just have to let let them
go

01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
so i really appreciate work secondly
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh do you expect that we will be able to
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
get the amendment in enough time
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
are we
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
going to be getting the amendment prior
 
01:26:30.639 --> 01:26:31.430 align:start position:0%
going to be getting the amendment prior
to

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
next week's session so that we can kind
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
of go over it or what is your time frame
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
yes you will it's uh in ols currently
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
being drafted and
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
i will have to have it
 
01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
i believe i have to have it in hand
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
before i can announce it which i should
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
have before tomorrow noon
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
and so once i do have it i will
 
01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
certainly forward it to the committee
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
for review
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
representative perez
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
yeah um i just wanted
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
something to be clarified um so with
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment that you're proposing
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
that will take the penalties
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
of a thousand dollars away
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh for the first um
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
what i'm reading here on the ground bill
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
is a thousand dollars for the first
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
violation and five thousand for each so
 
01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:15.830 align:start position:0%
violation and five thousand for each so
that

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
the new amendment that will take that
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
away no so the new amendment will just
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
eliminate the change it will stay as it
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
currently is where they can be fined up
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
to a thousand dollars
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's currently in statute we just
 
01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be making a subsequent
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
violation of
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
i totally understand that people don't
 
01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
want to pay you know five thousand
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
dollars consequence of violation but
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
i hope and and i would love to see that
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
if we easing with the you know with the
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
violation money um
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
people realize that we're doing
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
something to try not to have people pay
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
more than what they need and now
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully they respect
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
what the commission is trying to do and
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
and all the work that they're putting
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
into all these cases that they have
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
going on and they've been having going
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
on for a while so i i hopefully
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
we're not hurting what they do and now
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay i i believe from the conversations
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and i had that we'd be
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
leaving the current levels of fining in
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
place and we just wouldn't be elevating
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
it but representative murray
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for taking my
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you commissioner so i
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
with respect to this conversation of the
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
two tracks that you have like that are
 
01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
going on in the conversations about when
 
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
something moves forward in a court of
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
law versus through your hearing officers
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
um i guess the question that i have is
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
is there a potentiality for where
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
fines and
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh judicial fines are imposed on
 
01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.350 align:start position:0%
uh judicial fines are imposed on
somebody

01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
and then you uh
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
you're unable to recover the fines and
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
is that when it then gets transferred
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
da's office i'm just trying to
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
understand i apologize
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
no that's that's a good question thank
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
you so the the two tracks are one would
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
be a misdemeanor
 
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
um i think as i said last week i don't
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
expect that anybody would go to jail
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
for that but i think the there is a
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
limit on what you can be fined
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh a misdemeanor so
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
if somebody went to court and the judge
 
01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:28.790 align:start position:0%
if somebody went to court and the judge
said

01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
well it's a misdemeanor and the limit
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
for this misdemeanor is a thousand
 
01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.910 align:start position:0%
for this misdemeanor is a thousand
dollars

01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
in in the case i was talking about we're
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
talking over 150
 
01:29:38.159 --> 01:29:39.510 align:start position:0%
talking over 150
transfers

01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
transfers
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
of animals illegally and the court
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
if they did not wish to put somebody in
 
01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.149 align:start position:0%
if they did not wish to put somebody in
jail

01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
jail
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
potentially would find them a thousand
 
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:48.790 align:start position:0%
potentially would find them a thousand
dollars

01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
we would then go on with our
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
case which could fine them up to a
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for each
 
01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.750 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for each
violation

01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
and each transfer is a separate
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
violation as intended by
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
by the legislature because you don't
 
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.110 align:start position:0%
by the legislature because you don't
transfer

01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
multiple animals under one health
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
certificate you have each one
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
and let me give you an example of how
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
that that breaks down and when i
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
proposed the 5000 i was thinking
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
specifically of that but the hearing
 
01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
that i had yesterday
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
the inspectors wrote out 10 separate
 
01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:25.350 align:start position:0%
the inspectors wrote out 10 separate
incidents

01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
violations but it was one inspection
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
that one inspection constituted one
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
violation even though within
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
areas of concern
 
01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.790 align:start position:0%
areas of concern
so

01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
the first time would have only been
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars now sometimes i think
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
my inspectors are probably a little bit
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
too nice and people aren't taking us
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
seriously because the previous
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
inspection had also uncovered a number
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
of violations but essentially they were
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
just warned but instead of getting
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
better things actually got worse
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
and i would have rather that we had
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
issued a hundred dollar fine
 
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
to start with to get their attention
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't ever want to start out by
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
finding somebody
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars for what are not
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
egregious things but they're in
 
01:31:21.199 --> 01:31:22.550 align:start position:0%
egregious things but they're in
violation

01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
and and what we're seeing is in almost
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
all cases
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
um when we give a warning nobody's
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
taking it seriously and we go back and
 
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
things have slipped even further but
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's still
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
yeah this is actually just um pretty uh
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
for for new members um just a a little
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
thing about bill reading um which is
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
when you have a bill uh
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
the the um the print that's in ordinary
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
type is the existing language in the
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
statute and uh
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
whatever's in
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
the bold italic is the
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh is the new language that's being
 
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
suggested and if there's something
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's in brackets and struck out that
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
is part of the original language so um
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that's that's that's just you know
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's not really obvious when you're you
 
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
know picking up a bill exactly how that
 
01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.310 align:start position:0%
know picking up a bill exactly how that
works

01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
but um that that should help with you
 
01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:25.430 align:start position:0%
but um that that should help with you
just

01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
well representative stapleton you got in
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
just under
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.629 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
so

01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
if i read this correctly you're building
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
in some flexibility but still giving
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
yourselves the tools that you need to
 
01:32:52.110 --> 01:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
handle many different type of
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances here there's a lot to
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
cover in this is there not
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
there certainly is and yes i am trying
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
to build in
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
inflexibility and i want everyone to
 
01:33:01.679 --> 01:33:02.790 align:start position:0%
inflexibility and i want everyone to
understand

01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:03.750 align:start position:0%
understand
that

01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
our intent is not to find people our
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
intent is to bring people into
 
01:33:08.719 --> 01:33:10.310 align:start position:0%
intent is to bring people into
compliance

01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:11.189 align:start position:0%
compliance
but

01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's not been working out very well
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
with the with the gentle hand and that's
 
01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:16.870 align:start position:0%
with the with the gentle hand and that's
why

01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:17.830 align:start position:0%
why
um

01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know we've gotten to these extreme
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
cases not necessarily because of that
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
particularly not in the case where we're
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
seeing you know 150 or more
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
violations of transferring animals and
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
those are where we really need the help
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
but it is amazing just
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
how many of these would go and as my
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
inspector told me yesterday
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
there are cases where they should be
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
writing letters
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and they they simply can't because if
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
they spend all their time
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
writing letters of warning and violation
 
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
then they're not going to be doing
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
inspect inspections on the other
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
um facilities so you know again this is
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
about animal health and well
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
well-being but primarily disease control
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's primarily what this is about and
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
that was many of the things that i heard
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday in the hearing were about lack
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
of documentation
 
01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.510 align:start position:0%
of documentation
that

01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
the the vaccinations were given that the
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
animals were were quarantined had
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
received everything they want
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of these cases we're dealing with
 
01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:23.430 align:start position:0%
a lot of these cases we're dealing with
now

01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
are are rescue places we're seeing an
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
awful lot of animals coming up from the
 
01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.430 align:start position:0%
awful lot of animals coming up from the
south

01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
south
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
and in order to be properly brought into
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
the state they need to be quarantined
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
they need a record of
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know the vaccinations and the
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
testing and some of that is not being
 
01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:41.669 align:start position:0%
testing and some of that is not being
documented

01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
documented
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's sloppy record keeping and the
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
records may be there but
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
people need to do a better job when we
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
go in there
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
they need to have a file on each animal
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
that shows what's required by law
 
01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:54.709 align:start position:0%
that shows what's required by law
and

01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know if people would do that it'd be
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
a lot easier but
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately many of these are
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
home-based rescues
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
with people have
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
really good hearts and they have a few
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
friends who are joining in with their
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
with their organization
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
but they're not following the law is and
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
good as their intents are and our our
 
01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
job is not to say well your intent was
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
was good but you totally
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
violated the law and therefore it's okay
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
and frankly that's what a lot of these
 
01:35:25.199 --> 01:35:26.149 align:start position:0%
and frankly that's what a lot of these
people

01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
want us to see and that's why as i've
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
told you we collect more fines from
 
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
weights and measures but that's not an
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
issue that they're dealing with their
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
heart strings you know it's not an
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
emotional issue these animal rescues are
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
very emotional for these these people
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's it's difficult and it
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
tugs at my heart strings too when i
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
listen to the stories
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's where the hearing officers come
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
in right hands-on and working on many of
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
these problems to um put some force into
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
the law and get derive some order out of
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
this chaotic process
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
so how many hearing officers
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
will you have to do this
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
my hope is that we end up with contracts
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
with three hearing officers because some
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
of this is going to back up depending on
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
the time of year and i'd like to have
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
um multiple availability of hearing
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
officers obviously there's a there's a
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
limit but i don't don't
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
think we would
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
you know be able to handle if there was
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
only one person available because of
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
some of the seasonality of some of what
 
01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:33.270 align:start position:0%
some of the seasonality of some of what
we're

01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're seeing seeing here so i mean who
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
knows we'll work on a contract
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
with doj
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
and and go out and try to find qualified
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
people my thought is we may be getting
 
01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.030 align:start position:0%
people my thought is we may be getting
some

01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
retired lawyers who are just looking for
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit of
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
extra income something to do
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
um you know i haven't sat down and
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
looked what other departments do for
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
qualification certainly
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
you know what we're doing now is
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
with with me or another director as a
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
hearing officer we don't have legal
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
training so it's a little better than
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know a man on the street but we do
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
have a set of documents and guidelines
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
that we have to follow and any hearing
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
officer could
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
could do that ultimately it's about how
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
they see the violation was there a
 
01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:22.950 align:start position:0%
they see the violation was there a
violation

01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
should they be fined for that violation
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things i told one of the
 
01:37:27.119 --> 01:37:29.189 align:start position:0%
one of the things i told one of the
people

01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
the lady yesterday
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
was that while the health certificate
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
was not
 
01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.070 align:start position:0%
was not
completely

01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
filled out well the health certificate
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
that the veterinarian used was
 
01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.390 align:start position:0%
that the veterinarian used was
completely

01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
filled out but it was not a proper
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
health certificate for
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
the transfer
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't expect that a lay person
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
even though it's in the rules would
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily know that there should have
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
been a line there
 
01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.350 align:start position:0%
been a line there
for

01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
where was the animal born
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
and a couple other things
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
i looked at that certificate and said
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
every line is filled out and it has
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
information on it
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
and those are the type of things that
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
should i hold that person responsible
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
well technically yes because it's their
 
01:38:10.159 --> 01:38:11.750 align:start position:0%
well technically yes because it's their
responsibility

01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
but is that really the right thing to do
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're now doing a better job and have
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
finally gotten through to the veterinary
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
association that they need to put out
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
this form because the law doesn't allow
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
us to put out a form the law
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
says what has to be on the form but it's
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner all right all right i'm
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
going to close this work session and
 
01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
we'll let you all know next tuesday and
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure on time yet we're going to
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
work and see what our scheduling is but
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
my anticipation is it'll be mid to late
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
morning but i will see when the room is
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
available and we'll get the notice out
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
to all of you mr chair yes i have one
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
thing for the committee too i just
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to remind you as well i had
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
gotten an email from anton beckerman
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
from unh
 
01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.590 align:start position:0%
from unh
regarding

01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
an invitation for our committee to come
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
and see the unh mcfarland research
 
01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:10.070 align:start position:0%
and see the unh mcfarland research
greenhouse

01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
greenhouse
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
as they have had open houses
 
01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:13.990 align:start position:0%
as they have had open houses
um

01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
he was reaching out to me to find out if
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
our our committee would be interested
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
in doing a little field trip uh some
 
01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.629 align:start position:0%
in doing a little field trip uh some
time

01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
let's see he said sometime in the summer
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
or early fall
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
when the woodman horticultural farm
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
would be at its most active
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
so that our group could get the broadest
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
sense of their research activities their
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
farms dairies and greenhouses
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
and they'd be happy to work
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
around our committee schedule
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
to show us what they are doing over
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
there so i'm putting that out to the
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.709 align:start position:0%
committee and
um

01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
would like to know whether everybody's
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
interested or not and i can certainly
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
work on
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh putting something together for us
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah representative bixby were you
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
interested or did you have a call
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's a great idea and we may
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
also want to get in touch with rob
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
gibson at the uh veterinary pathology
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
lab to uh maybe
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh because he had he had reached out to
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
me at some point about wanting to be
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
able to give us a tour there as well uh
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's all sort of in the same general
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
area so we might want to to do both of
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
those things at the same time okay
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
sounds great to me you want to work on
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
