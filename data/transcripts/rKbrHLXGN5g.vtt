that's due and we wanted to ensure that
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
we gave you as much information as we

to either come back or or address um uh
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
any uh questions that you may may have
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
so um just to give you an overview when
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
we look at um able the able Savings
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
Program um in our world we look at this
 
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:40.759 align:start position:0%
as truly a GameChanger because with able
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
savings accounts individuals with
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
disabilities are able to save money
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
without jeopardizing needs-based
 
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
benefits and typically those needs-based
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
benefits are SSI which is known as
 
00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
supplemental security income as well as
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
and coupled with that is that the monies
 
00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:05.959 align:start position:0%
in the account can now be used on what
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
are referred to as qualified disability
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
expenses um I wasn't able to attend last
 
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
week's um Hearing in person but I did
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
listen to a uh rebroadcast on YouTube
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
and um what what you had heard part of
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
the tenor of the discussion from
 
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
consumers individuals and families of of
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities is that
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
there's that threshold eventally for
 
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
years individuals with disabilities and
 
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
their family members
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
understood that an individual with a
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
disability could only have so much in
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
assets and that was typically about
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
$2,000 if they exceeded the
 
00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:45.799 align:start position:0%
$2,000 then that would jeopardize those
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
benefits that um we just spoke about the
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
U Medicaid and the
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
SSI so what occurred in 2014 uh Federal
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
legislation passed uh which was known as
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
the step Beck Jr of achieving a better
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
life experience act the able act um
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
which essentially um it became federal
 
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
law that now individuals with
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
disabilities could Now open up these
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
accounts and the states would then
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
follow with their own enabling
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
legislation um to allow for those
 
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
accounts in 2016 New
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um had its own um legislation
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
U which is now codified in RSA
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
195k and basically this authorized uh
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
qualified able savings accounts uh in
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire New Hampshire launched its
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
program in
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
2017 and at that time and it's
 
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
understandable because this program was
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
around for a good many of years at the
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
time New Hampshire's program was known
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
as stable St a b l e stable NH um and
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
that was in effect from 2017 up until
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
last year just about this time um when
 
00:18:58.149 --> 00:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
the contract came up for Renewal uh
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
state treasur and myself uh as
 
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
authorized by Statute looked at the
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
program and said are there other options
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
that that may benefit um New Hampshire
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
um so at that point last year um we
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
continued with our obviously our able
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
Savings Program and now in New Hampshire
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's known as the NH able plan and we
 
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:18.919 align:start position:0%
did put brochures what we refer to as
 
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
Slimline brochures inside your folder um
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
so that that'll go over um exactly what
 
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
the account is about so again from an
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
administrative standpoint
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire is now part of the um
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
the national able Alliance which is a
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
Consortium of 19 States and myself and
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
Monica will be the first ones to admit
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
we meet very regularly with our sister
 
00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
States um at the national level as it
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
deals with the operation of um able
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
accounts um in New Hampshire there are
 
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.750 align:start position:0%
accounts um in New Hampshire there are
currently

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
1,184 um account holders uh in the state
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and that includes both
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
the Pharma stable as well as the uh NH
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
aable plan um New Hampshire has roughly
 
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
let's see 11.5 million in assets um
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
under advisement
 
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
nationally uh just to give you a
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
snapshot um there's
 
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
162,000 969 accounts nationally with
 
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
about 1.74 billion in assets so again
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking at in New
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 1184
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
um per the uh Institute on disability um
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
their most recent compendium on
 
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
disability statistics um there our
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
population in New Hampshire is about 1.3
 
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
million and there are 182,000
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
individuals um in New Hampshire per the
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
IOD The Institute on disability um that
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
do report um self-disclosing uh that
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
they have a disability so that that
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
gives you a a very that gives you an
 
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
overview of of administratively um how
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
the um how it works and from a very high
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
level again um when we're looking at the
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire able plan we've always
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
said from day one when we launched in
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it truly is a game changer
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
for individuals with disabilities and
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
their families that that um threshold
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
the spend down that need to ensure that
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
you no longer have that
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
$2,000 that's now been that's gone
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
that's been eradicated with the
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
institution of the able Savings Program
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
um across the country um you know from
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
the governor's Commission on disability
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
we look at the Americans with
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
Disabilities Act as this Monumental
 
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
piece of federal legislation civil
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
rights but when we also when we when we
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
consider other um statutes ael's right
 
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
up there because it did it really it
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
transformed the landscape um so that now
 
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
individuals can save um in without
 
00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:53.799 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing benefits and in conjunction
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
with that and I put it in the handout
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
when an individual is is looking at SSI
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
determination or Medicaid determination
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
I think it was back in 2019 HUD
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
essentially came out with a um I don't
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
want to say a report but essentially an
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh an edict that even housing
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
benefits Section 8 there are a slew of
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
other Federal housing benefits that if
 
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
an individual has in New Hampshire an
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
able uh an an NH able plan account again
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
that won't go into
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
determination um for those Section 8
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
vouchers and that other public housing
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
benefit so you have SSI um you have
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and for the purpose of this um
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
Forum to now think that housing also
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me what for purposes of the
 
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
public housing benefits the monies and
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
the contributions and the interest and
 
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
and I think the state treasurer would
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
agree with that everything in the able
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
account does not get counted um for
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
those Federal housing benefits and it's
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
they're elicit you know inside uh
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
handout we did put together um
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
references that that we can actually
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
send to you by email so that you can
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
hyperlink right over to them it may be
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
helpful um for your report so we're more
 
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799 align:start position:0%
than happy to do that um great again at
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
a very high level in order to have an
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
account the individual um to be eligible
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
the onset of the disability um must be
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
by age
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
26 then there are other criteria and
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
really the criteria that is most often
 
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
talked about the individual um has to be
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive supplemental
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
security income or
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
SSDI um Social Security disability
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
insurance so those are typically the
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
determining factors so the individual
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
opens the account um a loved one can
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
open the account there's a hierarchy of
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
individuals that can open the account um
 
00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:51.559 align:start position:0%
if the individual doesn't have legal
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
capacity to open the account parents
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
Guardians um can step in um if an
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
individual owns the account account in
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
his or her own name they can assign
 
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
power of attorney so that someone can
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
assist them in managing so again when we
 
00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
look at it from uh the disability
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
Community it really we're we're really
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
expanding Freedom um we're ensuring that
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
individuals can can live independently
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
where where I look at this sort of as a
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
toolbox now as with the intent that you
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
have to look at the housing crisis which
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
which we know is is is a is a situation
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
that has to get addressed but now to add
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
this to the resources where it all
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
flushes out we don't know but again to
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
have able at least as something that
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities and their
 
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
families um are aware of so once the
 
00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
money is in the account then you can an
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
individual with a disability can save uh
 
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
18,000 per calendar year um in
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
contributions which is huge um and in
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
conjunction with that if they're working
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
um they can add another roughly about
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
another 14,000 to the account and again
 
00:24:58.029 --> 00:24:58.039 align:start position:0%
this is you know for determining SSI and
 
00:24:58.039 --> 00:24:59.269 align:start position:0%
this is you know for determining SSI and
medic

00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
medic
 
00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
these are safeguarded you know we're not
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
hiding assets here that that's not what
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
we're doing but we're actually putting
 
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
the money where where it can be um you
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know we won't get into it today
 
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
you've heard of Special Needs Trust
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
wonderful vehicles um many individuals
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
with disabilities don't have um a
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
special needs trust but able accounts
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
are not we don't encourage it that they
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
go to override a special need trust but
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
actually they work in conjunction with
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
them because the money's in a special
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
need trust and and hypothetically
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
speaking may actually fund the able
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
account um and once the money is in the
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
account the individual with a
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
disability can spend the money on
 
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
qualified disability expenses what we
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
refer to as a qde and typically a qde an
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
expense has a disability expense is
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
related to the disability and it looks
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
to enhance quality of life it is a
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
incredible full list of um items that
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
are under QD and it and it has a very
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
broad application uh personal support
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
services food um technology education
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
there is just a host and one of and
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
again for this um committee housing so
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
housing expenses be it be it a mortgage
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
be it a rent be It Whatever whatever the
 
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh utility bills whatever whatever the
 
00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:27.799 align:start position:0%
individual is paying for housing if they
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
have an
 
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
account um it can they can then pay
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
those expenses there's also investment
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
options which I will turn over to the
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
state treasurer to discuss um because
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
again this is I should have said also
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
and this is really within the Wheelhouse
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
of our uh State Treasurer um able
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
savings plans were fashioned against
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
College savings plans so College savings
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
have been around for years um Advocates
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
as a story was told to me going back to
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
2014 and before essentially went to the
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
went to the feds and say well if we can
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
do this for other children and we can
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
say for college why can't we do the
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
similar for individuals with disability
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
so with that uh Monica will will'll go
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
over the ex um Investments thanks Doc
 
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
and um so I would just to highlight uh a
 
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
few things so I I agree with with chak
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
enable account is a very powerful
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
account uh for individuals with
 
00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
disabilities it just uh um provides the
 
00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:29.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity to save um funds um and the
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
earnings grow taxfree if they're used
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
for qualified disability expenses
 
00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:36.919 align:start position:0%
including housing which is what is being
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
um uh studied here as part of this
 
00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
committee so it is an incredible account
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
um as as Chuck um mentioned is a game
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
changer um so so individuals with
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
abilities are able to save uh they could
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
use it as a saving account or as a
 
00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:54.519 align:start position:0%
checking account they could uh receive
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
uh their paycheck in there uh or it
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
could be used as a different vehicle
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
depending on how they want to use it it
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
could be for uh daily expenses or it
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
could be even to uh save for retirement
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
if that's how they want to utilize it
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
and so the options provided for
 
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
Investments are really uh the individual
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
and the family probably have to think
 
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:16.039 align:start position:0%
about what is the purpose of the account
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
is it to help the individual where daily
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
daily needs or is it to think about
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
their future so the Investments need to
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
really be in line with those thoughts uh
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
you know with the age of the the individ
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
idual with the purpose of the savings um
 
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
but the options that we provide with the
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
empal aable plan are are really great
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
options I mean it really um is um right
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
now the the plan has um uh seven um type
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
of uh options strategies it could go
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
from aggressive again depending on the
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
the type of objective that the
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
individual and the family would like to
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
save or or again conservative so they
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
can use it for their everyday expens so
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh the option is there the ability to
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
choose and to design um um something
 
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
really powerful for the individual and
 
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
the family is is is is definitely there
 
00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:11.799 align:start position:0%
um and as Chuck mentioned before this is
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
um you know similar to uh a college SS
 
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
account is has been um proven that a
 
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:21.519 align:start position:0%
college SS account has helped many many
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
students and family say for college over
 
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
time um and and so this could definitely
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
do the same thing it could definitely
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
create um you know wealth and and again
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
it could do both it could just provide
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
and assist the individuals and the
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
families or could you know help them
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
provide wealth without jaian the
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
benefits that they receive um so at a
 
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
high level again you know right now we
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
have seven options to invest there will
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
be uh soon there are plans to add one
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
more which is this is what we discuss
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
when we meet with the national a
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
Alliance uh the 19 States get together
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
to decide what type of Investments we're
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
going to have this plan and that is
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
essentially reviewed on a regular basis
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh so the oversight and the um you know
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
fedu share responsibility that all of
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
these states are part of this this
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
Consortium um you know we really uh
 
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
invested in this in this work and in
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
this account so
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
um other than that I mean again a high
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
level is an easy the enabl account is
 
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
very easy to open with only
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
$25 um uh funds can also be rolled over
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
from if there is an consistent um
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
fighton account that perhaps was saved
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
and wasn't fully utilized funds can come
 
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
also as a contribution um Chuck
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that the the yearly
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
contribution is 18 18,000 so that goes
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
with the gift um um that's that's
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
related to the tax uh code so for
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
example in this this year it's 18,000
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
but next year next year is going to be
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
19,000 so that is adjusted um uh by the
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
IRS every year
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that's um essentially
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to highlight um there's a
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
checking account that could be that is
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
part of this plan um is a definitely an
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
easy way to also um utilize the funds
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
once they're in the account um a debit
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
card is also part of this you know they
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
have the option to choose for a debit
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
card or a checking account so it has
 
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
again has options flexibility for the
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who own these accounts and
 
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
um turn it over to you no I think I and
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
I will tell I just have aate from my
 
00:31:32.629 --> 00:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
position it truly is a very fortunate
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
situation that the way the legislature
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
fashioned able New Hampshire's able
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
savings you have the treasurer and you
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
have the executive director working hand
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
in hand and I will tell you especially
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the Investments and
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
Monica her predecessor very invested in
 
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919 align:start position:0%
this program um for the State of New
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because because because the
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
power for the individual is in it it
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
truly is uh remarkable I'll also point
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
out and again what we've seen happen so
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
in 2026 right now I said age of
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
Eligibility is 26 that is going up to 46
 
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
oh okay in
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
2026 another big change uh that's known
 
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
as the able age adjustment act so I
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
think it's January of 26 um that's going
 
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
to open the door to many individuals um
 
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
we see that with um post-traumatic
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
stress TBI uh things that may actually
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know incidences that may happen
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
after the age of
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
26 um as Monica had also said um you can
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
use it as an investment account and you
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
can use it as an everyday account and
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
that that's really I would say is the
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
benefits here um again special needs
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
trusts have their place um but for an
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
individual to have a debit card to have
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
a checking account and to be able to
 
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
have that freedom to make his or her own
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
decision what they're spending the
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
expenses on um it it truly is remarkable
 
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
so that again that's the the NH aable
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
plan at a very high level I I hope it
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
helps and we're more than happy to
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
assist okay are you are you um would you
 
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
like to would you be able to take some
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
questions oh absolutely thank you okay
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
does do anyone have any questions uh
 
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.149 align:start position:0%
does do anyone have any questions uh
representative

00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
lontine um what would the advantages
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
what are the specific advantages to
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
having an able account versus having a
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
family member just keep a savings
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
account for that person
 
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
like could you explain that it's a great
 
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
question um and I would answer it this
 
00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
way uh so the benefit of the in if if
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
you'd like I'll go ahead and we can go
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
back and forth we I'm just gonna say I
 
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
speak that way because
 
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
um uh in in our family's case um the my
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
stepdaughter would not be able to manage
 
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
the account on her own but I realize
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
that many with people with disabilities
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
of course can right but um how to how to
 
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
it work to their advantage yeah it's a
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
great question so the benefit of open an
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
enable account is that if the individual
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
is receiving needs-based
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
benefits the
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
SSI and or Medicaid or the housing
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
benefits When the individual is examined
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
by those entities to see whether or not
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
they qualify the money's in the account
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
are not looked at so that's where the
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
threshold comes in the $2,000
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
traditionally anything in and I say this
 
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
because I I know that there are so many
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
people behind me that know this
 
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
firsthand when you go over that 2000
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
family members were had to make a
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
decision and I will and I'm gonna go one
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
step further this was not unique to New
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this was across the country so
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
it's not I mean I I say that because
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
what individuals did and we've heard the
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
stories we'll use a grandmother if a
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
grandmother was going to give a gift
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
well maybe you shouldn't or if you do
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
give the gift we have to spend it that's
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
the old spend down we have to you know
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
ensure that it doesn't go into that
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
bucket that that can be looked at so
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's that if did you want me to go on
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
if if an individual can't manage the
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
account um there is what is ref so if
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
the person um is not legally competent
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
if there's a guardian involved the
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
guardian can open the account for and
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
and manage it for the individual we we
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
see that in certain situations where the
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
Office of Public Guardian can open the
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
account on behalf and and that that
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
qualifies um and um also if the person
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
is able to open up the account that
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
person can name under a POA under the
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
power of attorney someone who can work
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
with them to manage manage that account
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
yeah a followup go ahead yeah I no I
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
understand that part of it but like some
 
00:35:58.109 --> 00:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
if someone set up a savings account
 
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
specifically for some the individual not
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
in their name they can like likewise
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
right um hide that money from from being
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
held against the individual but I was
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
wondering what are the other like any
 
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.790 align:start position:0%
wondering what are the other like any
other

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.550 align:start position:0%
other
specific

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
um tax or technical
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
advantages to this account versus just a
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
a savings account held in someone else's
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
name yeah so uh regarding the tax that's
 
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
definitely a key point and um that is
 
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what I was um mentioning earlier
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
um if you're able to save money in this
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
able account the earnings uh will grow
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
taxfree again if you used the funds for
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
disability expenses compared to a a
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
regular savings account the person will
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
pay taxes um regardless of how they use
 
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
the funds but the benefits so two two
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
huge benefits again it protects the
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
assets uh can be under the the the
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
beneficiary name the person with a
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
disability and also the tax implications
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
at the feral level are are really
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
important thank
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
from go ahead go
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
ahead um yeah when I first saw the
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
brochure that um the disability had to
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
have an onset by age 26 that left leaves
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of people out and 46 is much
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
better um but why have that age limit at
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
all when you think of all the seniors
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
who are struggling and perhaps trying to
 
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.750 align:start position:0%
who are struggling and perhaps trying to
save

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
save
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
money um that they also risk losing
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
their benefits I know you didn't write
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
the initial legislation but what are
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
your thoughts about that yeah I mean
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
honestly you know from the from our
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
perspective if an individual has a
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
disability you know greater access
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
greater accessibility and you know
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
that's why when we saw
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
the able age adjustment act came about
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
um it for lack of a better term we knew
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
that that was huge um you know the
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
veterans that are coming back yeah um
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
over 26 and you know I would defer to
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
monik on this you may know this and
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
because because we do get the question
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
how did they come up with 26 at the
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
federal level um and I think it had like
 
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
essentially like a I would assume like a
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached to it and they had
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
to do whatever it had to to get this
 
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
thing passed so to speak in 2014 I I I
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
will probably uh say that I don't know
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
the details exactly why the the age of
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
26 but typically the federal government
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
obviously has to do with the fiscal
 
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
impact so they obviously whatever
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
benefits they're going to provide um
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
they they're also looking at their
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
checkbook so I think that's that's part
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
of the reason so there was a lot of
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
advocacy to change the law to be able to
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
increase the age um knowing that you
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
know how much money was going to cost
 
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
the F government for that change so it
 
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
has to do with uh how much how much much
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
taxes all right well um there aren't any
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
other questions I have a couple um at at
 
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
this time how close are you to um
 
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
capacity on how many people um could
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this program how much
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
room for growth do you
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
have we have a lot of room for growth um
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
if we were able to benefit every single
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
individual and every single family uh in
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh we we should be able to
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely definitely that's the hope
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you consumers and
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
Advocates and the entire and again I
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
know it sounds somewhat of a cliche but
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
we all get it in this room New Hampshire
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
does do it differently I mean many of
 
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
The Advocates that have spoken here that
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
are in the room today parents they will
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
get the word out but obviously that
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
we're always monik and I and our staffs
 
00:39:58.349 --> 00:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
are always doing the best we can to
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
ensure that uh individuals know about uh
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
the NHA plan and we have very robust
 
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
social media um we do whatever we can to
 
00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:09.640 align:start position:0%
get that info out my other question is
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
um would you feel comfortable about
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
giving us like an anonymous case study
 
00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
of how someone used this money to do
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
something to regarding housing do you um
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
yeah regarding housing you
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
know I I'd like to get back to you on
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
that May um
 
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
however I can give you um we we know
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
that it is head and again this is just
 
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
from memory and you know when we were
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
again when I say we um things have
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
changed so much over the years when we
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
when we first launched in 2017 we were
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
canvas in the state with inperson
 
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
meetings um that's changed a bit you
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
know now that people on understandable
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
and and they're they're enrolling on
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
their own and and that's wonderful um
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
but just when we look at qualified dis
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
ility expenses Transportation was huge
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
um for individual we've got that back
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
individuals who have bought automobiles
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
um as a result of you know that basic
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
living expenses because again and I and
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
I say this I always say this upfront
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
special needs trusts are very important
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
um but again it's a trust so there's
 
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
going to be from what I understand
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
there's certain reporting requirements
 
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
and as a trustee a little bit different
 
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
with able accounts because you're able
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
to actually get in there and handle it
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
and spended on that basic living expense
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
um you know there are individuals who
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
have bought and I remember this from
 
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
being on the road just uh for basic
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
living expenses if an
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
individual um if it was an individual at
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum um disorder that
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
individual May bought whatever they
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
needed to ensure that they were
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
regulated and that could be a a personal
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
trampoline and I know that the
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
trampoline in and of itself may seem
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
small but it was a big deal to the
 
00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.470 align:start position:0%
small but it was a big deal to the
parents

00:41:59.470 --> 00:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
um any uh technology
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
education um we've heard those stories
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
as far as housing we we again just this
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
is from memory I'm fairly certain that
 
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
individuals who had a special need trust
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
funded the able account and then they
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
actually paid their rent out of the able
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
account which again they were able to
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
pay the check over um to the landlord
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
but if it's okay chair I can um get back
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
to and see if we can give you a few case
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
studies and to to see how they were
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
actually um utilized that would be that
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
would be terrific I'd like to include
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
those in the report um does anyone have
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
yella feel like this is a little bit
 
00:42:47.069 --> 00:42:47.079 align:start position:0%
kind of in the weeds and out maybe
 
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
this um the topic that we're covering
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm just curious
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned the difference in
 
00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.030 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned the difference in
reporting

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
requirements how if they have a check or
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
they have a a
 
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
a a ATM card how are you guys managing
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
that that as far as making sure that
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's a qualified expense um are they
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
having to submit receipts and stuff like
 
00:43:24.549 --> 00:43:24.559 align:start position:0%
that is because like generally what I'm
 
00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:26.559 align:start position:0%
thinking of is like FSA accounts you get
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
a card and you go to the grocery store
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a there's specific labels
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
that say like this will qualify this
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
won't qualify kind of a thing and it
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
won't even spend the money if you don't
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
um but like a check would not have that
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
requirement or uh and and you have
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
things on the list like you know a video
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
game right the the video game
 
00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.750 align:start position:0%
game right the the video game
maybe

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh exercise or not how do you how are
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
you guys termining all of that just
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
curious I go yeah and and what I can
 
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
share is um so uh folks don't have to
 
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
submit receipts and it's sort of like a
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh folks are recommended to keep track
 
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
of their expenses so in case they're
 
00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
audited because again this has to do
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
with um you know in the case of the IRS
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
you you are subject as a taxpayer uh to
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
be audited so if by chance you are lucky
 
00:44:29.549 --> 00:44:29.559 align:start position:0%
enough to be picked that you need to be
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
able to provide documentation first of
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
all that you qualify for enable account
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
and then also that your your expenses
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
were qualified um so it is recommended
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
that you keep track the system or the
 
00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
type of for example if a debit car is
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
used a lot of times the actual um um
 
00:44:50.549 --> 00:44:50.559 align:start position:0%
expense will will show up in the record
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
as um you know the type of expense that
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
is that you know what the person bought
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
with that money uh the check checking
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
account the same um
 
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
um so again it really is recommended to
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
to to keep records uh to to be able to
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
prove that you you know those those
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
expenses are uh qualified um expenses uh
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing that if by chance a
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
person um spends money on items are not
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
qualified um the account owner will be
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
subject to a 10% penalty and also um um
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
we'll have to pay the tax for for that
 
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
amount of money so it has some
 
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
consequences if it's not again it is to
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
provide the benefits the tax benefit but
 
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
um in the event if it's not used for
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
that purpose there are those you know
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
that's the consequence to pay the tax on
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
that money and also a 10%
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
penalty yeah well
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
stated um what what we have heard
 
00:45:53.319 --> 00:45:54.549 align:start position:0%
stated um what what we have heard
representative

00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:54.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
in we've been at it for a while it's a
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
legitimate question you're right because
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
we'll hear that in field what do I do do
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
I keep the receipts what if I'm hited
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean at the end of the day you
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
should um I always equate it to the IRS
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
as moniker had stated if I say I gave x
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
amount as a charitable donation keep the
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
receipt or keep your cancel check or or
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
whatever so that's that that's a
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
necessity and we also get questions when
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
we're presenting um well would this be a
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
qualified disability expense
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
well it really is subject Ive um but
 
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
again at the national level being part
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the 19 States taking part in National
 
00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
discussions there has never you know
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
able Accounts at the federal level and
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
and at the state level there's an
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
encouragement to open them what we're
 
00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
not we're not looking to treat it as a
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
penalty or a Draconian we're looking we
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
want this to happen um and I think that
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
really was the legislative intent and
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's not to downplay what you just said
 
00:46:56.589 --> 00:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
because you're right I mean at the end
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
of the day you want to know but we
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
highly advise the individuals um is the
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
expense related to the disability that's
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
number one and does it look to benefit
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
health and dependence um of the
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
individual so once you apply it can be
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
referred to as like a two-prong test
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
that that can be um you know you have to
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
look at it I don't you know there are
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
some that I you know I I use this as an
 
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
example an individual with a disability
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
is going to um a friend's birthday party
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
and he doesn't drive but he takes an
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
Uber well the Uber the way I look at it
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
is a qualified disability expense
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
related to the disability inur to the
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
benefit and however the birthday gift
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
that he is giving to the individual if
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
it's a cash gift that's that's not going
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
to fall within the qde but again it's
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
very subjective we've never again and I
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
where we where like most state agencies
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
we're very Hands-On as the legislature
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
is I have never heard of a story where
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
an expense was either questioned or
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
audited and that's a good thing um but
 
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
again I think it goes to the I'm hoping
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
it goes to the legislative intent when
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
we look back at why we have them but
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%

cognitive or mental health
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities housing stability is a
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
vital social determinant that
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
contributes to one's overall health and

well-being and access to affordable safe
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
accessible housing is a common concern
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
that we hear from those we serve today I
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
would like to speak specifically um to
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
highlight the impact that the lack of
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
housing has on one of the most
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations in New Hampshire
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
individuals with Developmental and
 
00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities for over 35
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
years Easter Seals has served this
 
00:50:43.789 --> 00:50:43.799 align:start position:0%
population and we're currently the
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
largest private provider of
 
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
Developmental services in New Hampshire
 
00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:50.839 align:start position:0%
serving 243 adults on an annual basis
 
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
the primary model for providing
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
residential services to this population
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
is a shared Living Model where agency
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh contract with an individual couple or
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
family to provide Room and Board and
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
Care to an individual in a private home
 
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
in the contractor's home while this
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
model has worked out beautifully for so
 
00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:11.559 align:start position:0%
many people some people living their
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
lifetime with with the contracted family
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
for others um it hasn't worked out as
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
well um it has led to homelessness
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
emergency placement and unnecessary
 
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations Easter Seals currently
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
serves 90 people and share living homes
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
and in looking at our average placements
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
about 5.2 years so on average people are
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
moving every 5 years families are
 
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
looking for a choice in the model of of
 
00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
Residential Service delivery um they
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
want a model that offers more permanent
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
housing one that you can stay in the
 
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
same community and age in
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
place in an effort to increase housing
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
options for this population there are
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
groups of families all over the state
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
I've met with several of them there's
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
also a a developer who are really
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
working to create permanent um Housing
 
00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:07.799 align:start position:0%
Solutions they have to raise money
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
privately um taking years to get the
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
money to secure the property to renovate
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
the property also dealing with some
 
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory barri barriers um meanwhile
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
aging families are struggling to provide
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%

uh in addition Easter Seals it it sorry
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
it should just not be this hard for
 
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:34.119 align:start position:0%

reached an alltime high in New Hampshire
 
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
um we we are experiencing rents for a

00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
the individuals is $1,400 for all
 
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
expenses the Bureau of Developmental
 
00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
services does have access to State
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
funding to bridge the funding Gap
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
however there's not sufficient funding
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
at this time that funding is not
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
available to every person in this model
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
of care and there's a wait list for
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
anyone new it's just not a sustainable
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
business model for private providers and
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
as a result many providers have stopped
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
providing this level of care our
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
inability to support New Hampshire
 
00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:32.839 align:start position:0%
providers to develop and maintain
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
housing has led to costly out ofate
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
placements currently East um New
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has approximately 50
 
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
individuals in out ofate placements a
 
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
scenario which is not only expensive but
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
very difficult on the individuals and
 
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.390 align:start position:0%
very difficult on the individuals and
their

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
families recently um there was a round
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
of arpa funding that has provided
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
startup resources for some private
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
providers to develop new residential
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
options in New Hampshire which is
 
00:54:55.839 --> 00:54:56.910 align:start position:0%
options in New Hampshire which is
amazing

00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
however the long-term fiscal
 
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
sustainability for the housing isn't
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
clear I urge a study um committee to
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
examine um and review potential funding
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
streams and regul Regulatory barriers to
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
ensure that all New Hampshire residents
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
especially those with the greatest needs
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
have access to Affordable permanent
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
housing in their home state of New
 
00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:20.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you thank you does
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
anyone have
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
questions representative yella first and
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
um maybe there I'm just trying to get
 
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
some clarification on some of those
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
numbers that you were throwing out um
 
00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:49.110 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:56.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
non for services yeah for non Housing
 
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
Services um and then you said
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
$1,400 correct so and and so I'm
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if that 1400 where that where
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
that $1,400 is coming that is that from
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
the people so basically that there's an
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
824 standard of need it's called um and
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
so when you back out the food of 350 a
 
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
month from the 824 it leaves like
 
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
$474 per person times three yeah times
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
three is the 1400 rough times three
 
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
three most of the it was based on a
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
three person home sorry okay so
 
00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
you're okay sorry
 
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
so okay so you're you giving me the
 
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
number the amount of
 
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
money you you also in your statement
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
said that you're housing between one and
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
four people correct in a room or
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
in a in a house I mean t typically there
 
00:57:01.789 --> 00:57:01.799 align:start position:0%
are three three bedrooms typically so
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
there are some some programs where
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
there's one person um that's staff 247
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
but typically we we have three bedroom
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
homes okay so and can I can ahead thanks
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
um so I'm trying to a little bit
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
understand how your program works so
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's you're you're renting a house
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
house mhm and then you are asking for
 
00:57:33.549 --> 00:57:33.559 align:start position:0%
applications for people that want to
 
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
come live in the house and then you uh
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
you would be offering services to all of
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
the people that are part of that house
 
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
um and that would be kind of like the
 
00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:52.039 align:start position:0%
facility corre and and then you rinse
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
and repeat you do that again and again
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
like yeah these are Community Based long
 
00:57:58.109 --> 00:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
term supports and services homes
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
typically three bedrooms correct we are
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
in rental properties across the state
 
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
we're three individuals who have common
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
support needs or living together and we
 
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
provide services built to the Medicaid
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
waiver and then where we're struggling
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
is just the r and board and housing
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:21.039 align:start position:0%
increased okay and so you said that
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
there's a um
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
247 uh services and so that made me
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
think of like you have someone there
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
247 or you have like houses around like
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
a common structure where they could go
 
00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
service people 247 so how does the 247
 
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
so these are homes um that are in the
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
community um and the house is like
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
staffed with shift staff in in a
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
specific house located in the community
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
um and and the individuals are accessing
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
their community so each home is a unique
 
00:59:00.029 --> 00:59:00.039 align:start position:0%
program it's not a campus um they're
 
00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
they're living in their home
 
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
communities okay so the the people that
 
00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
are all living in the
 
00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.150 align:start position:0%
are all living in the
[Music]

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
same same uh
 
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
structure um are you trying to get them
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
with similar needs so that they can H
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
utilize the same Personnel or you have
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
multiple like one Personnel per person
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
247 no it's not 101 247 the support
 
00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
needs are really designed based on you
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
know someone's individual service plan
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um and typically they shared staff
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
like there might be one staff overnight
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
um for the three individuals typically
 
00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
the service needs are are similar um so
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
either people might have like you know a
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
lot of um medical needs and need for you
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
know accessible housing maybe increased
 
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
nursing um and it's shared Staffing okay
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
and it's based on the service plan in
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
there and their need their individual
 
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
needs and you have um
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
n 90 people so we have 90 people in our
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
in our shared living homes which is the
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
foster care foster care like adult
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
foster care
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
homes okay um so that's a different
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
different category than this one this
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
this one how many homes you have we have
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
21 certified residents right right okay
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
I write that down 25 with 50 B with 57
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
BS that's this not okay y thank you very
 
01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
much sorry just it's complicated we're
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
complicated representative L you had a
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
question yeah I'm trying to I'm trying
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
to understand it all too um but how does
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
it made sense to me I'm sorry
 
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
that the residential service
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
programs how do they differ from what we
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
used to know as the group
 
01:01:01.029 --> 01:01:01.039 align:start position:0%
home um and did Easter Seals have group
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
homes um we we didn't start out having
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
resid uh group homes back in the day we
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
we were later to the residential service
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
Market um I think what's changed over
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
time is really the size of the home as
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
well as like the involvement in the
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
community um and and making sure that
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
the the services provided are really
 
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.309 align:start position:0%
the the services provided are really
promoting

01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
promoting
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
inclusion uh employment um and being
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
belonging in the in the community I
 
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
time I guess my question is
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
um well we had an incident in Manchester
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
over the summer where there was um an
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
individual living in a a placement
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
similar to this and he kept leaving the
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
building and um the neighbor you know
 
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
showing up in the neighbor's yards and
 
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't know him and they you know
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
his behaviors were um they felt
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
threatened by him so do you get a lot of
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
push back um in the neighborhoods where
 
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
you're trying to place these individuals
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
and um you this is a great question and
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
sadly yes um we haven't opened a new
 
01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
home for a while but um often you know
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
it it's it's scary for Neighbors because
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
they don't know what they don't know um
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
you know we take great care in citing
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
and where we where we have these homes
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
so while we are in the community we
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
really think about the neighbors the
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
neighbor relations and you know how to
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
promote people in like valued social
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
roles but there definitely still is some
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
concern with Neighbors in terms of you
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
know um not having these types of homes
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
in their neighborhood I also think you
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
know you need to take great care in
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
screening um the clinical needs of of
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
the of the residents and ensuring that
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
um you have the Staffing support the
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
clinical backup the clinical support and
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
the backup to respond um to
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately to behavioral situations
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
that might
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
arise okay I guess the other question
 
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
that I would ask is that um my
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
assumption is that you're using existing
 
01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:26.039 align:start position:0%
buildings for these um um for these uh
 
01:03:30.269 --> 01:03:30.279 align:start position:0%
placements for folks do you find that um
 
01:03:33.549 --> 01:03:33.559 align:start position:0%
there are barriers um for the kinds of
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
care that individuals with disabilities
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
might need because of the fact that
 
01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
you're using existing buildings um yes
 
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
so we we're in rental properties for
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
most of most of the the homes that we
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
have um and I think when it comes to
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
accessibility that's the biggest barrier
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
we see so for folks who need fully
 
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
accessible shower
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
um you know lifts um ceiling lifts um
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
there are not a lot of rental properties
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
that accommodate those those folks um
 
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
needs um and just just to follow up you
 
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
you mostly have rental properties is
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
that because um purchasing is properties
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
is too expensive or it
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
creates um certain complications that
 
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
make it harder for you to deliver
 
01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.349 align:start position:0%
make it harder for you to deliver
services

01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we we um it I mean the housing
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
market is really expensive right now um
 
01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
and it has been so we have chosen to
 
01:04:36.029 --> 01:04:36.039 align:start position:0%
rent Overby just due to the
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
cost and the funding streams to cover
 
01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
you know all of the when you own a house
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
the repairs and and the ongoing upkeep
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
it's just really not a lot of funding to
 
01:04:45.039 --> 01:04:50.029 align:start position:0%
it's just really not a lot of funding to
cover

01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.599 --> 01:04:59.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
so for I'm very surprised that you rent
 
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
um because
 
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
that makes me think that you know as as
 
01:05:16.589 --> 01:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
the um the rents rise and and
 
01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
be it leaves you open to not being able
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
to have those 21 facilities right um
 
01:05:34.269 --> 01:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
especially when like the you know the
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
landlord no longer wants to to uh
 
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
continue the renew a lease or something
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
like that right there it seems like
 
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.549 align:start position:0%
like that right there it seems like
there's

01:05:45.549 --> 01:05:45.559 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
um a lot
 
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.150 align:start position:0%
um a lot
of

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
variability in that
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
model um do are you a aware of anyone
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
any other groups that do a similar model
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
that purchase or are are are you pretty
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
much the only one there are and in this
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
recent round of arpa funding um which
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
was specifically designed for new beds
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
we were approved to purchase one of our
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
homes so we are purchasing one home um
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
we're also renovating another home that
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
we we own so we are moving to more of a
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
um owned model um for that very
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
reason yes it seems like fixed cost like
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
being able to have a 30-year mortgage or
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
whatever like that you could have
 
01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
certain amount of no you know obviously
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
the repairs would be variable but the uh
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
the rent essentially could be foren in a
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
uh longer range um have you had to close
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
any places because of increased rent
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
kind of priced you out of the $1,400
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
that you I we've been subsidizing it um
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
you know and the bureau has worked hard
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
to you know um to access the state funds
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
so to help bridge that so that's that's
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
helped us um we have not closed any due
 
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
to that um but we are evaluating our our
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
ability to continue to provide that
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
level of care um so and that's where the
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
ownership is starting to like the you
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
know especially when we got the arpa
 
01:07:23.309 --> 01:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
funds to be able to purchase um you know
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
the property that we have in in we New
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
greatly um I would like to follow up
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
again if you're
 
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
fine okay um
 
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
the I also have
 
01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.750 align:start position:0%
the I also have
some

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
some questions about
 
01:07:53.309 --> 01:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
the uh you said that the neighbors as
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
far as not not being happy that you're
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
going to move in or something but it it
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
would still be a residential building
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
and the building is already existing
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
right so how do the Neighbors come
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
involved at all right you're you're just
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
renting a building from someone and then
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's essentially like three roommates
 
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
living in a building so how do the
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
neighbors have an impact on you so
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes the neighbors will um
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
hear about us about who's moving in I'm
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
not sure how um and you know once we're
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
there there's three shifts a day so it's
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
a little different than other you know
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
their neighbors um people might see
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities and draw
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
conclusions um so and then at times
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
we've gone to different towns when we've
 
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
opened it just be good partners to say
 
01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
we're opening up um and sometimes that
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
has opened up um you know some issues
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
Y and those can you specify those issues
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
did they do they want to um Zone it like
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
like say that you have to be in a
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
commercial property or something like
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
that or how how are they creating
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
barriers um so when I this is a while
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
ago but yes we had some issues with
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
people saying oh no this is not this is
 
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
not residential this is a business you
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
know this is and you know we're
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
but we're we're not we push back it's a
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
residential program three individual
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
three unrelated individuals live there
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
and eventually we we get you know we get
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
through but it it just isn't always the
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
experience okay does anyone have any
 
01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.110 align:start position:0%
experience okay does anyone have any
other

01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
questions go right ahead I think this um
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
based on your model it seems like you're
 
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
um not required to be licensed in each
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
of these you're essentially utilizing
 
01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:05.790 align:start position:0%
the uh the certification model of the
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:07.390 align:start position:0%
the uh the certification model of the
[Music]

01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
um the lure requirements of this of New
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we do have two properties
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
that are licensed if it's over three
 
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
beds it needs to it needs to be
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
licensed so if there's over three beds
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
it has to be licensed so we have two
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
programs is that is that because you
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
told them that you could potentially
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
have a fourth person or because there's
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
literally like four bedrooms and even if
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
you only kept three people in there all
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
the time then it would not be considered
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
it if we had three people there it would
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
be certified but we have four
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
individuals living there okay so and
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
those are homes that are specially
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
designed for people who need full
 
01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
accessibility um and there's four four
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
bedrooms you know full um Rule and
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
shower and lifts in the ceilings and you
 
01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
know everything that they need to live
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
you um yeah so if I could just follow up
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
on yeah this line of questioning um
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
these you've created a a facility for
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
four people um that it sounds like it
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
was probably pretty expensive to make
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
sure you could have the lifts and the
 
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
bathrooms an additional expense and so
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
forth um what was the limiting factor to
 
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
four people because you know potentially
 
01:11:44.669 --> 01:11:44.679 align:start position:0%
maybe you could have six people living
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
in a facility where you've invested so
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
much in um I mean this is a a
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
residential home so there like that was
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
repurposed the landlord actually did all
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
of the renovations um so there just
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't six bedrooms
 
01:12:02.669 --> 01:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
okay but the um the fact that you could
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
put in
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
a an extra person in there made the um
 
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
made the finances work out better
 
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
because you were getting income from
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
another person or I mean the finances
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
don't really work out but um but I mean
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
I think it helps with you know the
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
Staffing Resources on the service
 
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
side and again it's just those beds that
 
01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
can can support individuals who need
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
fully accessible housing is they're
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
rare this is thank you so much for
 
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
coming this is very interesting so so um
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
I assume that the four
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
um four
 
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
bedroom place that you've now have
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
licensed and all of this this um work
 
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
installed you're you're renting we are
 
01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.110 align:start position:0%
installed you're you're renting we are
and

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
how how do
 
01:13:06.239 --> 01:13:08.030 align:start position:0%
how how do
you

01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
decide uh you know that that you're
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
going to try and invest that time and
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
money in such a in a situation like like
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
that rental like how do you make that
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
choice and is that is that something
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
is is difficult or made harder because
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
it's renting um or do you guys kind of
 
01:13:36.669 --> 01:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
like the the landlord invested a bunch
 
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
into it also so you guys are kind of uh
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
tied together at the hip in those ca in
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
this case uh the two cases the landlord
 
01:13:47.709 --> 01:13:47.719 align:start position:0%
um received some grant funding to to
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
renovate the property um for us to build
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
or buy something equivalent would it
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
would be cost prohibit
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay interesting thank
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
you okay well thank you so much for
 
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320 align:start position:0%

you all right next up on the agenda is
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%

and Madam chair members of the study

Alyssa marglin I serve as director of
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
housing action New Hampshire thank you
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
for your work on this committee I was at
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
your inaugural meeting and have caught
 
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
up on um the other presentations that
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
you've had what I thought I would do for
 
01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
you today is um talk with you about
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
policy proposals that have made their
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
way way through the legislature and
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
things that are likely on the horizon as
 
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
you consider um what your study
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee um might recommend to the
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
legislature moving
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
forward um I know that you uh dug deep
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
into the challenges of rental subsidies
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
um you had a really uh robust
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
conversation with New Hampshire housing
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
about the housing Choice Voucher Program
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
you learned about the long waiting lists
 
01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh about um um some of the priorities
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
put on those waiting lists um uh and I
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
know Senator rardy was a gas to learn
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
that you get a preference if you have um
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh a a fatal Illness but you're likely
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
to wait for two years um and I guess I
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
have um some thoughts about that
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
conversation that you had on the
 
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
committee I'll share that I think at the
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
federal level on the ADV see that we do
 
01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
um with our Congressional Delegation and
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
our Congressional Delegation is all have
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
proven um to be very interested in
 
01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:07.719 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with solutions to our
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and have weighed in
 
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
everywhere they they can but I will say
 
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
more broadly one of the
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
challenges uh is that um rental
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
subsidies make up over 90% of Hud's
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
budget now and that is creating just
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
budgetary overall budgetary challenges
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
and um undermining the likelihood that
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
they will add additional vouchers so I I
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that we will see a real push
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
to increase vouchers that come to the
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
states through Housing and Urban
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
Development I do think that there is
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
some momentum around um bringing back in
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
some form the emergency rental
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
assistance program that we had during
 
01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
arpa and obviously it'll depend on the
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
direction of the next Administration but
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
that proved a really important tool to
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
many states and there there is some
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
momentum there um what I I do want to
 
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
contemplate though is um other state
 
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
Solutions around Bridges to Section 8
 
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
and um I think um you heard the success
 
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
of the housing Bridge subsidy program
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
for people with severe and persistent
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
mental illness um and that resulted
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
um uh in the settle Olstead settlement
 
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
um uh during the Obama Administration
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
with the state of New Hampshire that
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
does create a subsidy for that
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
population and they work closely with
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing and I think um Mr
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
mlen told you about the 811 program um
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
so essentially a a state uh temporary
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
subsidy until you access uh until you're
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
able bble to work through the the
 
01:17:58.510 --> 01:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
waiting list on Section 8 so something
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
something to consider there I want to
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
speak again about the need for more
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
advocacy um to the Department of Health
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
and Human Services to finally finally
 
01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
operationalize the new Supportive
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
Housing Medicaid benefit the legislature
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
directed the Department of Health and
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
Human Services to apply for this um
 
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
state plan amendment in
 
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
2019 um CMS approved the Supportive
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
Housing Medicaid benefit in 2022 and we
 
01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
are still waiting for the Department to
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
operationalize this this would cover
 
01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing Services for um uh
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
AOC accessing housing and um and also uh
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
to uh Ser ongoing Services needed to
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
sustain housing um the department did
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
announce the credentialing opportunity
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
to providers in the summer of this year
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
but um it is being held up again um so I
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
think uh more advocacy from the
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
legislature directed to the department
 
01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
to operationalize this benefit is is
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
needed at this
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
time finally I I'll jump to the capital
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
subsidies um again you learned a lot
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
from Mr mclen and learning about how
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
below market rate capital is attractive
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
to developers and that those developers
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
pass on those savings they're getting by
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
not going in traditional debt into
 
01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
affordability and that they are often
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
partnered with either housing Choice
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
voucher acceptance or Project based
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
vouchers what I want to um uh advocate
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
for is increasing the overall um
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
resource to the affordable housing fund
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
think you've seen this in a lot of um
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
the candidates plans uh who are running
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
for governor um and uh I do want to
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
caution against designating funding to a
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
certain population and I say this from
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
experience um one of the first
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
Appropriations I secured as a uh new
 
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
director at housing action New Hampshire
 
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
was designated to people recovering from
 
01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
opioid dis disorders and it proved very
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
difficult um uh developer to to
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
disseminate and allocate
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh it was after that that we started to
 
01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:31.719 align:start position:0%
advocate for flexibility in the fund um
 
01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
developers who serve certain populations
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
are very motivated to serve that
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
population generally and um I I think
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
we've learned that um allowing those
 
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
developers to respond to Market needs
 
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
population needs in a larger more
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
flexible fund is a better policy
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
solution than chopping it up and saying
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
this is for the this population and that
 
01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.590 align:start position:0%
this is for the this population and that
population

01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
um so uh with that I'll I'll say that we
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
have been um advocating for a change in
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tracks car out
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
formula that goes to the affordable
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
housing fund uh we'd think that $5
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
million per year is is really uh
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
insufficient given the crisis um and
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
would like to see that formula changed
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
in the N budget cycle to at least um two
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
times the the current
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
formula and last year when this was
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
proposed although it was an off budget
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
year um it did have a by partisan
 
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
support and it did have support of the
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire realtors in addition to
 
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
housing action New
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I want to also bring up
 
01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
some other state level these are more
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
lwh hanging fruit
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities um I think it's come up
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
the expansion of 79e and what that could
 
01:21:58.030 --> 01:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
provide so we have um uh you know had
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
successful legislation last year to
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
expand this uh uh enable municipalities
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
to offer this benefit um and so I think
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
that uh there could be a willingness to
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
work with that
 
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
tool um and I also think that the
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
Council on housing stability is an
 
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
interesting entity to look at um that
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
has really heightened coordination among
 
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
state agencies and advocates for for
 
01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:25.669 align:start position:0%
state agencies and advocates for for
different

01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
populations and I think it would be
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
helpful to have a member of the
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
disability Community one or two members
 
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
added to the Council on housing
 
01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:37.719 align:start position:0%
stability Council and housing stability
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
was created by executive order by
 
01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
Governor cuno at the start of the
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
pandemic but the legislature codified it
 
01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:47.639 align:start position:0%
um and so it could be amended uh now in
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
statute to add uh additional members to
 
01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:50.750 align:start position:0%
statute to add uh additional members to
the

01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
council um I also want to name another
 
01:22:55.229 --> 01:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
recent um
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh legislative success and that is the
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
launch of the housing Champion program
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
and I believe representative yella you
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
sat on the advisory committee for that
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
program that program was recently
 
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
launched like maybe two weeks ago by
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
business and economic Affairs and
 
01:23:13.629 --> 01:23:13.639 align:start position:0%
announced to municipalities and then um
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
will provide um incentives for
 
01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure dollars through uh
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
designation and recognition as a housing
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
Champion community and there may be an
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with the office of
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh Planning and Development to add
 
01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.470 align:start position:0%
uh Planning and Development to add
criteria

01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
around accessible um design and and
 
01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
other issues um to integrate the needs
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
of uh housing for people with
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
program um finally I want to talk about
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
the need for the state to set more
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable standards at the local level
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
we're often um when we discuss um
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
proposals like uh improving New
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's accessory dwelling unit law
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
or allowing single family Property
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
Owners to turn their um single family
 
01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
into a duplex Triplex or fourplex we're
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
often um find ourselves in a uh age-old
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
policy debate about local control versus
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
State mandates and I don't think it
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be an either or but I do think
 
01:24:25.870 --> 01:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
that the state could say when some when
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
local municipalities have over regulated
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
to the point where they're forcing their
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
own members of their Community to leave
 
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:35.639 align:start position:0%
and so in some cases when a property
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
owner wants to create an accessory
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit for their child with
 
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities they should be allowed to
 
01:24:44.189 --> 01:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
do that by right if a property owner
 
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
wants to create a duplex or Triplex
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
because they want um Support Services in
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
their home they should be allowed to do
 
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
so by right and the state has the
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
ability to set that reasonable standard
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
for our
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
localities um and so um I think you'll
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
likely see um proposals they're already
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
lsrs for next year around um accessory
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit log in um and uh I know
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
parking came up at a recent hearing here
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
and indeed um you know uh representative
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
yella hb400 a bill that you sponsored
 
01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
does do just that where the state says a
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
more reasonable parking standard for
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities is one and a half spaces
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
for multif family 10 units or more but
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
also for studios and
 
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
one-bedrooms that meet the standards of
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
the workforce housing law so some
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
progress and and something to to build
 
01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.350 align:start position:0%
progress and and something to to build
on

01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
there and with that I think I'll
 
01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:46.670 align:start position:0%
conclude and just take your
 
01:25:46.670 --> 01:25:48.629 align:start position:0%
conclude and just take your
[Music]

01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
questions have questions um I I have I
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
have one um I am a huge fan of the the
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
every other Friday calls that New
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing does and um one of the
 
01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
people that you had on was Carmen
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
lorence from
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
lonia and she was talking about how they
 
01:26:10.109 --> 01:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
were trying to build a Supportive
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
Housing structure in lonia on a lot and
 
01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
the problem was now this was Supportive
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
Housing so I'm assuming that you know
 
01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.390 align:start position:0%
Housing so I'm assuming that you know
these

01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
people Pro many of them didn't drive but
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
they couldn't make the project pencil
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
with the amount of parking that the city
 
01:26:29.639 --> 01:26:30.510 align:start position:0%
with the amount of parking that the city
was

01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
requiring um to build this facility so
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
um how often does that happen um so
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
first of all representative thank you
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
for the shout out for housing action New
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's housing matter zooms um and
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for participating in those
 
01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that's why you saw us push so
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
hard on hp400
 
01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
um last year uh and uh if I recall the
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
committee of conference conversation was
 
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
actually representative Sweeney who
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
noted um that he wakes up to that he
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
rents in Salem and that he wakes up to
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
empty parking spots um where he rents uh
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
every day and that frustrated him
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
because that could be that that
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that developable land um
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
would be a a good place for more housing
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
or or business and that requiring you
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
know this this Paving um in a formula
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't align with the community
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
needs didn't make sense so I think the
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
state in that case you know um sets some
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
more reasonable standard um it also in
 
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
hb400 also requires that municipalities
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
accept alternative Parking Solutions so
 
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
you've you've been talking with families
 
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
um and with with tenants uh you know
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
part of our our Rental Community rental
 
01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
population here who doesn't drive so why
 
01:27:59.109 --> 01:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
are we requiring that they have two
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
parking spots per bedroom um that
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense so for some cases now
 
01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities must accept solutions
 
01:28:08.669 --> 01:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
they can challenge um that solution if
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
they don't think it meets needs but now
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh you've opened that door uh through
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
State policy um and I was thinking I
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
know representa St we' talked about
 
01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
bringing um some developers to your
 
01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
committee and so um Lakes Region
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
Community developers was one that I was
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
thinking of uh bringing forward I know
 
01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
you had um a member of their board here
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh recently um who also works for Late
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
swegan Community Services Yeah well yeah
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
this is our this is our our final um
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
meeting before we have to do our um your
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
initial report right but you're doing
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
continue right we will be continuing on
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
for a year we would certainly love to
 
01:28:50.910 --> 01:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
hear from um developers about the
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
challenges that they are facing um
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
anyone have any
 
01:28:59.629 --> 01:28:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
yella thank you for
 
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh your work on um 1400 and and the
 
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
um the housing
 
01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.870 align:start position:0%
um the housing
Champion

01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
um project
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
the I believe in
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
the uh housing Champion rules I mean at
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
least there was the discussion about um
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh kind of mixed mixed use
 
01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.910 align:start position:0%
uh kind of mixed mixed use
um

01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
housing or like housing with businesses
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
in um kind of in the same area or
 
01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
vicinity or even in the same building
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
um and and I don't know if it became
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
part of the rules or not um whether they
 
01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
get points for for having that but it
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
seems from my perspective in the
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've heard in this which
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
obviously came later than the rule
 
01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:15.719 align:start position:0%
setting um it seems like
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
the the access to the
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
by the people with
 
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
disabilities could be a barrier to
 
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
getting getting them kind of out in the
 
01:30:35.109 --> 01:30:35.119 align:start position:0%
community or getting them even to be
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
kind of independent at all um
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
you that was one of the things that kind
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
of like jumped out to me as as in the
 
01:30:55.109 --> 01:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
last few weeks I'm um wondering if um
 
01:30:57.629 --> 01:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
you had any thoughts
 
01:30:57.639 --> 01:30:59.830 align:start position:0%
you had any thoughts
or

01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh insights about
 
01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
um like kind of that those mixed uh use
 
01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
they like the past legislation on it and
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
and if housing Champion if you know
 
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
offand CH housing Champion did anything
 
01:31:26.590 --> 01:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh trying to encourage
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
that um so thank you for the question
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your participation in
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
the housing Champion Advisory Board um I
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
know the rules passed Jael car this
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
summer but I I uh I haven't looked at
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
them in a while so I'd have to look and
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
get back to you representative um I do
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
01:31:49.109 --> 01:31:49.119 align:start position:0%
another um reason that the affordable
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
housing fund is so important to our
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
state is it allows for that creativity
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
so a lot of a lot of federal money comes
 
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
with restrictions on and you you learned
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
a lot about that um but the having um in
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
the capital stack that kind of flexible
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
resource um so if you want to do
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
something like mixed use or if you want
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
part of it to be market rate um uh you
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
can you can do that with the affordable
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
housing fund uh and um you know New
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's had a state Housing Trust
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
Fund since 1988 but it's only in the
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
last couple of budget cycles that we
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
actually started putting any money in it
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
at all the formula for the real estate
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
transfer tax carve out is quite new um
 
01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
and I think um we've learned how
 
01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
valuable it is as we've gotten deeper
 
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
and deeper into the crisis but the
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
formula hasn't changed um and so uh I
 
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
think that that um is just another
 
01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
argument for that but I don't know I
 
01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:54.280 align:start position:0%
would have to look on the housing
 
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
Champions to see and I hear what you're
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
saying in terms of um you wouldn't want
 
01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:02.119 align:start position:0%
to put some broad criteria in places
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
where it wouldn't make sense because the
 
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
population needs so I would need to look
 
01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
you would need to look at the um at how
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
the program is being rolled out but I I
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
name it as the state is making
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
investments in these in this direction
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
to deal with a housing crisis so let's
 
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that the interests of these
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
populations are at the table and being
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
Solutions go ahead um yeah I I think
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
that kind of like the walkability and
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
and and also being able to have you know
 
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
services that that are provided to you
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
look close to you um is is important you
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
know we talk we've talked many times
 
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
about the people that don't drive in
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
here and and stuff like that um be just
 
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
being able to kind of get out and into
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
the community um that can be a barrier
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
with kind of the zoning like all all the
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
business over here and your your
 
01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
residential stuff is over here
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
um but I wanted to kind of touch on what
 
01:34:13.629 --> 01:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
we talked about or what we were hearing
 
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit earlier um about how people
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
the the business was renting these um
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
these homes to provide services to the
 
01:34:31.109 --> 01:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
community um
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
and it also seems like you know there's
 
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
a capital kind of cost that was a
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
barrier for
 
01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
getting uh purchasing of these
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
facilities is there
 
01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.550 align:start position:0%
facilities is there
anything

01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
that um new hampsh housing that jumped
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
out to you in that conversation I guess
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
that that New Hampshire housing could
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
currently do um to help secure funding
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
or to to provide interest you
 
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
know free loans or whatever um or is um
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
that something
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
that is possible to be done through New
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing if if it
 
01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
if it needs a new program to to be able
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
to meet that need or or is there
 
01:35:32.109 --> 01:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
something that that can do that now okay
 
01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
I do want to note that you know Easter
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
Seals is probably one of the most
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
successful providers in our state for
 
01:35:42.669 --> 01:35:42.679 align:start position:0%
this population and um most sustainable
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
model so I I trust if they've decided to
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
have a rental model or ownership model
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
that they're making good fiscal
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
decisions given how they've grown and
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
served the most uh people in our state
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
and I also know that you know the
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
leadership there is very familiar with
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
the capital and sub rental subsidy tools
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
available through our state Housing
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
Finance Agency because they've done work
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
with that agency but also to clarify for
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
this committee We Are The Advocates
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
housing action New Hampshire and so
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
we're not the we I'm not employed by New
 
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority so I
 
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak to what their
 
01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
programs could do I do want to name that
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
the um special I'm going to get the
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
title wrong Commission on um opioid
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
settlements um has designated a a fund
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
specifically for Supportive Housing for
 
01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
um people with uh opioid and substance
 
01:36:42.669 --> 01:36:42.679 align:start position:0%
use disorders again and that they are
 
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
launching a separate initiative there
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
and I um I would ask New Hampshire
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
housing to name it I believe it's $6
 
01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159 align:start position:0%
million for three years and could renew
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
um as part of a the opioid settlement
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
that came to the state and uh so to
 
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
answer your question I think there are
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
tools that you could create but I would
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
caution against creating them within the
 
01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:11.719 align:start position:0%
trust fund because you don't want to
 
01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
start once you start doing that it's
 
01:37:18.270 --> 01:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
like hard to um return to flexibility
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
but I do think you could have special
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
initiatives for specific population
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
but I would defer to our colleagues that
 
01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh who um create those kind of financial
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:36.990 align:start position:0%
 
projects

01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
L could you explain a little more what
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
um are the
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
79e programs in
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities yes so 79e exists in
 
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
statute right it's and and the state
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
simply enabled it to expand it um in
 
01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
1400 it expanded 79e to be used for
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
commercial conversions but essentially
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
it would be up to the municipality to
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
offer that
 
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
um and I think in the community toolbox
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
bill that we passed in 2017 I believe
 
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
was the first time we directed we
 
01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
started to look at 79 as a tool uh that
 
01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
allowed for municipalities to do it just
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
to incentivize Workforce housing but
 
01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
then we expanded it to say if you want
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
you could also incentivize a
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
developer um through tax deferral on uh
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
well any more questions
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right thank you so
 
01:39:03.589 --> 01:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
coming all right we have one more person
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
on the agenda and that would be Lori
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
us and then um we we'll have to look
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
over the minutes and accept
 
01:39:24.669 --> 01:39:24.679 align:start position:0%
those does he
 
01:39:24.679 --> 01:39:41.589 align:start position:0%
those does he
thank

01:39:41.589 --> 01:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.109 --> 01:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
you my name is Lori McIntosh and I'm
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
with our place NH a few weeks ago I made
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
a statement in this room that I would
 
01:39:51.870 --> 01:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
like to retract I apologize to the
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee and in particular to senator
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
richardi for criticizing a new project
 
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
that would house adults with
 
01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:58.669 align:start position:0%
that would house adults with
developmental

01:39:58.669 --> 01:39:58.679 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities I did something that I'm
 
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
famous for and that's opening my mouth
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
before activating my
 
01:40:07.149 --> 01:40:07.159 align:start position:0%
brain um we need all kinds of housing
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
models and choices for people with
 
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
disabilities what might be right for one
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
person is not necessarily right for
 
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
someone else I cannot disparage a
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
well-run group home model in fact there
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
is a wonderful Group Home in Portsmouth
 
01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
that I'm well familiar with where the
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
residents are extremely happy and
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
thriving and I'm sure the Easter Seals
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
group homes are great too so to set the
 
01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
record straight I'm glad that Senator
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
richardi was able to help obtain funding
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
for that project and any effort to
 
01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
provide more housing for this population
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
should be applauded and not
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
criticized what I was trying to say was
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
that in our excitement to create more
 
01:40:44.910 --> 01:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
housing options we need to be careful to
 
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
make sure we learn from the lessons of
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
the past we need to make sure that all
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
housing opportunities provide adequate
 
01:40:53.709 --> 01:40:53.719 align:start position:0%
support encourage integration in the
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
Greater Community assist with jobs and
 
01:40:59.310 --> 01:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
recreational activities and promote
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
self-determination people need to be
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
able to make their own choices about
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
where they live how much help they need
 
01:41:07.229 --> 01:41:07.239 align:start position:0%
and how they spend their time thank you
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to try to set the record
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
straight okay thank you so much all
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%

01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
then we'll have to accept the
 
01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%

01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
sit there and review your notes and then
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%

01:42:52.119 --> 01:43:22.109 align:start position:0%

confusion about requirements are often
 
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
really challenging to navigate and are
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
adding barriers to development um on top
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
of what exists around funding and and
 
01:53:22.589 --> 01:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
other issues around own resources please

and certification changes
 
01:53:31.629 --> 01:53:31.639 align:start position:0%
um that could potentially surmount some
 
01:53:33.629 --> 01:53:33.639 align:start position:0%
of these logistical challenges while
 
01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
also still keeping guard rails in place
 
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
to protect the community for the long
 
01:53:41.709 --> 01:53:41.719 align:start position:0%
term please also consider the importance
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
of adus and especially adus that have
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%

01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
live with a live-in caregiver um adus
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
allow adults with disabilities to have
 
01:53:57.069 --> 01:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
their own space to live while still
 
01:54:00.069 --> 01:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
being able to access support when needed
 
01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
they can also help fill a gap in housing
 
01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
availability for people with
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities the proposed budget from
 
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
BDS um as we know it for right now
 
01:54:13.229 --> 01:54:13.239 align:start position:0%
contains an increase in funding to fund
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
room and board These funds are needed to
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
help cover the costs of housing for
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
individuals with developmental
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities were unable to maintain
 
01:54:24.069 --> 01:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
sufficient employment to cover costs
 
01:54:26.109 --> 01:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funds cannot be used for this
 
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
purpose which leaves a gap for
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
individuals with significant support
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
needs related to their
 
01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
disability we ask that you support this
 
01:54:36.990 --> 01:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
request for the coming SE session it is
 
01:54:38.910 --> 01:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
critically important that the committee
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
recognized that there's no one-size
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
fits-all solution for housing for
 
01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:45.639 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities everyone
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
has unique needs and circumstances that
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
impact what housing Arrangement is
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them individ uals must
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
retain the ability to live in the home
 
01:54:57.709 --> 01:54:57.719 align:start position:0%
setting that works best for their needs
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
staffed residential homes enhanced
 
01:55:02.189 --> 01:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
Family Care Homes supported Independent
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
Living independent housing within the
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
community and others and we have to make
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
sure to always remember that we are not
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
returning to a world where individuals
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities lived in
 
01:55:20.109 --> 01:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
institutions also any choice in housing
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
and any discussion um
 
01:55:25.229 --> 01:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
we need to have it shared in plain
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
language for people with disabilities to
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
be able to access so I just wanted to
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
leave those uh sort of closing remarks
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
um From csn's perspective um and again
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
we look forward to continuing to hear
 
01:55:40.589 --> 01:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
more about what others in the community
 
01:55:40.599 --> 01:55:42.149 align:start position:0%
more about what others in the community
are

01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%

01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
sharing all right thank you does anyone

01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
elaborate on the different options that
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
your the agencies provide so are you um
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
are you asking about the list of the
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
different options that I just listed or
 
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
what area agencies provide what area
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
agencies provide your the agencies yeah
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
so area agencies um are the the
 
01:56:56.350 --> 01:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
designation of Area Agency is a uh
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
specific sort of type of service um
 
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
within area agencies though they can
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
choose to provide certain other provider
 
01:57:10.589 --> 01:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
services so Direct Services um there are
 
01:57:14.109 --> 01:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
some not all area agencies that choose
 
01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
to provide Residential
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
Services um CPS Services which are we
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
sort of historically referred to his day
 
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
Services um for residential services um
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
an area agency can choose to offer um
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
enhanced family care which has been kind
 
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
of the adult foster care model um where
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
an individual would live with a
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
contracted home provider um so that's
 
01:57:45.870 --> 01:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
enhanced Family Care um there are some
 
01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh area agencies who operate a staffed
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
residence so it could be a 247 staffed
 
01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
model um sort of similar to what you
 
01:57:56.830 --> 01:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
heard Sue talking a little bit about
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
today um there are there's also a um
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
varying levels of community support for
 
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who live in the community so
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
there are some people who really just
 
01:58:11.229 --> 01:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
need some help getting groceries or
 
01:58:12.669 --> 01:58:12.679 align:start position:0%
getting out into the community getting
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
to work um and that you know that that's
 
01:58:18.149 --> 01:58:18.159 align:start position:0%
really dependent on the individual's
 
01:58:23.229 --> 01:58:23.239 align:start position:0%
needs um there's also um other support
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
models um where you know an individual
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
might live with a family um a family
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
caregiver um you know it really sort of
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
runs the gamut there are many many
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
different uh housing options for
 
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
individuals and some area agencies
 
01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
choose to do
 
01:58:46.350 --> 01:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
some um you know it really is a it's a
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:54.510 --> 01:58:54.520 align:start position:0%

01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
they could not be able to attend

today the first um testimony that I'm
 
01:59:52.709 --> 01:59:52.719 align:start position:0%
going to read is by someone by the name
 
01:59:56.669 --> 01:59:56.679 align:start position:0%
of em Emory Quinn of Manchester New
 
01:59:59.310 --> 01:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my name is Emory Quinn and I
 
02:00:01.629 --> 02:00:01.639 align:start position:0%
am one of your disabled constituents I
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
am currently living in Barnstead at a
 
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
family home due to the inaccessibility
 
02:00:08.589 --> 02:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
of my current apartment in Manchester
 
02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
which I am to trying to break the lease
 
02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
of I am living on the second floor of my
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
apartment building the elevator in the
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
building was broken down for over a week
 
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
which is the second time there has been
 
02:00:22.350 --> 02:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
problems with it the inspection for
 
02:00:24.510 --> 02:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
which has been expired for over 6 months
 
02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
at this point with the elevator down the
 
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
water has been shut off multiple times
 
02:00:31.709 --> 02:00:31.719 align:start position:0%
during construction with a note posted
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
to the doors instructing residents to
 
02:00:36.149 --> 02:00:36.159 align:start position:0%
use facilities that are a quarter mile
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
away from the building following a road
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
with crumbling sidewalks and no curb
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
Cuts while expressing my concern not
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
just for myself but for the other
 
02:00:48.669 --> 02:00:48.679 align:start position:0%
wheelchair users in this building and
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
those dependent on the elevator I was
 
02:00:53.790 --> 02:00:53.800 align:start position:0%
told to mind my own business
 
02:00:55.950 --> 02:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
since we have moved in there have been
 
02:00:58.589 --> 02:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
two long bouts of construction during
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
that time the accessible ramp has been
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
blocked off and the accessible parking
 
02:01:05.229 --> 02:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
places have been filled with equipment
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
thankfully the construction Crews have
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
been helpful in dealing with it the
 
02:01:11.950 --> 02:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
management have not been helpful even
 
02:01:14.189 --> 02:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
with multiple reminders we have been
 
02:01:17.550 --> 02:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
consistently met with indifference and
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
hostility we signed the lease knowing we
 
02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
had one small closet to place my
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
wheelchair and other Mobility AIDS in at
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
this time it is currently being replaced
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
with a washer and dryer leaving us with
 
02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
the task of finding storage elsewhere
 
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
most months we can hardly afford food
 
02:01:36.629 --> 02:01:36.639 align:start position:0%
and rent let alone the idea of renting a
 
02:01:36.639 --> 02:01:37.709 align:start position:0%
and rent let alone the idea of renting a
storage

02:01:37.709 --> 02:01:37.719 align:start position:0%
storage
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
facility this has added to the complete
 
02:01:42.750 --> 02:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
inaccessibility of my current apartment
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
as I am left with very little mobility
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
and means of getting around during the
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
current construction the floor has been
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
torn up in the hallways leaving it un
 
02:01:54.030 --> 02:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
even and very risky to wheel my chair
 
02:01:56.830 --> 02:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
over entrances are blocked and the
 
02:01:58.629 --> 02:01:58.639 align:start position:0%
accessible parking spaces are again
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
filled with pallets I am afraid of
 
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
rolling into the building because of the
 
02:02:05.069 --> 02:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
possible damage to my wheelchair which I
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
would be left paying $5,000 out of
 
02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:08.709 align:start position:0%
would be left paying $5,000 out of
pocket

02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
pocket
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
for during all of this I keep reflecting
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
on the privilege I have that many that
 
02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
find themselves in my situation do not a
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
place to stay knowledge of resources
 
02:02:21.629 --> 02:02:21.639 align:start position:0%
time to reach out and learn about what
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
can be done to help and connections to
 
02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:25.229 align:start position:0%
can be done to help and connections to
community

02:02:25.229 --> 02:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
organizations many people don't have
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
families to stay with or other options
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
to fall back on I am incredibly grateful
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
for the resources and support that I do
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
have but even still I find myself in
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
what feels like an impossible
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
situation I can only imagine what it
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
would be like without the help I do have
 
02:02:46.350 --> 02:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
how others in my situation feel when
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
they have no support or help at
 
02:02:51.310 --> 02:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
all I have spent over the last month
 
02:02:53.069 --> 02:02:53.079 align:start position:0%
reaching out out to several legal
 
02:02:55.229 --> 02:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
departments and organizations that are
 
02:02:57.750 --> 02:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
there for times like this specifically
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
for lowincome and disabled individuals
 
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
but because of the housing crisis
 
02:03:05.550 --> 02:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
everyone is at Max Capacity and unable
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
to provide Aid I reached out to the
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on disability and
 
02:03:11.629 --> 02:03:11.639 align:start position:0%
learned that they would not be able to
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
pursue my case without attaching my name
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
to it not being able to access even
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
basic help without the protection of an
 
02:03:23.550 --> 02:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
anonity sorry is a huge deterrent as
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
there is so much risk involved
 
02:03:28.229 --> 02:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
retaliation is illegal but we also know
 
02:03:31.390 --> 02:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
that it happens myself and many others
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
in this position barely have enough
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
money to afford rent let alone what it
 
02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
may cost to defend ourselves against
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
possible retaliation from landlords or
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
the ability to take our landlords to
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
court there's even more risk involved if
 
02:03:47.109 --> 02:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
you are an immigrant if you are a person
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
of color if you are queer or disabled
 
02:03:53.069 --> 02:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
intersecting identity increase the risk
 
02:03:56.350 --> 02:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
and fear of retaliation exponentially it
 
02:03:58.109 --> 02:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
is a risk that a lot of people cannot
 
02:03:59.390 --> 02:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
afford to
 
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
take I want to thank you for your time
 
02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
and dedication to looking into such an
 
02:04:06.589 --> 02:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
important issue that many gr Granite
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
Staters find themselves faced with as a
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
disabled person we're often invisible
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
and not given the space to speak out
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
about issues that affect us directly
 
02:04:18.510 --> 02:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
it's refresh refreshing to see that
 
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
these spaces are being created and that
 
02:04:22.030 --> 02:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
there are people out there are willing
 
02:04:24.069 --> 02:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
to listen and try to take action to
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.390 --> 02:04:29.400 align:start position:0%

what kind of housing I can access
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
literally stairs especially those
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%

brand new mostly Ada accessible
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%

02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
over half of my take-home pay I am
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
blessed that my parents were willing to
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
co-sign my lease but I work full-time
 
02:05:09.549 --> 02:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
for a state agency I'm 36 years old I
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%

the first accessible Housing Opportunity
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
I have found in my adult life how many
 
02:05:18.990 --> 02:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
of my disabled brothers and sisters do
 
02:05:21.069 --> 02:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
not have the support or means to afford
 
02:05:23.669 --> 02:05:23.679 align:start position:0%
an apartment made with access in mind
 
02:05:25.149 --> 02:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
that allow them to live fully
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
independently in the
 
02:05:29.950 --> 02:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
community I believe a few paths are in
 
02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
front of us in New Hampshire to create
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
more accessible housing fund

live in Nashua I am asking you to
 
02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
consider the following information in
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
your review of how the housing crisis in
 
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire impacts people with
 
02:06:16.990 --> 02:06:17.000 align:start position:0%

not live in an Institutional setting we
 
02:06:21.310 --> 02:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
should be able to interact with other
 
02:06:23.229 --> 02:06:23.239 align:start position:0%

um last
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
time there was a question of like how
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
the the interim report is going to be
 
02:07:37.629 --> 02:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
written and what's going to be on it and
 
02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:41.679 align:start position:0%
how how are we gonna write write it and
 
02:07:43.149 --> 02:07:43.159 align:start position:0%
what's going to be on it and stuff like
 
02:07:45.790 --> 02:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
that so um did you you said that you
 
02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
were going to get some information about
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
that right did you get some and can you
 
02:07:55.709 --> 02:07:55.719 align:start position:0%
share with me okay here um um here um
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
our researcher gave us a um template for
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
what our report could look like um she
 
02:08:09.549 --> 02:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
also um emailed us um some reports that
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
have been done by other folks so there's
 
02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:16.669 align:start position:0%
have been done by other folks so there's
um

02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:16.679 --> 02:08:19.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:08:19.709 --> 02:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:30.750 --> 02:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
here this
 
02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:40.719 --> 02:08:43.229 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:08:43.229 --> 02:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:43.239 --> 02:08:45.149 align:start position:0%
the
the

02:08:45.149 --> 02:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:48.270 --> 02:08:48.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay all right so and this has been
 
02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
emailed to us so if we want to um you
 
02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
know look at it um and then figure out
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
um about maybe doing a work session and
 
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh talking about what we think should be
 
02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
included in the report um what kind of
 
02:09:06.549 --> 02:09:06.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations did you say a work
 
02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
session yeah I okay so you're
 
02:09:10.549 --> 02:09:10.559 align:start position:0%
potentially you're considering another
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
meeting before before
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
November 1 yeah I I honestly well I've
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
been told that there aren't um there
 
02:09:22.549 --> 02:09:22.559 align:start position:0%
aren't there aren't report police who
 
02:09:24.750 --> 02:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
are going to come and arrest us if we
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't get it in by November
 
02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
1st I mean I I voted for the law I
 
02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
should probably follow it I also think
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
it may be possible that we would come up
 
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
with one simple piece of legislation fil
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
by the deadline in
 
02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:43.990 align:start position:0%
by the deadline in
November

02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
November
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
well I was not reelected so this will be
 
02:09:47.639 --> 02:09:48.549 align:start position:0%
well I was not reelected so this will be
my

02:09:48.549 --> 02:09:48.559 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:09:53.709 --> 02:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
last meeting of as of the committee
 
02:09:53.719 --> 02:09:55.270 align:start position:0%
last meeting of as of the committee
so

02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
um I won't be filing anything right but
 
02:10:03.229 --> 02:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
the uh so I just wanted to give kind of
 
02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
my thoughts or whatever as um and make
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
like find out what's going to be in the
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
report or have some contribution I guess
 
02:10:18.270 --> 02:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
to the the the um findings
 
02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.109 align:start position:0%
to the the the um findings
recommendations

02:10:20.109 --> 02:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
I I
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:33.790 --> 02:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
can I guess less is more but but it also
 
02:10:40.109 --> 02:10:40.119 align:start position:0%
seems like more is more so last time you
 
02:10:41.669 --> 02:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
were talking about you wanted to have
 
02:10:45.390 --> 02:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
like a lot of stuff in your report and
 
02:10:48.069 --> 02:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
this report is obviously kind
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
of it's really trying to condense it
 
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
down to like you know one page
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
or maybe maybe the p a page of our notes
 
02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
like maybe six pages or something like
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
that not not uh you know the yeah all of
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
the information yeah so I you know we
 
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
received a lot of information you know
 
02:11:13.629 --> 02:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
testimony Etc so um I think we can write
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
a report and then um have you know an
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
appendix or a denda that has all of the
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
materials that we you know when I when I
 
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
was thinking about it I thought you know
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
the report should include a list of
 
02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:30.559 align:start position:0%
everyone that we received testimony from
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay and then some um important things
 
02:11:36.669 --> 02:11:36.679 align:start position:0%
that we've discovered like the lack of
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
affordability the elective
 
02:11:43.549 --> 02:11:43.559 align:start position:0%
accessibility um and then some
 
02:11:46.589 --> 02:11:46.599 align:start position:0%
opportunities um and you know um
 
02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
barriers to creating new forms of
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
housing for people with dis disabilities
 
02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
and then you know as far as
 
02:11:58.549 --> 02:11:58.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations you know looking into
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
those things and um I think yes it's
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
possible that we could have
 
02:12:07.549 --> 02:12:07.559 align:start position:0%
some there's a section here for process
 
02:12:09.310 --> 02:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
and procedures right and it's part of
 
02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
our charge to to talk with certain
 
02:12:14.910 --> 02:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
people so we can kind of address that
 
02:12:17.950 --> 02:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
we've met some of those requirements in
 
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
the law um if and uh by listing out
 
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
those people that that came finding
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations I think that two it's
 
02:12:29.790 --> 02:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
kind of twofold if there is anything
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
that we know that there is you know
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that we think that is
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate um that could be one section
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
and then also kind
 
02:12:47.790 --> 02:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
of just thinking about going where we go
 
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
in the next year right and and how we
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
want to dig
 
02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
deeper um
 
02:13:00.109 --> 02:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
you I think you know for example my my
 
02:13:03.629 --> 02:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the the definition of of
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
facility and how it was brought up last
 
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
time that that uh by someone I think
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
that the uh the
 
02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
facility may
 
02:13:22.149 --> 02:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
be is is kind of uh
 
02:13:24.669 --> 02:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
based on the number of
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
rooms or the beds or um the number of
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
people staying in there
 
02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
um and in one
 
02:13:37.069 --> 02:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
structure versus in kind of like a
 
02:13:39.189 --> 02:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
separate apartment or something like
 
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
that so you know this like the the
 
02:13:45.069 --> 02:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
example that was given here today right
 
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
where they they rented something from
 
02:13:53.109 --> 02:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
someone if those if they rented if let's
 
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
say they rented a three-bedroom
 
02:13:56.430 --> 02:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
apartment and so they had three people
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
in that building right and then they
 
02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
happened that they worked well with that
 
02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
landlord they rented a different
 
02:14:05.629 --> 02:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
three-bedroom apartment happens to be in
 
02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
the same building that I think would qu
 
02:14:12.669 --> 02:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
make them qualify for um needing L
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
needing lure I don't know but I I think
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
that because it's under the same
 
02:14:22.510 --> 02:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
roof um even though it's two separate
 
02:14:26.030 --> 02:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
contracts or whatever um it may be
 
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
something that this committee may want
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
to dig in more about how are they
 
02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:34.310 align:start position:0%
to dig in more about how are they
specifically

02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
defining uh the the facility and the
 
02:14:40.709 --> 02:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
scope of the facility kind of a thing
 
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
and so that's one of the things uh that
 
02:14:47.790 --> 02:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
I think is it it's a little archaic or
 
02:14:49.549 --> 02:14:49.559 align:start position:0%
or kind of in the weeds but it's
 
02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
something that I think is having
 
02:14:54.109 --> 02:14:54.119 align:start position:0%
significant ramifications and if you
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
know uh if the company that was that was
 
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
here earlier had a a business or had had
 
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
someone that they were able to work with
 
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
that could achieve that why should that
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
why should we put be putting additional
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
barriers or whatever in the way I I
 
02:15:16.350 --> 02:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
think that that's something that could
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
have an impact on what you know if they
 
02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
if they opened up another facility in
 
02:15:25.270 --> 02:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
that in that um that place so it's just
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
something that that I think is like an
 
02:15:31.069 --> 02:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
example of where I think this committee
 
02:15:34.109 --> 02:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
could go deeper into the weed yeah I I
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
agree but I think we
 
02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
should probably have a work session or a
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting where we try to come up
 
02:15:46.750 --> 02:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
with um our what we want in the
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
preliminary report and then um
 
02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
you know plan to to go deeper into some
 
02:15:57.470 --> 02:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
issues maybe take action on anything we
 
02:16:00.189 --> 02:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
that something simple we could tackle
 
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
this year and then um plan it out do we
 
02:16:05.470 --> 02:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
have to vote to accept it or is it kind
 
02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
of just like you submit it to the clerk
 
02:16:09.470 --> 02:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
or something like that and that's it
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:15.910 align:start position:0%
 
say

02:16:15.910 --> 02:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
Okay okay so it sounds like a work
 
02:16:18.079 --> 02:16:19.549 align:start position:0%
Okay okay so it sounds like a work
session

02:16:19.549 --> 02:16:19.559 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:16:21.910 --> 02:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
then if we're if we're taking a vote
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
then we have to be here and it has to be
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:34.559 align:start position:0%
right I mean if we voting then there's
 
02:16:38.349 --> 02:16:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
meeting oh yes yes I mean we are meeting
 
02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
right now I'm
 
02:16:46.830 --> 02:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
talking yeah but if we weren't going to
 
02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
to write the yeah yes so looking so
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
so as so either we decide it now or if
 
02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
we want to work on it you know for a
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
little while then we would have to have
 
02:16:59.519 --> 02:17:00.549 align:start position:0%
little while then we would have to have
a

02:17:00.549 --> 02:17:00.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
meeting well I'm fine with that how how
 
02:17:06.669 --> 02:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
are you okay with that with which one um
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
one with coming back I'm fine with
 
02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
coming back
 
02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:12.429 align:start position:0%
coming back
um

02:17:12.429 --> 02:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:15.309 --> 02:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
uh before the
 
02:17:15.319 --> 02:17:18.070 align:start position:0%
uh before the
first

02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:17:21.469 --> 02:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
29 the the next Tuesday yeah
 
02:17:23.230 --> 02:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we could just have it as a
 
02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
work session and and and then at the end
 
02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
of the meeting we'll just plan to um
 
02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
like have our ideas hopefully uh ahead
 
02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:34.599 align:start position:0%
of time and then kind of discuss them
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
and and then we
 
02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:41.599 align:start position:0%
can like do a mockup of like what like
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
the bullet points or something like that
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
we don't have to have it like all typed
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
out or whatever like she said it long as
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
the gist is there and then can fill it
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
out you know I'll just put put you know
 
02:17:55.309 --> 02:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
together a a draft I do want to include
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
the you know who we heard from
 
02:17:59.030 --> 02:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely because that sounds good in
 
02:18:01.349 --> 02:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
the original legislation there was a
 
02:18:04.750 --> 02:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
list that representative Reed provided
 
02:18:08.910 --> 02:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
for us of who we supposed to talk to um
 
02:18:11.230 --> 02:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
and we did hear from most of them but
 
02:18:13.589 --> 02:18:13.599 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah so let's plan on on coming
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
back here next Tuesday and I'll I'll
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
just put up kind of
 
02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
a you know sort of a draft for us to
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
work off okay and based on the um the
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
template that we've been provided and
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
looking at some of these other reports
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
like you know like some of them are more
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
substantial than others she only had one
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
copy of this but she has emailed it to
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
us so I think what we're looking at is
 
02:18:42.549 --> 02:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
something more like this that will have
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
attachments to it and so forth okay okay
 
02:18:48.629 --> 02:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
all right that sounds good uh so are you
 
02:18:51.309 --> 02:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
thinking one o' 1:30 again yep 130
 
02:18:53.790 --> 02:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
sounds good can you make sure that
 
02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah I wasn't saying that we had
 
02:19:12.990 --> 02:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
to notice that we're gonna make a
 
02:19:14.589 --> 02:19:14.599 align:start position:0%
decision no that's not what I was trying
 
02:19:14.599 --> 02:19:15.589 align:start position:0%
decision no that's not what I was trying
to

02:19:15.589 --> 02:19:15.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:19:19.309 --> 02:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
say um but I
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we
 
02:19:23.150 --> 02:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
just let everyone know that we're not
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be soliciting
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
comment and stuff like that so so they
 
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to show up if they don't
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
really uh if they're unless they just
 
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
want to hear us talk to each
 
02:19:40.110 --> 02:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
other but but feel free
 
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
to um I think that that's that's all
 
02:19:47.950 --> 02:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
that I had so I could make a motion to
 
02:19:51.309 --> 02:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
adjourn do I have a second
 
02:19:54.349 --> 02:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
second okay um without objection the
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
meeting is adjourned all right so good
 
02:19:56.640 --> 02:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
meeting is adjourned all right so good
good
