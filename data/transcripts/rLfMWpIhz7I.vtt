fund<00:13:18.639><c> for</c><00:13:19.279><c> G's</c><00:13:20.279><c> um</c><00:13:20.600><c> how</c><00:13:20.880><c> quickly</c><00:13:21.600><c> that</c><00:13:21.800><c> fund</c><00:13:22.720><c> uh</c>

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
fund for G's um how quickly that fund uh
 

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.110 align:start position:0%
fund for G's um how quickly that fund uh
would<00:13:23.920><c> uh</c><00:13:24.040><c> decrease</c><00:13:24.720><c> I</c><00:13:25.079><c> I</c><00:13:25.199><c> remember</c><00:13:25.600><c> years</c><00:13:25.839><c> ago</c>

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
would uh decrease I I remember years ago
 

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.310 align:start position:0%
would uh decrease I I remember years ago
when<00:13:26.279><c> they</c><00:13:26.480><c> had</c><00:13:26.720><c> that</c><00:13:26.920><c> fund</c><00:13:27.720><c> that</c><00:13:27.839><c> was</c><00:13:28.040><c> always</c>

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
when they had that fund that was always
 

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.509 align:start position:0%
when they had that fund that was always
that<00:13:28.519><c> issue</c>

00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
that issue
 

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:33.230 align:start position:0%
that issue
um<00:13:29.959><c> you</c><00:13:30.079><c> know</c><00:13:30.240><c> we're</c><00:13:30.480><c> down</c><00:13:30.720><c> to</c><00:13:31.240><c> 1,500</c><00:13:32.120><c> or</c>

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
um you know we're down to 1,500 or
 

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.350 align:start position:0%
um you know we're down to 1,500 or
1,800<00:13:34.240><c> um</c><00:13:34.639><c> so</c><00:13:34.920><c> that'll</c><00:13:35.199><c> take</c><00:13:35.399><c> us</c><00:13:35.959><c> three</c><00:13:36.199><c> or</c>

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
1,800 um so that'll take us three or
 

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.350 align:start position:0%
1,800 um so that'll take us three or
four<00:13:36.680><c> more</c><00:13:37.680><c> and</c><00:13:38.040><c> we</c><00:13:38.199><c> have</c><00:13:38.440><c> another</c><00:13:38.880><c> six</c><00:13:39.120><c> months</c>

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
four more and we have another six months
 

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.949 align:start position:0%
four more and we have another six months
to<00:13:39.519><c> go</c><00:13:39.720><c> or</c><00:13:40.000><c> what</c><00:13:40.199><c> have</c><00:13:40.360><c> you</c><00:13:41.199><c> uh</c><00:13:41.320><c> so</c><00:13:41.600><c> that</c><00:13:41.839><c> that</c>

00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:41.959 align:start position:0%
to go or what have you uh so that that
 

00:13:41.959 --> 00:13:42.910 align:start position:0%
to go or what have you uh so that that
would<00:13:42.120><c> be</c>

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
would be
 

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:52.710 align:start position:0%
would be

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.629 align:start position:0%

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
feel that that would
 

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.430 align:start position:0%
feel that that would
reduce<00:14:03.360><c> have</c><00:14:03.560><c> the</c><00:14:03.720><c> potential</c><00:14:04.120><c> of</c><00:14:04.279><c> reducing</c>

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%

00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
know if if uh you know they sense this
 

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.749 align:start position:0%
know if if uh you know they sense this
this<00:14:21.120><c> would</c><00:14:21.519><c> happen</c><00:14:22.560><c> um</c><00:14:23.560><c> I</c><00:14:24.199><c> one</c><00:14:24.279><c> of</c><00:14:24.399><c> the</c><00:14:24.519><c> things</c>

00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:24.759 align:start position:0%
this would happen um I one of the things
 

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:27.269 align:start position:0%
this would happen um I one of the things
I<00:14:24.839><c> think</c><00:14:25.040><c> is</c><00:14:25.279><c> is</c><00:14:25.519><c> tough</c><00:14:26.120><c> for</c><00:14:26.639><c> the</c><00:14:26.759><c> judges</c><00:14:27.079><c> in</c>

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
I think is is tough for the judges in
 

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:28.949 align:start position:0%
I think is is tough for the judges in
answering<00:14:27.880><c> the</c><00:14:28.040><c> question</c><00:14:28.279><c> is</c><00:14:28.399><c> they</c><00:14:28.759><c> know</c><00:14:28.880><c> the</c>

00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
answering the question is they know the
 

00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:31.069 align:start position:0%
answering the question is they know the

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.470 align:start position:0%

certainly a smaller number of high

because they

can so it says that they formulate a

can so it says that they formulate a

00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
know I think it might vary Case by case
 

00:21:12.679 --> 00:21:15.710 align:start position:0%
know I think it might vary Case by case
because<00:21:13.120><c> some</c><00:21:13.279><c> of</c><00:21:13.960><c> the</c><00:21:14.960><c> investigations</c><00:21:15.559><c> may</c>

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
because some of the investigations may
 

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.470 align:start position:0%
because some of the investigations may

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
be very easy and simple and some may
 

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.870 align:start position:0%
be very easy and simple and some may

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
take longer for one reason or another so
 

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.630 align:start position:0%
take longer for one reason or another so
it<00:21:20.520><c> it</c><00:21:20.720><c> may</c><00:21:21.039><c> vary</c><00:21:21.840><c> between</c><00:21:22.200><c> case</c><00:21:22.400><c> whether</c><00:21:22.559><c> it's</c>

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
it it may vary between case whether it's

00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
perception that the judges have it is it

perception that the judges have it is it
is<00:24:41.200><c> not</c><00:24:41.399><c> necessarily</c><00:24:42.039><c> measured</c><00:24:42.600><c> but</c>

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily measured but
 

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.990 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily measured but
typically<00:24:43.720><c> because</c><00:24:43.919><c> they're</c><00:24:44.120><c> giving</c><00:24:44.679><c> sort</c><00:24:44.840><c> of</c>

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
typically because they're giving sort of
 

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.870 align:start position:0%
typically because they're giving sort of
their<00:24:45.200><c> factual</c><00:24:45.600><c> findings</c><00:24:46.159><c> there's</c><00:24:46.399><c> not</c><00:24:46.679><c> as</c>

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
their factual findings there's not as
 

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.470 align:start position:0%
their factual findings there's not as
much<00:24:47.720><c> room</c><00:24:48.080><c> if</c><00:24:48.200><c> the</c><00:24:48.320><c> findings</c><00:24:48.760><c> aren't</c><00:24:49.080><c> robust</c>

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
much room if the findings aren't robust
 

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.350 align:start position:0%
much room if the findings aren't robust
then<00:24:49.600><c> they're</c><00:24:49.760><c> not</c><00:24:49.960><c> persuasive</c><00:24:50.520><c> to</c><00:24:50.679><c> the</c><00:24:50.840><c> judge</c>

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
then they're not persuasive to the judge
 

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.269 align:start position:0%
then they're not persuasive to the judge
so<00:24:51.559><c> even</c><00:24:51.799><c> if</c><00:24:51.960><c> you</c><00:24:52.679><c> were</c><00:24:52.919><c> trying</c><00:24:53.399><c> to</c><00:24:53.760><c> to</c><00:24:53.919><c> wait</c><00:24:54.120><c> it</c>

00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
so even if you were trying to to wait it
 

00:24:54.279 --> 00:24:56.430 align:start position:0%
so even if you were trying to to wait it
it<00:24:54.399><c> would</c><00:24:54.559><c> it</c><00:24:54.640><c> would</c><00:24:54.760><c> be</c><00:24:55.120><c> difficult</c><00:24:55.240><c> to</c><00:24:55.399><c> do</c><00:24:56.320><c> um</c>

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
it would it would be difficult to do um
 

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.870 align:start position:0%
it would it would be difficult to do um
so<00:24:56.600><c> I</c><00:24:56.679><c> know</c><00:24:56.799><c> that</c><00:24:56.960><c> that's</c><00:24:57.240><c> that's</c><00:24:57.399><c> not</c><00:24:57.799><c> the</c>

00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
so I know that that's that's not the
 

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.230 align:start position:0%
so I know that that's that's not the
judge's<00:24:58.240><c> perception</c><00:24:58.679><c> right</c><00:24:58.799><c> now</c><00:24:58.960><c> that</c><00:24:59.120><c> they</c>

00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
judge's perception right now that they
 

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.430 align:start position:0%
judge's perception right now that they
see<00:24:59.880><c> a</c><00:25:00.039><c> bias</c><00:25:00.799><c> from</c><00:25:01.000><c> from</c><00:25:01.159><c> guardians</c><00:25:01.520><c> edl</c><00:25:01.799><c> item</c>

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
see a bias from from guardians edl item
 

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.190 align:start position:0%
see a bias from from guardians edl item
but<00:25:02.760><c> I</c><00:25:02.840><c> will</c><00:25:03.159><c> certainly</c><00:25:04.159><c> see</c><00:25:04.440><c> if</c><00:25:04.559><c> there's</c><00:25:04.760><c> data</c>

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
but I will certainly see if there's data
 

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.710 align:start position:0%
but I will certainly see if there's data
I<00:25:05.360><c> I</c><00:25:05.440><c> don't</c><00:25:05.720><c> think</c><00:25:05.919><c> so</c><00:25:06.240><c> because</c><00:25:06.399><c> it's</c><00:25:06.559><c> it's</c>

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
I I don't think so because it's it's
 

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.310 align:start position:0%
I I don't think so because it's it's
just<00:25:06.880><c> not</c><00:25:07.159><c> sort</c><00:25:07.360><c> of</c><00:25:07.640><c> tracked</c><00:25:08.039><c> in</c><00:25:08.240><c> that</c><00:25:08.480><c> way</c><00:25:09.120><c> um</c>

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
just not sort of tracked in that way um
 

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.029 align:start position:0%
just not sort of tracked in that way um
it's<00:25:09.520><c> it's</c><00:25:09.679><c> in</c><00:25:09.799><c> our</c><00:25:10.000><c> different</c><00:25:10.360><c> Case</c><00:25:10.600><c> Files</c>

00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's in our different Case Files
 

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:12.230 align:start position:0%
it's it's in our different Case Files
but<00:25:11.240><c> not</c><00:25:11.360><c> necessarily</c><00:25:11.720><c> in</c><00:25:11.760><c> a</c><00:25:11.840><c> way</c><00:25:11.960><c> we</c><00:25:12.039><c> could</c>

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily in a way we could
 

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.269 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily in a way we could
pull<00:25:12.480><c> out</c><00:25:12.760><c> to</c><00:25:12.880><c> run</c><00:25:13.039><c> a</c><00:25:13.520><c> report</c><00:25:14.520><c> um</c><00:25:14.919><c> but</c><00:25:15.039><c> I</c><00:25:15.159><c> know</c>

00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
pull out to run a report um but I know
 

00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:18.710 align:start position:0%
pull out to run a report um but I know
that<00:25:15.440><c> that</c><00:25:15.520><c> is</c><00:25:15.679><c> not</c><00:25:15.919><c> the</c><00:25:16.039><c> judge's</c><00:25:16.799><c> perception</c>

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
that that is not the judge's perception
 

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:26.669 align:start position:0%
that that is not the judge's perception
okay<00:25:19.720><c> any</c><00:25:19.919><c> other</c><00:25:20.159><c> questions</c>

00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:32.029 align:start position:0%
 
or

00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:36.190 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:25:32.279><c> I</c><00:25:32.399><c> think</c><00:25:32.679><c> that's</c><00:25:33.080><c> that's</c><00:25:33.240><c> all</c><00:25:33.799><c> I</c><00:25:34.799><c> um</c><00:25:35.240><c> I</c><00:25:36.080><c> got</c>

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
so I think that's that's all I um I got
 

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.830 align:start position:0%
so I think that's that's all I um I got

deal it's probably 200 250 350 300 right
 

00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:43.750 align:start position:0%
deal it's probably 200 250 350 300 right
so<00:27:40.799><c> uh</c><00:27:40.919><c> so</c><00:27:41.120><c> the</c><00:27:41.320><c> 130</c><00:27:42.039><c> I'm</c><00:27:42.159><c> wondering</c><00:27:42.519><c> if</c><00:27:42.799><c> that's</c>

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
so uh so the 130 I'm wondering if that's
 

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.029 align:start position:0%
so uh so the 130 I'm wondering if that's
is<00:27:43.919><c> that</c><00:27:44.200><c> enough</c><00:27:44.440><c> to</c><00:27:44.600><c> get</c><00:27:44.799><c> enough</c>

00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
is that enough to get enough
 

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:49.110 align:start position:0%
is that enough to get enough
interest

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.470 align:start position:0%
 
um<00:27:50.120><c> that</c><00:27:50.320><c> that</c><00:27:50.399><c> is</c><00:27:50.519><c> a</c><00:27:50.640><c> good</c><00:27:50.840><c> question</c><00:27:51.240><c> because</c>

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
um that that is a good question because
 

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.750 align:start position:0%
um that that is a good question because
we<00:27:51.600><c> are</c><00:27:51.760><c> in</c><00:27:51.919><c> a</c><00:27:52.279><c> a</c><00:27:52.399><c> nationwide</c><00:27:52.960><c> labor</c><00:27:53.279><c> shortage</c>

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
we are in a a nationwide labor shortage
 

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.149 align:start position:0%
we are in a a nationwide labor shortage
so<00:27:53.919><c> it</c><00:27:54.000><c> is</c><00:27:54.240><c> it</c><00:27:54.360><c> is</c><00:27:54.559><c> harder</c><00:27:55.120><c> to</c><00:27:55.279><c> get</c><00:27:55.600><c> people</c><00:27:55.880><c> for</c>

00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
so it is it is harder to get people for
 

00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:57.950 align:start position:0%
so it is it is harder to get people for
things<00:27:56.480><c> that</c><00:27:56.640><c> we</c><00:27:56.919><c> could</c><00:27:57.080><c> have</c><00:27:57.559><c> gotten</c><00:27:57.799><c> them</c>

00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
things that we could have gotten them
 

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
things that we could have gotten them
for<00:27:58.320><c> in</c><00:27:58.440><c> the</c><00:27:58.640><c> past</c><00:27:58.960><c> they're</c><00:27:59.279><c> in</c><00:27:59.440><c> demand</c><00:27:59.840><c> in</c>

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
for in the past they're in demand in
 

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.509 align:start position:0%
for in the past they're in demand in
other<00:28:00.480><c> places</c><00:28:01.480><c> uh</c><00:28:01.559><c> so</c><00:28:01.760><c> that</c><00:28:01.919><c> it</c><00:28:02.279><c> I</c><00:28:02.360><c> think</c>

00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:02.519 align:start position:0%
other places uh so that it I think
 

00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:03.870 align:start position:0%
other places uh so that it I think
that's<00:28:02.679><c> our</c><00:28:02.960><c> our</c><00:28:03.120><c> average</c><00:28:03.399><c> cost</c><00:28:03.640><c> now</c><00:28:03.799><c> but</c>

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
that's our our average cost now but
 

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.310 align:start position:0%
that's our our average cost now but
that's<00:28:04.000><c> a</c><00:28:04.080><c> good</c><00:28:04.240><c> question</c><00:28:04.480><c> if</c><00:28:04.600><c> we</c><00:28:04.760><c> expanded</c><00:28:05.159><c> it</c>

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
that's a good question if we expanded it
 

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.990 align:start position:0%
that's a good question if we expanded it
would<00:28:05.519><c> we</c><00:28:05.679><c> be</c><00:28:05.799><c> able</c><00:28:06.000><c> to</c><00:28:06.120><c> attract</c><00:28:06.640><c> enough</c>

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
would we be able to attract enough
 

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.110 align:start position:0%
would we be able to attract enough
people<00:28:07.399><c> at</c><00:28:07.600><c> that</c><00:28:07.840><c> price</c><00:28:08.320><c> and</c><00:28:09.200><c> um</c><00:28:09.559><c> we</c><00:28:09.679><c> may</c><00:28:09.880><c> not</c>

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
people at that price and um we may not
 

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.870 align:start position:0%
people at that price and um we may not
know<00:28:10.279><c> the</c><00:28:10.440><c> answer</c><00:28:10.679><c> but</c><00:28:10.799><c> I</c><00:28:10.880><c> can</c><00:28:11.000><c> certainly</c><00:28:11.559><c> see</c>

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
know the answer but I can certainly see
 

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.110 align:start position:0%

they're trained well and um and I think
 

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.710 align:start position:0%
they're trained well and um and I think
also<00:30:00.399><c> too</c><00:30:00.799><c> that</c><00:30:00.960><c> they</c><00:30:01.120><c> need</c><00:30:01.320><c> to</c><00:30:01.559><c> make</c><00:30:02.039><c> sure</c><00:30:03.039><c> um</c>

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
also too that they need to make sure um
 

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.389 align:start position:0%
