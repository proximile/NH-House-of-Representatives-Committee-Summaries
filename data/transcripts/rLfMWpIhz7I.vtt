00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 align:start position:0%
areed um I understand there's no uh
 
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh but are they specic
 
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
are the judges specific as to what
 
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
they're looking for uh this G to deliver
 
00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
report and and the other one was uh with
 
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
respect to mental health or substance
 
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
use yes they are they are charged to
 
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
issue so so and with respect to
 
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
um mental health and
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
substitutes are there clinicians used
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
for determining I know the I know the
 
00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 align:start position:0%
court that I
 
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
visited um there there one of the
 
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
parties was supposed to get evaluated on
 
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
their own uh that didn't happen uh the
 
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
judge gave another three months for this
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
person to get
 
00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 align:start position:0%
evaluated uh which I found problematic
 
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh because he had three months and he
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
didn't do it right uh there was another
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
three months given and
 
00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 align:start position:0%
um the party was getting visitations and
 
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
the other party was concerned uh with
 
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
his alcohol use um and it was
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know that he was given another three
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
months to see the child uh you know I
 
00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 align:start position:0%
would have thought that it was okay the
 
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 align:start position:0%
visitation over until you come back in
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
three months and we have a uh uh uh
 
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.790 align:start position:0%
three months and we have a uh uh uh
substit

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
substit
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation uh so so it it appears that
 
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.670 align:start position:0%
evaluation uh so so it it appears that
there's

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
not that it's up to the party that in
 
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
this case the judge left it up to the
 
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
party for that party to get uh
 
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.909 align:start position:0%
party for that party to get uh
themselves

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
evaluated uh which I'm not sure if any
 
00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
of them would use a
 
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
um a clinician and and say you know set
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
up an appointment with this person uh
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
and when you come back we're expecting a
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know a report um
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
evaluation um so yeah if you
 
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:07.550 align:start position:0%
evaluation um so yeah if you
get

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
good morning representative just for
 
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
record purposes Erin krian general
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
counsel for the courts uh thank you for
 
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
these questions um one of the things I
 
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
have to say is that I am the general
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
counsel so I am not as expert in each of
 
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
the subject matters as some of our
 
00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
judges like J Ashley name again I'm
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
sorry Aaron krian Aaron okay um but I I
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
will be happy to get you these questions
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
and others that you have and and have
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
the judges write them for you but as a
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
general matter people do find their own
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
clinicians there could be different
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
considerations cost local locality for
 
00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
them you know if the court were very
 
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
restrictive and who they could use that
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
it could be an expensive person or
 
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
someone who's far um so there there is a
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
little flexibility there but I think
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
that the courts are very receptive to
 
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
your inquiry into whether there is a way
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
to provide more mental health expertise
 
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
to the courts unfortunately a lot of
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
these things are at people's own
 
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
cost um and that's just the money that
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
we have is is not available for those
 
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
services so it's it's certainly
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
something worth looking
 
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.950 align:start position:0%
something worth looking
into

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
okay so so when a judge orders a a um
 
00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.550 align:start position:0%
okay so so when a judge orders a a um
alcohol

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
evaluation um that's on the person to
 
00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
pay for that evaluation typically yes
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
okay um and it's I mean it the person
 
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
that it's uttered on doesn't have the
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
option of saying I don't have any money
 
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how I'm going to get
 
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
that done they can they can submit
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
Financial affidavits but they're not a
 
00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
lot of funds that are dedicated you
 
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 align:start position:0%
think of something like for example the
 
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
J fund has the guardian and liem fund
 
00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
has not been funded um I'm not sure when
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
it was last funded but it hasn't been
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
funded for a number of years so there
 
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
would have to be a specific fund that
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
the court could draw from to to cover a
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
particular cost that the person could
 
00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
then submit a financial affidavit and
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
show that they're eligible based on
 
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
criteria that the legislature sets but
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
there is no there is no funding for any
 
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
of that I'll I'll check if there is any
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
circumstance whether in a particular
 
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
case it would be covered out of an
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
existing fund okay but I know that there
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
are not there's not a
 
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
that okay any other questions anybody
 
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.230 align:start position:0%
that okay any other questions anybody
may

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
have I just noticed um after going oh
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm Judy um Linda um and um
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
basically um I noticed that when I did
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
go to court um with listening in that it
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
seemed like a lot of people had problems
 
00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:47.959 align:start position:0%
finding a spot to go to uh where they
 
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
could go to get the mental health or or
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
their evaluations um and that is where I
 
00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
think it it definitely if they're going
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
to be um that they need need to go to
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
these there has to be some places that
 
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
are going to accept these um because
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
that's the only way to move forward in
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
order to um get them the proper
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
evaluations that they need because
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise otherwise I mean how are they
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
going to get the assistance that they're
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.389 align:start position:0%
 
need

00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
go do you know if I'm sorry
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
representative Greg do you know if the
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
G's they're always they attorneys from
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing it's attorneys I don't
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
know if they're always attorneys I would
 
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
have to check on that I think that's
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
frequently the case Okay um
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative Kataba has actually put
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
in a bill that I'm interested in that
 
00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking at um this
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
year but it it really talks about rather
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
than only having an attorney doing it
 
00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
especially whenever we have these
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
nuances of that go beyond the legal
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
realm when they're more in the mental
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
health realm but actually where is so um
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
somebody that would hold a bachelor's
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
Master's or doctorate degree in
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
Psychology law Social Work counseling or
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
be a family practitioner so that there's
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
a wider range of what we're we're
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
um I mean I guess is that something that
 
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
we will just discuss this bill when it
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
comes up I assume this would come up
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
before us so um I
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
certainly that's the direction I've
 
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
always been headed in since we first
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
heard about the gal here that I'm I'm
 
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.829 align:start position:0%
heard about the gal here that I'm I'm
concerned

00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
about basically so somebody that might
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
need more legal help is not somebody
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
that can afford a gal anyway because
 
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
they might be more prosay so um I guess
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
um do you even do you know how often the
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
gals are used currently I think they're
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
frequently requested but they're they're
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
frequently not able to be afforded by
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
the party so there there's many cases in
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
which they're discussed as an option but
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's just not possible for them to
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
afford to have one appointed yeah we
 
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
heard two cases representative Lon and I
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually went to the courts together and
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
we heard two cases where they requested
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
it but were unable to afford it so so do
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
do we have data and how many are
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
financing um they're not provided I it'
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
be helpful to know what the Court's
 
00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
needs are uh that are being met uh with
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
respect to G's uh whether the judge
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
would want the G to help determine
 
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
something and because of finances it's
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's not available so I don't think we
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
have a system whereby a person is
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily putting it in a case
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
tracking system where I could go and
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
pull a report but what I could see is
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
the last time that the fund was funded
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
how much the draw was when the the
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
guardian lium fund was funded that might
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
give you a pretty good idea of what the
 
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.509 align:start position:0%
give you a pretty good idea of what the
interest

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:06.519 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
is go Ahad can we file anything with
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
like that would have a budget type thing
 
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
or does that have to wait till next year
 
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
because I I'm really interested in
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
trying to get this funded for indigen
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
families again yeah it would uh it would
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
be difficult in the off year to get
 
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
funding as we went through the budget so
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
so be something we'd have to look at
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
next session yeah okay yeah
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
and uh I think I already asked this but
 
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I got an answer the the
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
um are there times where the judges will
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
specify you need to go uh you need a
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
evaluation um and you need to go to
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
Manchester greater Manchester mental
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
health uh for that evaluation or
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
or or will the judge just say uh you
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
know I'd like to have you get a mental
 
00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:56.629 align:start position:0%
know I'd like to have you get a mental
health

00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
evaluation and you're on your own
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
I think it's it is I will check that for
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
you I think it is typically not
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
specified exactly where to go okay but I
 
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
will check that for you and make sure
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh and I think that would be
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
helpful uh last time that we did have a
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
fund for G's um how quickly that fund uh
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
would uh decrease I I remember years ago
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
when they had that fund that was always
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
um you know we're down to 1,500 or
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
1,800 um so that'll take us three or
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
four more and we have another six months
 
00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:41.959 align:start position:0%
to go or what have you uh so that that
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:52.710 align:start position:0%
would be
interesting

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
um yeah and also also with respect to
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
the parenting coordinator do the judges
 
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
feel that that would
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
reduce have the potential of reducing
 
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
conflict have the potential of uh
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
parties coming to
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
conclusions um I I I'd be anxious to
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
know if if uh you know they sense this
 
00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:24.759 align:start position:0%
this would happen um I one of the things
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
I think is is tough for the judges in
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
answering the question is they know the
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire system very well and
 
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're not necessarily as
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
familiar with what may have been
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
successful in another state um there are
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
certainly a smaller number of high
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
conflict cases that take up a lot of the
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
Court's time because they have to uh for
 
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
everyone to have their opportunity to be
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
heard I think it's hard for the
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
practitioners the judges to know this
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
will be the thing that changes that
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
because they don't have direct
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
experience whereas someone working in
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
another state might say yes this has
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
been very successful or it has not been
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
as successful as hoped when we
 
00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
implemented this system um it's
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
certainly something that they're
 
00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:08.759 align:start position:0%
interested in and I think it's good they
 
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
they they definitely are interested in
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
solving some of these issues and giving
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
more services to people in high conflict
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
cases but it's tough to project whether
 
00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
this would be the thing that would help
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
reduce that conflict versus neutral case
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
evaluations versus the mediator with a
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
different background um I think that's
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
not something that they have necessarily
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
studied um but certainly want to give
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
more services in high conflict cases so
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that it um it would
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
Aid it would relieve the judges of
 
00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
some issues having somebody to help them
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
uh because if there's no parent parental
 
00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:54.759 align:start position:0%
coordinator the judge is doing that uh
 
00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
or or trying to affect that to to bring
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
less you know conflict um so the fact
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
that they have somebody that could help
 
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
them with that um on its face looks you
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
know whether or not we know it's going
 
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
to accomplish the goals that we're
 
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
looking for it accomplishes yet to be
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
seen um but that you know that the uh
 
00:16:20.749 --> 00:16:20.759 align:start position:0%
cases that I heard um it was
 
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
overwhelming uh I felt for a judge to
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
have to deal with a lot of a lot of
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
proads that he's dealing with and and
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
you know that they're not
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
um you know they're not in any rush it
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
appeared to me in my opinion was that
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
they weren't in any rush to fixing
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
anything they were comfortable in the
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
conflict um and the judge was looking in
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
my case the judge was looking to uh to
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
reduce that um so having
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
another another person helping in that
 
00:16:59.790 --> 00:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh on its face would seem long
 
00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:01.959 align:start position:0%
it is certainly worth exploring and and
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the judges would say
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
no to more resources for for cases that
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
um do take up a lot of court time and
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
okay okay so just in looking at the case
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
text for what the idea or the updated
 
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
case text which is section um G
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
5302 it looks like New Hampshire code um
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know it talks about the what the
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
guardian at Liam is I probably initially
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
assigned to do but one of the things is
 
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
to come to an independent conclusion
 
00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799 align:start position:0%
about what's in the best interest of the
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
recipient but we now have legislation
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
where they cannot make a recommendation
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm almost looking at if the
 
00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
current the current ramifications we
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
have or restrictions we have I'm just
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
wondering how effective this actually is
 
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
because they
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
can so it says that they formulate a
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation which they can't do now
 
00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:11.799 align:start position:0%
or such other report as directed by the
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
appointing court so really they're an
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
investigator for the court that's all
 
00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
they are and it's just they're just
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
looking into things kind of Pi kind of
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
thing for the court is that what I'm
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
understanding they certainly have an
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
investigative role um which is they're
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
they're seen as an extension of the
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
Court the time that the court not able
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
to necessarily give to look into all of
 
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
these matters independently so I I think
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.190 align:start position:0%
 
characterization

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
okay I mean I would say with the current
 
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions on a gal funding that are
 
00:18:45.159 --> 00:18:47.830 align:start position:0%
restrictions on a gal funding that are
saying

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
that I guess I just don't see it being
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
as successful right now I see more
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
Hang-Ups with it because of their
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
limitations and um their backgrounds and
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
stuff I don't know I
 
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
actually even if
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
somebody say they can't afford it but we
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
assign it to them besides just being an
 
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:10.039 align:start position:0%
investigative tool I'm not sure the the
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
benefit uh the way that it currently
 
00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:14.430 align:start position:0%
benefit uh the way that it currently
sits

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
sits
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
right I mean I don't know about you
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
but what would be interested also is uh
 
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039 align:start position:0%
of the G's
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
appointed uh how many of them are are
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
one party's paying or they splitting
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
that that would be interested to know
 
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
too um to see how many are uh onesided I
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
you know to know how many are dropped
 
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
because nobody has the finances uh how
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
many one side pays and how many both
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
sides split I may have to obtain an
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
anecdotal estimate on that for you but
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll see what I yeah that would be
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
and what I'm understanding is it's it's
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
specific you know when there's a g
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
appointed it's to look for a specific
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
issue that the judge needs to know
 
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559 align:start position:0%
typically it's an assignment from the
 
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
judge to the guardian at lium to look
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
into a delineated issue or issues and
 
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
report back to the court okay so so it's
 
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
not a wide as wide as uh
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know you're charged
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
with reporting to me the best interest
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
of the child I have wide open seen one
 
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
that broad it is it is typically more
 
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
targeted but I will check that there's
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
not a scenario in which you would have
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
for example like a catch all at the end
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
or You' say I want you to look into all
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
these items and let me know if you
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
encounter anything else that relates to
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
best interest okay and is there a time
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
is there a time frame that they're given
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
um so let's say that the next hearing is
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
in two months um the is the G expected
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
to report within that time frame for the
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
next hearing do you
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
know I think it might vary Case by case
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
because some of the investigations may
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
be very easy and simple and some may
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
take longer for one reason or another so
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
it it may vary between case whether it's
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
a shorter assignment or a larger one
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay and at the hearing each party can
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
object or question uh the report of the
 
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
G absolutely are they are they told that
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh do you know did the judges tell them
 
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
that or or do they have to automatically
 
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
know so if the G gives a report that's
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
not very good to one party uh could that
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
party uh interject or not interject but
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
say I disagree with XYZ and for whatever
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
reason why uh and are they told that if
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
they don't agree with the gao's report
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
can we um you know feel you know
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
you're you're um you're okay with
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
letting us know why and the reason why
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh you don't believe it's correct I
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
think they get it in writing they get a
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
sort of just a so they get a copy a copy
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
of the report and and sort of general
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
information but let me see if I can look
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
at the writing and see exactly what's
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
written in it yeah with with the High um
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
Pro uh uses I think the more that
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
they're told um you know the the more
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's less apt to uh be confusing or or
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
leave after hearing saying I didn't
 
00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:48.039 align:start position:0%
agree with what the G said and you know
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I had an opportunity to
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
dispute it um I just wanted to be clear
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
that they they know um they could
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
and it I mean this data is probably not
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
kept uh
 
00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:09.870 align:start position:0%
kept uh
but

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
uh the determination of the
 
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.310 align:start position:0%
uh the determination of the
G

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
G
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
um what percentage would lean towards
 
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
the person
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
paying uh I know in children and family
 
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
law for years we hear about you know the
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
G lean to
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
towards uh my ex because they were
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
paying um you know so I'm wondering if
 
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
if there's some way to know uh you know
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
was fair to both parties or it leaned
 
00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
towards one party and that party
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
happened to be the
 
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.350 align:start position:0%
happened to be the
payer

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
um because my understanding is there's a
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
set limit a set amount of price however
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
it could be extended
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
so if I'm a
 
00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
G and I'm looking for the
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
income um I know I got
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
$600 uh however I could get another $600
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
if uh because the person that's paying
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
me can afford it um if I leave something
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
in my report that the judge could extend
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
me for another $600 or whatever whatever
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
the costs are you know um I I I don't
 
00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:30.039 align:start position:0%
know how often the extensions are I
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
guess would be you know how often are
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
there extensions uh for another report
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
G I know that that is that is not a
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
perception that the judges have it is it
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily measured but
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
typically because they're giving sort of
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
their factual findings there's not as
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
much room if the findings aren't robust
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
then they're not persuasive to the judge
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
so even if you were trying to to wait it
 
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
it would it would be difficult to do um
 
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
so I know that that's that's not the
 
00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
judge's perception right now that they
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
see a bias from from guardians edl item
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
but I will certainly see if there's data
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
I I don't think so because it's it's
 
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
just not sort of tracked in that way um
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's in our different Case Files
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily in a way we could
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
pull out to run a report um but I know
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
that that is not the judge's perception
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:32.029 align:start position:0%
 
or

00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
so I think that's that's all I um I got
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of a lot of homework there that's
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
all right I'm gonna go uh thank you for
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
giving them to me because uh there's a
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
few different people I want to check
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
with to make sure I get everything so it
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
is helpful for me to have all your
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
questions so I can check with all the
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
different offices in the Court Circuit
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
administrators different judges and make
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
sure I get you a full picture so I
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate you giving me the questions
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
to take back I'm starting to I'm
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
starting to lean towards we were better
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
off when we had a when we had the
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
funding that made it fair for for
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
everybody uh and it helped the judge uh
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know and you know the cases that I
 
00:26:15.549 --> 00:26:15.559 align:start position:0%
heard uh with prays I well there was
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
four cases eight litigants and uh one
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
attorney for all you know in one of the
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
cases and
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm like what did you know the judge
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
has no court help uh like when I was
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
going through divorces back in the 80s
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
um you know uh
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
so I I see the strain on the judge
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
um you know so so it was especially when
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
you get a
 
00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:48.389 align:start position:0%
you get a
conflict

00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
um it's more difficult to peel young to
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
get to the bottom of the facts uh so
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
yeah that that those answers would be
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
very helpful and then yeah you know do
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
do we really got to think about putting
 
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
putting a line item uh for um G's back
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
in and I believe it was Judge Ashley
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
that said that the average was 120 to
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
130 an
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
hour I believe I remember that that was
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
okay okay and if they were
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys I'm thinking that
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
at the lower end
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
of I mean if I hire an attorney on a
 
00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:39.799 align:start position:0%
deal it's probably 200 250 350 300 right
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
so uh so the 130 I'm wondering if that's
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
is that enough to get enough
 
00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:49.110 align:start position:0%
is that enough to get enough
interest

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
um that that is a good question because
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
we are in a a nationwide labor shortage
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
so it is it is harder to get people for
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
things that we could have gotten them
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
for in the past they're in demand in
 
00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:02.519 align:start position:0%
other places uh so that it I think
 
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
that's our our average cost now but
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
that's a good question if we expanded it
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
would we be able to attract enough
 
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
people at that price and um we may not
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
know the answer but I can certainly see
 
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
if we have any information one way or
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
the other that we do know people that we
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
think would be interested or many of
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
those people have moved on they're not
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
available anymore I'll see if we know
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
that are there any G's that volunteer
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
their services or or is it all uh under
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
payment there there's no pro bono G's
 
00:28:32.909 --> 00:28:32.919 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain if there there is um I
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
know someone in the audience is
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
correctly mentioning that that Casa does
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
make themselves available on a volunteer
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
basis use and neglect cases only yeah
 
00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:42.919 align:start position:0%
for many things there may be um
 
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519 align:start position:0%
attorneys that do it as proon I'm not
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
certain of that but typically pro bono
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
for an attorney would be um you know
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
maybe a week or two a year so it it may
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
not be we just may not have a bar that's
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
large enough and interested in this
 
00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
particular right subject um and also you
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
do typically want folks that are well
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
trained that understand the area very
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
well whereas if someone is only coming
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
and doing it for a week or two a year um
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
that might not be someone that becomes a
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
go-to for the judges to appoint because
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
they're just not doing it every day with
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
lots of training and lots of knowledge
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
in the area and I'm wondering if G's
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
are your your new attorneys uh those
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
that just passed the bar or if there's a
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
good uh array of of experience versus
 
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
someone who's uh someone who just
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
started that's a good question I'll look
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
into that I think many judges do appoint
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
someone that they've seen before and
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
have confidence in but there there are
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
always new people entering so that's a
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
good question what our balance is
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
okay uh any other questions
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
I I would just like to say I think they
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
definitely need to make sure that
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're trained well and um and I think
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
also too that they need to make sure um
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
because the big the biggest thing is um
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
as we know the work shortage is a big
 
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.519 align:start position:0%
problem out there and um I know within
 
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
the court system I heard them speaking
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
to uh I went to the conquered court and
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
they said you know it's hard to even get
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
people in to work and so I think we need
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure um that if we're doing this
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
is a very important um for the cases
 
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
that we need to make sure that somehow
 
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
these um people need to be um I guess um
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
paid appropriately because it is um a
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
very if especially if the um the judges
 
00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
are going to want this and as well as
 
00:30:51.389 --> 00:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
you know I think they need to make sure
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
that they compensate them well because
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
um just like everything um I said
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere another um I'm noticing
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
throughout we know it's a work shortage
 
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
throughout I'm talking to so many people
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the um the court system not
 
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
only court system but at the jail system
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
the police police departments everybody
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
is looking for um because uh to looking
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
for employees people are leaving left
 
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
and right and we need to somehow find
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
some kind of solution for this because
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
um I know myself as a nurse um we have a
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
lot of people um even within the um
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
Health Care System that's um also but we
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
need somehow to find um an answer to
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
some of this and um but like I said this
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
is so important especially for the court
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
system to move forward and everything
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I I also agree that I
 
00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:00.039 align:start position:0%
that this is um incredibly important I
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
think the more we get into even Society
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
the complication of cases and what we're
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
looking at and um the psychology I would
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
like to see and it doesn't look like
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
there's any restriction on who can be a
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
a g it just happens to be I think more
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
lawyers or stuff but encouraging people
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
from other um pertinent um uh you know
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
of pertinent parts of the workforce that
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
might help with this too but I I think
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing is I I think the ones
 
00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:29.799 align:start position:0%
that need this the most are probably the
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
ones that can't afford it so I do think
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
that there that's something we
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
definitely need to look at and we also
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
heard from the judge that that would be
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
like her one big like wish list that we
 
00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
you know that they would have is to be
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
able to provide this to people um so I
 
00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
do think that we have a lot of work and
