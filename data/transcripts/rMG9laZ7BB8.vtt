28

30
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
He just locked in.

32
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000

33
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Yep, present in my house alone.

34
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Thank you.

35
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000

36
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000

37
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm in my office, but my wife's in the house walking about.

38
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Thank you.

39
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Representative Representative O'Pair?

40
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Present.

41
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.500
I'm in my office alone.

42
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.500
Representative Patero?

43
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.500
Representative Patero?

44
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500
Representative Patero?

45
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.500
Representative Sykes?

46
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.000
I'm here in the kitchen alone at my home.

47
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Thank you.

48
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Representative Cleaver?

49
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.500
Present and I am alone.

50
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.500
Representative Fenton.

51
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.500
I am present.

52
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.000
I am at my house and I'm happy to announce I am home.

53
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
My wife is in the room with our newborn son.

54
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Congratulations.

55
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Thank you.

56
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Representative Pickering.

57
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Here, home alone.

58
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Representative Rich.

59
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Thank you.

60
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
That's Representative Newman.

61
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.500
Thank you for that information.

62
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.500
Representative Newman.

63
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:27.000
I'm here and my wife, Representative Newman, may be, she's in the house and may enter the room occasionally.

64
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Thank you.

65
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Representative Talersky.

66
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I'm here.

67
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.500
I'm in my home with my husband and two sons who are also working today.

68
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.500
Thank you.

69
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.500
Representative Fox.

70
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.500
Thank you.

71
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.500
Representative Fox.

72
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.000
I am here at home.

73
00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.500
My husband is in the house and he's in and out of the room, but not observing the session.

74
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.500
Thank you.

75
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.500
And Representative Stevens.

76
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.000
Here, home, no one in the room.

77
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Thank you.

78
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And Representative Deayu.

79
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I am here in my office alone, but there are others in the house.

80
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Thank you.

81
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.500
And Tom is out for the moment.

82
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.500
Yep.

83
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.500
Right?

84
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.500
Okay, so we have...

85
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.000
Do you need to vote?

86
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.500
Do you need to come in here?

87
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.000
No, I couldn't get enough of that.

88
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Okay, who's going to introduce this?

89
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.500
Representative Marsh, is he on?

90
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.500
Okay.

91
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.000
Okay, I will introduce House Bill 78.

92
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.500
And speaker, Representative Marsh, are you around?

93
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.000
Okay, Representative Crawford will introduce the bill.

94
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Thank you, Mr.

95
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Chair.

96
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:12.500
I'm introducing House Bill 78 relative to certificates of title and driver's licenses for members of the United States Foreign Service.

97
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.000
And would you like to speak on the bill?

98
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I believe that Mr.

99
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.500
Anderson should be here to speak to the bill.

100
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.000
Okay, member of the public, Eric Anderson?

101
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Yeah, he's here.

102
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
One second, please.

103
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Okay.

104
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Can everybody hear me all right?

105
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.500
I'm about three inches from this mic.

106
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.500
I can hear you very well.

107
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.500
Thank you.

108
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.000
Look good in that chair, Representative Gagney.

109
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Thank you.

110
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
On my birthday yet.

111
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Oh, happy birthday.

112
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Double sevens.

113
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Double vote.

114
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Good morning.

115
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.500
Can everyone hear me okay?

116
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.500
Is that it?

117
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.500
All right.

118
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:19.500
Well, thank you so much to the Transportation Committee for today and thank you to Deputy and Representatives Marsh, Crawford, and Nelson for co-sponsoring this bill.

119
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.000
My name is Eric Anderson.

120
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:35.500
I also believe my colleague David Mulkey is also online and has some brief prepared remarks also to share with you should you be amenable to that.

121
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:42.000
My testimony reflects my own views today and not those of the U.S.

122
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
government.

123
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
In 2008, the U.S.

124
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.500
Department of State hired me and I deployed on orders from Madison to Washington, D.C.

125
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.500
for brief training and then onward to an overseas assignment.

126
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:28.000
I have served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Romania and as a diplomat in Suriname, Russia, and Thailand, and I will deploy to Afghanistan this summer when I will be separated from my wife, beloved hound mix rescue dog, and two young children, including like Representative Donovan, a baby girl that we had born just eight days ago.

127
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I am fiercely proud of our country, but perhaps even more so of our Granite State, having been born and conquered, raised in Amherst, graduated from public high school in Moultonboro, and even having a certain aversion to sales taxation.

128
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.500
My siblings and their families live in Moultonboro and my mom in Madison.

129
00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:10.500
I visit as much as I can and had we not just had our baby girl, I would almost certainly be participating in the Great Meredith Rotary Ice Fishing Derby this weekend.

130
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:18.000
I truly look forward to the day when I can eventually return home for good.

131
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.500
I'm here today to request your support for House Bill 78.

132
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:35.500
The bill's common sense tweaks will resolve residency and driver's license renewal challenges uniquely associated with service to country by members of the U.S.

133
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:40.500
Foreign Service from the state of New Hampshire, like myself.

134
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:51.500
One, the bill will allow New Hampshire foreign service professionals to maintain and renew their New Hampshire driver's licenses while deployed overseas.

135
00:09:51.500 --> 00:10:12.500
As the president of the American Foreign Service Association, former Ambassador Eric Rubin, wrote in a letter expressing support for this House Bill 78 to this committee, this is actually one of the biggest challenges cited by the organization's 16,000 plus members.

136
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:27.000
The license renewal process can have certain residency requirements that are difficult, if not impossible, to maintain simply because of our long-term active duty deployments outside of New Hampshire.

137
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:43.500
Two, this bill would allow New Hampshire residents to convert out-of-state driver's licenses to New Hampshire driver's licenses when they deploy from a domestic assignment outside of New Hampshire to an overseas location.

138
00:10:43.500 --> 00:11:05.000
This is critically important because New Hampshire foreign service professionals who are legitimately from New Hampshire and deploy overseas, are also likely to deploy from overseas locations to duty stations throughout the United States, most of which are unfortunately outside of New Hampshire.

139
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:23.500
During those domestic deployments, and unlike our military colleagues, we are frequently compelled to convert our New Hampshire driver's licenses to the licenses of the states to which we are assigned and temporarily reside on active duty.

140
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:29.000
But after such domestic deployments conclude, we typically redeploy overseas again.

141
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And here's the specific problem this would fix.

142
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:45.500
New Hampshire foreign service professionals in this situation will be able to convert that out-of-state driver's license back home to a New Hampshire driver's license.

143
00:11:45.500 --> 00:12:04.500
Bluntly, non-New Hampshire states should not be able to keep us New Hampshire foreign service professionals on their books indefinitely just because we happen to be in their state on a two or three-year deployment on active duty.

144
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:11.500
In 2013, for example, the State Department assigned me to Washington DC for Moscow.

145
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:23.000
At that time, I had to convert my New Hampshire driver's license to a DC driver's license in order to register a car.

146
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:41.500
But upon subsequent redeployment from DC back overseas, I struggled to convert my DC driver's license back home to a New Hampshire driver's license because I did not have a New Hampshire lease, mortgage, or utility bills.

147
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:52.500
New Hampshire military colleagues in this scenario would have simply retained their New Hampshire driver's license throughout all domestic and overseas assignments.

148
00:12:52.500 --> 00:13:13.500
This is required for the Service Members Civil Relief Act, a federal law that thankfully shields our military colleagues from these administrative challenges and grants numerous protections to our military colleagues who are frequently uprooting their lives in service to our nation.

149
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:19.000
Unfortunately, this law, however, does not extend to the Foreign Service.

150
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.500
Like the Uniformed Service, though, the Foreign Service also deploys frequently in service to nation.

151
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:39.500
And in some deployments, we face physical dangers, as the tragic loss of life in Libya, Kenya, South Sudan, Vietnam, and 61 other countries remind us.

152
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:51.500
In fact, about one-third of the active duty Foreign Service has served in a dangerous unaccompanied assignment, according to the American Foreign Service Association.

153
00:13:51.500 --> 00:14:06.500
The third fix this bill would enable is it would allow new New Hampshire spouses to acquire New Hampshire driver's licenses when marrying a New Hampshire resident on federal deployment.

154
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:13.500
My colleague David Mulkey will describe this challenge in greater detail in his testimony.

155
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:33.000
In short, House Bill 78 will enable foreign service professionals hired from New Hampshire, diplomats, international development professionals, and intelligence experts to preserve their legitimate connections to their home state of New Hampshire that they otherwise struggle to maintain.

156
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:44.500
It's an honor to serve the United States and the people of New Hampshire, and I hope you will support House Bill 78.

157
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.000
Thank you so much for your consideration.

158
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Thank you for your testimony, Mr.

159
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Anderson.

160
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.500
Any questions for the witness?

161
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.000
You'll have to help me.

162
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Yes, definitely.

163
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Go ahead.

164
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Thank you, Mr.

165
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.500
Chairman, and thank you, Mr.

166
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.000
Anderson, for answering my question.

167
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.500
It really is just, do you have a written testimony that you can send to the clerk?

168
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.000
I do have written testimony.

169
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.500
To be honest, we had a clearance process with the U.S.

170
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:31.500
Department of State regarding our personal testimony using personal time and resources.

171
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.500
When it's published, that requires an additional review.

172
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:47.500
So let me, if it's okay, let me just double check that review process, make sure I'm complying with the government's rules and regulations.

173
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:57.500
And once I get their clearance, I can go ahead and send that to the committee if that works okay.

174
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.500
Thank you very much.

175
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.500
Thank you.

176
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.500
Go ahead.

177
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.500
Thank you, Mr.

178
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.500
Chair.

179
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.500
And thank you so much, Mr.

180
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.500
Anderson, for your testimony this morning.

181
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.500
My question is, can you hear me, first of all?

182
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.500
Yes, I can.

183
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.500
Okay, good enough.

184
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.500
I just want to make sure our microphones are working.

185
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:34.500
So I'm interested to know, is there such a thing as universal driver's licenses?

186
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:42.500
Because I recall there used to be, and I don't know if that would apply here.

187
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:49.000
I am not aware of a universal federal driver's license of any kind.

188
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Perhaps what you might be thinking of is an international driver's license.

189
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So yeah.

190
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Yeah.

191
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.500
So there are, I'm not an expert on those that's maintained.

192
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:11.000
I'm not exactly sure how that works, but there are international driver's licenses.

193
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:22.500
I did have one in my first deployment to Suriname for one year because I anticipated difficulty getting a local Surinamese driver's license.

194
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:28.000
And if I recall correctly, it's valid for just one year.

195
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.500
It's a relatively short duration.

196
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.500
Okay.

197
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.500
Thank you very much.

198
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.500
Representative Sykes, I believe.

199
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.500
Yeah.

200
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.500
Thank you, Mr.

201
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.500
Chairman.

202
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.000
I actually changed my mind.

203
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.500
I've withdrawn my raised hand.

204
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.500
Thank you.

205
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.500
Okay.

206
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.500
Thank you.

207
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.500
Anyone else?

208
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.500
Okay.

209
00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.500
Seeing none.

210
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.500
Thank you.

211
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.500
Excuse me, Mr.

212
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.500
Chairman.

213
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.000
My hand has been up.

214
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
I apologize for interrupting.

215
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.500
I can hardly see that little yellow hand because this thing ain't working.

216
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.500
Okay.

217
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.500
Go ahead, Representative.

218
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.500
Thank you.

219
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.500
Thank you very much.

220
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.500
Thank you, Mr.

221
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.500
Anderson, for laying out your need.

222
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:39.500
I have family who served in the Foreign Service and we're all over the place, so I understand the challenges.

223
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:49.000
I am just curious if I'm looking at the verbiage here, a New Hampshire resident deployed on federal orders.

224
00:18:49.000 --> 00:19:03.000
you mentioned in passing the foreign service the peace corps would this apply to contractors is there a need for any more definition on who this applies to?

225
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:13.500
The vision in federal orders is that it would apply to any American citizen deployed on behalf of our nation overseas.

226
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:26.500
There are contractors who can deploy overseas, but I do not believe this would apply to them because our travel orders are cut by the U.S.

227
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.500
government.

228
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.500
So when I deployed to Afghanistan, the U.S.

229
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:37.000
Department of State will cut travel orders for me.

230
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:45.000
For contractors, their companies are responsible for their travel, even though they're working for the U.S.

231
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
government.

232
00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I'm not an expert in sort of employment of contractors, but my understanding is the way the language is written is that it would apply to American citizens working on behalf of the U.S.

233
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
government deploying overseas, basically in a civilian capacity.

234
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
It would apply to any civilians.

235
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:19.000
So, you know, in Bangkok, my last assignment, I worked very closely with our CDC colleagues.

236
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:26.500
And so it would apply to them, for example, they're, you know, deployed overseas there.

237
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:36.000
Any American outside of the military that doesn't have that service members civil relief protection, this would extend to.

238
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Basically, this is a fix because the federal protection of the federal, the service members civil relief act doesn't apply to civilians deploying overseas.

239
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:57.000
So this is kind of almost a stopgap to help resolve some of the challenges that we face.

240
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Did I answer your question sufficiently?

241
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
I think so.

242
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Thank you.

243
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Anyone else wish to ask a question of this witness?

244
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Thank you, Mr.

245
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Anderson, for your testimony.

246
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Thank you so much.

247
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:28.500
And just to note, my first name is Eric, but my son frequently uses this computer, and I just noticed his name is displayed here, so apologies.

248
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.500
Okay, thank you, sir.

249
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.000
Forgive me for mispronouncing your name, Mr.

250
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
David Moki.

251
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Are you there, sir?

252
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
I know.

253
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Hello.

254
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Can everybody hear me?

255
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
This is David.

256
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Yes, sir.

257
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Could you pronounce your last name for me?

258
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Sure.

259
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.500
My name is David Mulkey.

260
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.500
You got it just about right.

261
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.500
Thank you so much.

262
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.500
You're sideways.

263
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.500
Well, there we go.

264
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.500
I am halfway across the world.

265
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.500
Yes, you are.

266
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.500
Thank you, Mr.

267
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.500
Chair.

268
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:26.000
I want to echo the thanks given to Representatives Marsh, Crawford and Nelson and Deputy Speaker Smith for their support of this bill.

269
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Like my colleague Eric, I believe this proposed legislation will make a meaningful difference in the lives of Foreign Service members and their spouses, such as me and my wife.

270
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.500
My name is David Mulkey.

271
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:48.000
I am a Foreign Service officer with the U.S.

272
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.500
Department of State, and I was hired out of Woodstock, New Hampshire 15 years ago.

273
00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:07.500
Since then, the Department of State has assigned me to China, to Greece, to Iraq, to Vietnam, and now where I am in Thailand.

274
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:13.500
I met my wife at church when I was in Washington, D.C.

275
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:19.500
during a temporary assignment about 11 years ago, and life has happened.

276
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:28.000
I'm blessed with two young kids now, two adopted street dogs, one from Hanoi, one from Bangkok.

277
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.500
Nearly every time we go back to the United States, we return to New Hampshire.

278
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.500
My domicile is in New Hampshire.

279
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.000
I vote in New Hampshire.

280
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:50.000
I'm also deeply proud of my family legacy, both in New Hampshire, but also serving our nation overseas.

281
00:23:50.000 --> 00:24:01.000
My grandparents settled in Guilford in the 1950s, and they set up the Mulkey family Christmas tree farm, which still operates today.

282
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:09.500
My father spent three decades in the Foreign Service, including two tours in Vietnam during the war.

283
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:23.500
I have uncles who served 12 and 30 years in the Navy, an aunt who spent years in the Peace Corps and is an educator in Sub-Saharan Africa.

284
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:40.500
We are all New Hampshire residents, and I really hope my two children can follow in our footsteps too and represent both New Hampshire and the United States to the rest of the world.

285
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:47.500
Now, I have had a New Hampshire's driver's license for my entire adult life.

286
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:56.000
I learned to drive the New Hampshire way, not the way of some of our neighboring states.

287
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Renewing my license hasn't always been easy from overseas, though.

288
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:25.000
I remember one year arriving home from Athens late on Christmas Eve, then going up to Woodstock to celebrate Christmas Day with my family, and then rushing on the 26th the next day to the DMV to get a renewal, and then flying back out not long after.

289
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:38.000
I have, by the way, been very grateful for the customer service at the DMVs in Concord and especially in the Tamworth offices over the decades.

290
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:49.500
But I know many of my Foreign Service colleagues from New Hampshire have trouble renewing their New Hampshire licenses from out of state.

291
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:59.500
This is a challenge, especially as my colleague Eric mentioned, when we're assigned to do temporary tours in Washington, D.C.

292
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.500
or domestically.

293
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:15.500
Many Foreign Service officers have to get a driver's license temporarily from not just D.C., but maybe Virginia or Maryland to be able to have a car there.

294
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:23.000
But we really have no intention of settling in those places in the long term.

295
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:33.000
As Eric mentioned, our military colleagues have special rights to maintain their home state licenses, even when assigned elsewhere domestically.

296
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
It makes a lot of sense.

297
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Our military colleagues are uprooted often.

298
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.500
They're assigned by the DOD all over the world and all over the United States.

299
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:57.500
It's a common sense provision that allows military members to maintain those important home ties that a driver's license can symbolically represent.

300
00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:10.500
We Foreign Service members also uproot our lives often, typically every one, two, or three years, but federal law doesn't yet provide us a similar benefit.

301
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:19.000
That's why this proposed legislation is so important to members of the Foreign Service from New Hampshire.

302
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:36.000
In addition, this proposed legislation would make an important fix to allow spouses to acquire a New Hampshire driver's license when marrying a New Hampshire Foreign Service resident on federal deployment at a state.

303
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:45.500
For example, since I married my wife, we've been assigned to Hanoi, to Bangkok, and a temporary Washington, D.C.

304
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.500
tour.

305
00:27:47.500 --> 00:28:01.000
As much as we would have liked to spend some of these years living in New Hampshire, the Foreign Service had other ideas and sent us elsewhere.

306
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:21.000
So it's been challenging for my wife to meet current New Hampshire residency requirements to get a New Hampshire driver's license, despite her and my whole family's intention to keep our residency ties to New Hampshire well into the future.

307
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Currently, for example, my wife has a Virginia driver's license that will expire in a couple of months.

308
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.500
We don't want to renew a Virginia driver's license.

309
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:47.500
We don't have property there or any real ties there, but she's also not eligible to apply for New Hampshire driver's license from here in Bangkok.

310
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:59.000
This proposed legislation would make a practical difference in my wife's ability, my family's ability to strengthen and maintain these New Hampshire ties.

311
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:20.500
So to sum up, I believe that House Bill 78 would allow foreign service professionals from New Hampshire, diplomats, development experts, diplomatic security law enforcement officers to preserve and renew our connections to this great state and to our fellow New Hampshire residents.

312
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:36.000
And as our families grow, we'll be able to help our loved ones forge connections to New Hampshire as well, even if we spend much of our time on overseas mission.

313
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
So thank you once again for your consideration.

314
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Thank you, Mr.

315
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Mulkey.

316
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Will you take questions?

317
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.500
Sure, I'd be happy to.

318
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.500
Representative Aaron?

319
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.500
Thank you, Mr.

320
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.500
Chair.

321
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.500
Thank you, Mr.

322
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.500
Moke, for your testimony this morning.

323
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:07.000
In your story, in your testimony regarding your wife, where is her residency established now?

324
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.500
She is a registered New Hampshire voter.

325
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:18.500
And so she is a New Hampshire resident, or I think the technical term is domicile.

326
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.500
I think that's the tax and legal term.

327
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:28.000
So she is a New Hampshire domicile, a New Hampshire resident.

328
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
So, a follow-up?

329
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Yes.

330
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Thank you.

331
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:42.500
So as a result of that residency, she's been unable to obtain a New Hampshire driver's license?

332
00:30:42.500 --> 00:31:03.000
That's correct, because my understanding of the current procedures is that you have to show things like a utility bill or multiple pay stubs going to a New Hampshire address, documentation of that nature to get a New Hampshire's driver's license.

333
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:12.000
And unfortunately, since we're living in Bangkok, Thailand, we aren't able to fulfill those specific requirements from overseas.

334
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
I'll work.

335
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
One more follow-up.

336
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Thank you.

337
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
So I guess I'm confused then.

338
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:31.500
How was she able to get ability to vote in New Hampshire if she has no other way to show residency?

339
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:41.000
I am not an expert on how voter registration laws work in New Hampshire versus the driver's license laws.

340
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:50.000
But what we did in this last election is we followed the voter registration form to the T.

341
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
I was already registered to vote.

342
00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.500
And for my wife, she registered to vote for the first time in New Hampshire.

343
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:08.000
And based on the form, I believe we fulfilled all the criteria for my wife.

344
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Thank you.

345
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Appreciate it.

346
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Any other questions for the witness?

347
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.500
Seeing none, I have one question for you, sir.

348
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.000
What time is it there in Bangkok?

349
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
It's pretty late.

350
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:44.500
It's almost 9 9 30 p.m thank you brings back memories for me thank you any other questions uh any other uh people who have not signed up who wish to speak yes you have one in the queue.

351
00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.500
Hold on one second.

352
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.500
It's Elizabeth.

353
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.000
Can't pronounce her last name.

354
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Sorry.

355
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
It's the director.

356
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Oh, is this a DMV director?

357
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Yes, yes, yes.

358
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Okay, put her on.

359
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
She's on.

360
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Morning, Mr.

361
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.500
Chairman, can you hear me?

362
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.500
Yes, I can.

363
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:17.000
Good morning again, and happy birthday, and good morning, members of the committee.

364
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.500
Thank you for allowing me some time to speak.

365
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:39.000
I did sign up in opposition to the bill, and I'm only opposing the bill in the way it is written, and I'm happy to work with the sponsors on improving the language of it.

366
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.500
I oppose for several reasons.

367
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:47.500
And one of them is just some technical defects of the bill.

368
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:55.500
If I could bring your attention to paragraph two, which is a paragraph that both Mr.

369
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.500
Anderson and Mr.

370
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:11.000
Milkey talked about, where the intent would be to allow spouses to opt into a New Hampshire license while residing at a place outside of New Hampshire.

371
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:29.000
I am not sure how logistically we could make that happen because we really need an individual who has not been licensed in New Hampshire to be present to have their photograph taken at the DMV.

372
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:47.500
So if the intent of that is to apply for a New Hampshire license remotely or through the mail, we simply wouldn't be able to issue a license without a photograph and the individual present for that.

373
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:51.000
So that's section two of the bill.

374
00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Under section three of the bill, the current language allows federal employees assigned to a location outside of the United States or the spouses of those employees to maintain New Hampshire residency.

375
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:20.500
The new language that is added speaks to the conversion of an out-of-state license back to a New Hampshire license during such deployment, and I believe Mr.

376
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.500
Anderson also spoke about the logistics of that.

377
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:29.500
A couple of questions that we would have on that.

378
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:52.000
I think what the new language contemplates is someone deploys overseas, returns to a domestic post that's outside of the state of New Hampshire, then redeploys outside of the country, and is looking to then convert an out-of-state license back to a New Hampshire license.

379
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.500
So again, we would be looking for an application for a new license.

380
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:07.500
The question would be what type of documentation we would require to prove the deployment back and forth.

381
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:13.000
And my biggest concern with that would be the time frame.

382
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Again, how long would we allow for a conversion of a license to occur?

383
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:27.000
As long as we have a photo on file, that photo could be dated.

384
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.500
So perhaps contemplating a time frame during which we could make that conversion.

385
00:36:33.500 --> 00:37:13.500
And really, it would be an application for a new license, because that point when you convert your new hampshire license to an out-of-state license you are required to turn in your new hampshire license and you're issued a different state license so with this process of conversion we would be looking to also retain the out-of-state license and issue a new new hampshire license i'll pause right there and see if the committee members have any questions for me.

386
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.500
Thank you, Director.

387
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.000
Any questions for Director Malicki?

388
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Well, I have a lot in my head.

389
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
I can pause for a minute.

390
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
No, that's okay.

391
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Okay.

392
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Thank you.

393
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Go ahead, Representative.

394
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Thank you.

395
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
I can pause for a minute.

396
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
No, that's okay.

397
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Go ahead, Representative.

398
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Mr.

399
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.500
Chair, thank you, Director Bilecki.

400
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.500
This is Representative Crawford.

401
00:37:48.500 --> 00:38:10.500
I know we had conversations on this bill, and when it was written, I wasn't totally pleased with what was here, and I hope that we could work together to find some type of amendment that would work for you and work for Mr.

402
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.500
Anderson and his colleagues.

403
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:22.500
The problem that they're having is when they come back to the United States, they have to register their vehicles.

404
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:30.500
So they have to give up their New Hampshire license and get like a Washington, D.C.

405
00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.500
license in order to do that.

406
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:41.000
And they're in the country for a short period of time until they're deployed again.

407
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.500
With the military, they don't have to do that.

408
00:38:45.500 --> 00:39:02.000
Can you think of something just off the top of your head right now that could help them with that, or maybe we should just work together on trying to find a solution?

409
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Thank you for the question, Representative Crawford, and I apologize for not being able to get back to you and really raise all of the concern.

410
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:23.500
I know the bill has changed a little bit from the time that we've spoken about it.

411
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:27.500
I'm happy to collaborate with you and Mr.

412
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:32.000
Anderson on the language that would work for us.

413
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:47.500
Again, I'm not sure how we can find a way to fit the need for the spouses where they've never held a New Hampshire license to be able to issue one.

414
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:55.500
So section two of the bill, I really am not sure how we can accomplish that.

415
00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:12.000
With section three and the conversion of that, again, I think we could introduce language that allows those that are deployed outside of the United States to not have to reprove their residency.

416
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:36.500
Although I do want to say that in order to prove New Hampshire residency, sure, their property tax bills and other things, but we also would accept a notarized letter from a New Hampshire property owner that states that the individual maintains the residency at their address as well.

417
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:51.000
So there are other ways to prove New Hampshire residency outside of providing tax bills or vehicle titles or other things of proof of property ownership in New Hampshire.

418
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:59.500
So I think section three, we could look to come up with some compromised language as well.

419
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:17.000
My concern is the timeframe for which we would leave that conversion option open or application for New Hampshire license open because again, it's just the age of that photograph that we have on file.

420
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000
And at which point do we have an opportunity to update that?

421
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Representative Fenton, do you have your hand up?

422
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
No, I don't.

423
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Okay, Representative Aaron?

424
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Yes, thank you, Mr.

425
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Chair.

426
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.500
And thank you for your testimony, Ms.

427
00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.500
Belicki.

428
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:52.500
I'm interested to know what kind of know whether we do have a capability of having any kind of acceptance of international driver's license.

429
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.500
Is there such a thing still?

430
00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:59.000
Thank you for your question, Representative Aaron.

431
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:19.000
we really don't New Hampshire DMV doesn't get involved in the international driver's license it's really more from an enforcement perspective so if you have Erin, we really don't, New Hampshire DMV doesn't get involved in the international driver's license.

432
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.500
It's really more from an enforcement perspective.

433
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:45.000
So if you have an individual who's driving on New Hampshire roadways with an international driver's license, they really would just have potential interactions with law enforcement where those licenses would be acceptable for the duration of their stay in New Hampshire or the country.

434
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.500
Okay, thank you very much.

435
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.500
Sure.

436
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.500
Representative Tulerski.

437
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.500
Thank you, Mr.

438
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.500
Chairman.

439
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.500
Thank you, Director Bielecki.

440
00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:03.500
Can you advise us on what the process is for the military?

441
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:22.000
If you have a New Hampshire resident with a New Hampshire license deployed in the military and they marry and the spouse wants to acquire a New Hampshire license, is there a process in place for that?

442
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Yes, thank you for the question, Representative Talurski.

443
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
As Mr.

444
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Anderson has testified, the military members themselves don't have to give up their New Hampshire license, and even if they're deployed, they can renew their New Hampshire license either online or through the mail.

445
00:43:45.000 --> 00:44:03.500
Spouses of those military members would have to obtain their initial New Hampshire license through an in-person appointment as well, Because again, in order to issue a license, we need to take a photo of that individual.

446
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:13.000
Proving residency is a bit more lenient because again, they retain their residency just like the military members do.

447
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Thank you very much.

448
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Any other questions for the director?

449
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:26.500
Seeing none, any other people out there who wish to testify who are not on the list?

450
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.500
Hold on.

451
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.500
Representative Sykes has his hand up.

452
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.000
Yeah, Representative Sykes, go ahead.

453
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Thank you, Mr.

454
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Chairman.

455
00:44:38.000 --> 00:45:05.000
I just want to echo the clerk's comments that I would like to see her and the other sponsors of this bill get together with DMV to see if there can be an amendment introduced that will achieve the purposes of making driver's licenses more readily available to members of the foreign diplomatic corps.

456
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Chair agrees.

457
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Representative Crawford.

458
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Thank you Mr.

459
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Chairman.

460
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Director Berlecki, are you still on?

461
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.500
Yes, I am, Representative Crawford.

462
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:25.000
Do you have any written testimony to send to me on this bill?

463
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000
I don't, but I can summarize it and send it to you.

464
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
That would be wonderful.

465
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Thank you so much.

466
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Sure.

467
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Thank you.

468
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Okay.

469
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Seeing no more questions, I will close House Bill 78.

470
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.500
And for the record, three opposed to this bill.

471
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.500
And seven supporters of this bill.

472
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:56.500
And seven supporters of this bill.

473
00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.000
No, let me rephrase that.

474
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
No, two opposed.

475
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Two opposed.

476
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Yeah, seven support.

477
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Mr.

478
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.500
Chairman, may I ask a quick question before we move on?

479
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.500
I've already closed it.

480
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.500
It's not about that bill, sir.

481
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.500
Okay, go ahead.

482
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:26.000
And I don't know if we could ask Chairman Walsh when he returns.

483
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:55.500
I'm just curious, when we're all in the LOB and there are members of the public following along with the hearing, and we see someone from a department sitting in the audience who could possibly contribute and answer a question, and we'll often make eye contact or the chair will ask if, say, Director Bielecki could answer a question.

484
00:46:55.500 --> 00:47:01.500
Are we allowed to inquire if someone's in the zoom waiting room?

485
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:11.500
If they could please answer questions from say state police or DMV, even though they haven't signed up to testify?

486
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.500
Yes.

487
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.500
Thank you., everybody.

488
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.000
Just give me a minute to reset.

489
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.500
We'll go right into our next hearing.ありがとうございました Thank you.

490
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.500
Okay.

491
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.500
Okay.

492
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.500
Okay.

493
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.500
Okay.

494
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.500
Okay.

495
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:43.500
We've been open a public hearing on House Bill 329, an act relative to storage rail cars containing hazardous materials.

496
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.000
The sponsor is Representative Thompson.

497
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Is he signed on?

498
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
I don't have my screen up.

499
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
See everybody.

500
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
I just promoted them.

501
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Good morning, representative.

502
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Can you hear us?

503
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Yes, I can.

504
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
The floor is yours.

505
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Good morning, Mr.

506
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Chairman and members of the committee.

507
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.500
I'm Representative Dennis Thompson of Stewartstown, New Hampshire, representing Coas County District 1.

508
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:19.000
I'm a Republican and sponsor of House Bill 329.

509
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:34.500
So I've put forward in the bill, this would control storage and passage of cars, railroad cars, basically tank cars containing hazardous materials as described by the Federal Railway Safety Act.

510
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:51.500
Specifically, in the north country, in the towns of North Stratford and Columbia, we have a lot of these cars on a state-owned siding which has been leased to the New Hampshire Central Railroad.

511
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.500
They've been there over a period of time.

512
00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:08.500
I will tell you that in the last two days there's been a dramatic movement of these cars that have been stored up here for months.

513
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:20.500
we assume but do not know that they are either full or empty um these cars that have been stored up here for months.

514
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:27.000
We assume but do not know that they are either full or empty.

515
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:40.000
House Bill 329 addresses that in requiring, in addition to the placarding which the federal government requires, which describes the contents of any of these cars.

516
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:52.000
The only way the public would know would be if they looked it up online or had a hazardous placards manual available to them.

517
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:59.000
I've requested that the cars be placarded with full or empty stickers with signage.

518
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:13.500
A fairly simple thing to do either with a sticker or a cardboard sign that could be removed if the cars leave the storage area and go on rail.

519
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:24.000
It does allow for a 72-hour storage of cars that are part of a gathering train, term used by the railroad.

520
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:35.000
It would limit the storage of these cars within 1,500 feet of an occupied dwelling or 1,500 feet of a traveled way.

521
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000
I submitted testimony and some photographs.

522
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:50.500
I don't know if the committees received them, but many of these cars recently have been stored within 35 to 50 feet of occupied residences.

523
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.500
Some of these residents are concerned.

524
00:50:53.500 --> 00:51:03.000
They don't know if the proper precautions have been taken to protect them from the materials in the cars.

525
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:09.000
And unless evidence to the contrary is presented, we just don't know.

526
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
It's basically a very short bill.

527
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000
It requires the things that I've, I've, uh, I've listed.

528
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Um, the exceptions are if the cars are coming in to be delivered to a commercial or industrial, um, user in New Hampshire, they'd be exempt.

529
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Um, as long as they're, there for that reason If they're going to a propane storage facility that's licensed by whatever agency would license those, they'd be exempt as well as home heating oil, biodiesel, any of those.

530
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.500
Biodiesel, incidentallyally is not a hazardous material.

531
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:55.000
I believe that's about it.

532
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.500
If you have any questions, I'd be willing to answer them.

533
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.500
Thank you, sir.

534
00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:05.000
Any questions from the committee?

535
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Representative Gorski?

536
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Thank you, Mr.

537
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Chairman, and thank you, Representative Thompson for taking my question.

538
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:25.000
You mentioned in your bill that you want a placard which states, you know, full or empty as well as the contents.

539
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:32.000
My question is, who would be responsible for doing that posting of those signs?

540
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:46.500
My feeling would be that it would be the railroad, the local or national railroad that handles the cars and puts them into storage and takes them back out.

541
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.000
And a follow-up question, Mr.

542
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Chairman?

543
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Yep, for follow-up.

544
00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:10.500
And if they don't, what's your idea that if, let's say, the local railway doesn't do it, is there going to be an imposed penalty if they don't post a placard or signs on them?

545
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:25.500
This bill has been added under Section 18 of RSA 21P, which is an RSA that gives the state some authority to enforce general safety regulations throughout the transportation industry.

546
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:31.500
And whatever the penalties would be under that, I do not know.

547
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.500
Okay.

548
00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.500
Thank you, Representative Thompson.

549
00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.500
Any further questions from the committee?

550
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:44.500
I whatever the penalties would be under that I do not know.

551
00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.000
Okay, thank you representative Thompson.

552
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Any further questions from the committee?

553
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Yes.

554
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Representative Aaron.

555
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Thank you, Mr.

556
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Chair.

557
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Thank you, Representative Thomas.

558
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:10.000
I have a question regarding what is your concern about any rail cars that had previous contents or are empty?

559
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Why would that be a concern with regard to, say, propane or heating oil?

560
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Can you explain that?

561
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
My specific concern is with propane.

562
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.500
Heating oil is, although flammable, is not necessarily explosive.

563
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:41.500
Although I understand any real cars containing these type of materials, if exposed to a sufficient amount of heat, could blev is the term used when a railroad car explodes.

564
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:59.000
You may be familiar with, in 2013, July of 2013, in Lake McGonagall, Quebec, there was a train that got loose from the braking system, subsequently went seven miles downhill on a track and exploded.

565
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:08.000
That carried crude oil, and crude oil is probably the least offensive of the flammable and explosive oils.

566
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:32.500
But the result in that event that event was 47 people were killed 2 000 people were displaced from their homes and businesses and the majority of the downtown of lake mganic quebec was destroyed in fire and as to this day not really been ever recovered from it.

567
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:40.000
In the case I'm stating in my district, these cars appear to be all propane.

568
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:56.000
And I understand from the research I've done that even when you empty one of these cars, there is up to 250 or 300 gallons of liquid material left in the car.

569
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:10.500
when you leave a gaseous liquid gas in an open space like that, and it's not open, it's confined in the car, but the liquid material then becomes gaseous.

570
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:28.500
At that point, if the car were impinged and there were sparks involved hit by a tractor trailer or whatever, the car would be as explosive as it would be if it was full of liquid.

571
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:35.000
The liquid is more stable than the gaseous material is, is my understanding.

572
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Follow up.

573
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Follow up.

574
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Thank you for that.

575
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:52.500
And I also have a question as to whether there's ever been a problem or incident in New Hampshire with these rail cars.

576
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.500
Not that I'm aware of now.

577
00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:57.500
Thank you.

578
00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.500
Okay.

579
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.500
Any further questions from the committee?

580
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.500
I see Representative Cleaver.

581
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.500
Thank you, Mr.

582
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:10.500
Chairman, and thank you for taking the question.

583
00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:19.500
Do you know if this is covered under the National Transportation Act or the Federal Department of Transportation?

584
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:27.500
There is some coverage under the Federal Rail Act, but there is also under 49 U.S.C.

585
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.500
201-06, there's an exception.

586
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:34.000
And if I may, I'd read it to you.

587
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.500
It's just a paragraph long.

588
00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:48.500
It says a state may adopt or continue to enforce a law, regulation, or order covering the same subject matter as a DOT regulation.

589
00:57:48.500 --> 00:58:09.500
when an additional or more stringent law, regulation, or order is necessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local safety or security hazard, is not compatible with law, regulation, or order of the United States and does not unreasonably burden interstate commerce.

590
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:28.500
I think that these situations, and I understand we have them up here, we have them in, have or have had them in Walpole, as well as in the Lebanon area, and possibly other places in the state.

591
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:44.000
So I think that this bill is not overreaching the federal, it is maybe overreaching the federal regulation because we're trying to protect the local hazard or prevent the local hazard.

592
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
All set.

593
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Okay.

594
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.500
I have the questions from the committee.

595
00:58:51.500 --> 00:59:02.000
Please keep in mind, we've got several other people signed up to testify and we better make up a little time.

596
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.500
Seeing none, thank you very much, Representative.

597
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.500
Thank you, Mr.

598
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.500
Chairman.

599
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:19.000
Next up,'ve got Christopher Wagner representing Marigas Propane in opposition he signed up to speak for three minutes Mr.

600
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:25.500
Wagner you've got the floor for three minutes he just he's on mute.

601
00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.000
Oh wait, there he goes.

602
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Mr.

603
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Wagner.

604
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
Thank you, Mr.

605
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Chairman.

606
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Mr.

607
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.500
Chairman and esteemed members of the House Transportation Committee.

608
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.000
My name is Christopher Wagner.

609
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:59.500
I serve as the Director of Compliance and Regulatory Affairs for Amerigas Propane LP and am honored for the opportunity to testify before the committee on their behalf today.

610
00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:06.000
Amerigas opposes House Bill 329 and respectfully asks the committee to vote no.

611
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:16.500
I have submitted a detailed written testimony in advance of this hearing and intend to supplement that with a brief statement.

612
01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:26.000
Amerigas is the largest propane retailer in the United States, serving over 1.5 million customers in all 50 states.

613
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:39.000
In the service of our customers, we distribute approximately 1.1 billion gallons of propane annually, with over 21.5 million of that being distributed in New Hampshire.

614
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:48.000
The state of New Hampshire supply needs are highly reliant on the transportation of LP gas by rail.

615
01:00:48.000 --> 01:01:04.000
It is also important to recognize that over 70 percent of the volume delivered within the state occurs between the months of October and March, which makes effective staging of resources critical.

616
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
The rail industry is not immune to delays or stoppages.

617
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.500
This can affect the supply chain and ultimately the residents of New Hampshire.

618
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:24.500
It is also for this reason that effective supply chain management and staging of resources is so critical.

619
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:50.000
Imposing the restrictions proposed in this bill on this critical supply chain resource increases the risk of supply outages and increases the vulnerability of the supply chain during the coldest months of the year and during inclement weather periods, precisely when New Hampshire's propane customers need security and supply the most.

620
01:01:50.000 --> 01:02:04.500
Propane is a critical resource to the state of New Hampshire for heat, hot water, cooking, backup power for our schools, healthcare facilities, emergency responders, and even cellular communications.

621
01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:13.500
For these and many other reasons, we respectfully request that the committee vote no on House Bill 329.

622
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500
Mr.

623
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:29.500
Chairman and esteemed members of the House Transportation Committee, I thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today and would be happy to answer any questions.

624
01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.500
Thank you, sir.

625
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.500
Any questions?

626
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.500
Representative Adam?

627
01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.500
Thank you, Mr.

628
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.500
Chair.

629
01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.500
And thank you, Mr.

630
01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:44.000
Wagner, for coming to testify.

631
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.500
I'm interested to know, between the months of October and March, it's basically colder weather.

632
01:02:51.500 --> 01:03:07.000
So can you tell me the difference in perhaps the level of danger or volatility that propane may pose in being stored in rail cars in New Hampshire in those months?

633
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.500
Thank you for your question, Representative Aaron.

634
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:14.500
Vapor pressures are completely dependent on external temperature.

635
01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:25.000
So the atmospheric temperature at any particular moment impacts the vapor pressures within a propane rail car or bulk storage tank.

636
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:35.500
In that, we expect to have far lower vapor pressures within a rail car during those colder months of the year.

637
01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:48.000
There are safety devices that are built into and integrated into rail cars that allow that rail car to measure and adapt to interior pressures.

638
01:03:48.000 --> 01:04:07.500
But at that point in the season, there's relatively no internal pressures within those rail cars or extremely limited internal pressures within those rail cars, just based on the atmospheric temperature and the conditions that are surrounding those cars.

639
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.500
Oh, yes.

640
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.500
Thank you.

641
01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.500
Thank you, Mr.

642
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.500
Chair.

643
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:19.000
And so thank you for that, Mr.

644
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Wagner.

645
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:29.500
And also my question, I have a question about with these rail cars sitting where they do.

646
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:38.500
and I understand the need for staging and being in a given particular place at any particular time.

647
01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.000
What about security for these rail cars?

648
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:50.500
How do you protect them from being tampered with or potential terrorist activity, that kind of thing?

649
01:04:50.500 --> 01:05:06.000
So rail car security and the security of infrastructure is largely managed through the Department of Transportation through specific regulations and guidelines associated with protection of inventory and commodities in transportation.

650
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:17.500
And anybody that transports a hazardous material is required to have a DOT security plan and program in place that includes in-transit security.

651
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:21.500
Part of this is through monitoring of railcars.

652
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:31.500
It's through effective securement, sealing of railcars, and the application of a specific seal on the railcar to prevent tampering.

653
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:36.000
Evidence of tampering is easily detectable through that process.

654
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:52.500
And the FRA is pretty specific with their expectations of continued monitoring of rail cars in transit, as well as the Department of Transportation with all other means of transportation of hazardous materials.

655
01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:55.000
Okay, thank you for that.

656
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.500
Okay, I see Representative Cleaver, last question for this.

657
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.000
We have 20 other people signed up.

658
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.500
I'm sure they can answer your questions.

659
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:12.000
Thank you very much, and thanks for taking the question, Mr.

660
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Wagner.

661
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:38.500
I know the times vary tremendously, but on average, during the winter months, what would you say is the average time for storage of rail cars, and what would you say is the average time for storage of rail cars and what would you say is the longest time?

662
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:42.000
Thank you for that question, Representative Cleaver.

663
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:49.000
That is a very difficult question to answer specifically because of all the variables.

664
01:06:49.000 --> 01:07:11.500
We have experienced, unfortunately, in the past, substantial delays in delivery of rail cars based on increased demand, as well as unforeseen occurrences, such as the Canadian rail strike or bridges, rail bridges that have been removed from service through flooding and other heavy storms.

665
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:31.000
So the propane industry attempts to react to that and ensure that those shortfalls are not experienced in the future because they are so detrimental to the citizens of New Hampshire, as well as all across the United States.

666
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:50.500
So in attempting to forecast what demand is going to be, measure weather patterns, we can expect to have rail cars that are in transit and may be temporarily stored within a location at all different degrees of variation.

667
01:07:50.500 --> 01:08:17.500
It's very difficult to be able to put a specific that this is reasonable or that is reasonable, just based on the fact that it really does come down to what the weather patterns are, what the potential restrictions are, and what other commodities are being shipped on the rail at any given moment.

668
01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:36.500
But I think our rail partners would probably be better able to provide you with more specific information of what they see as their potential storage needs in temporary storage while awaiting delivery to a propane distribution point.

669
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.500
All right.

670
01:08:38.500 --> 01:09:03.500
Seeing none, thank you for your testimony sir uh and actually next up might be somebody who can answer just those types of questions uh cynthia scarano looks like uh from pan am railways uh opposed to the bill uh requesting five minutes, but I'm going to give you three.

671
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.500
Welcome Cynthia Scarano.

672
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.500
I am here.

673
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.500
Good morning.

674
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.500
I think three will be fine.

675
01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:21.500
I think the propane industry did a lot of discussing of issues that we have combined with them.

676
01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:29.000
But if you give me a few moments, I'd like to give you some testimony.

677
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Fantastic.

678
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Thank you.

679
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:45.000
So, Chairman and members of the Transportation Committee, my name is Cynthia Scurano, and I am the Executive Vice President of Pan Am Railways.

680
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I would like to thank you for the opportunity to testify against House Bill 329, regulating the storage of rail cars containing hazardous materials.

681
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:13.500
The bill is concerning to Pan Am and the rail industry for many reasons, but the two I would like to focus on today are safety and sufficient energy supply in New Hampshire.

682
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:18.000
I have worked in my position for 12 years.

683
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:37.000
During the 12 years, I have had numerous discussions and meetings with New Hampshire officials regarding necessary steps needed to be taken to ensure the sufficient propane supplies reach New Hampshire, thereby meeting its heating and energy needs.

684
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Working closely with our propane customers, we have been able to develop a system that utilizes storage and rail cars so that sufficient supplies are on hand during high demand times such as cold snaps and severe storms.

685
01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:11.500
In this bill, if If this bill were to pass and be found enforceable, there is no question that the supply chain for the propane into New Hampshire would be stressed.

686
01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:30.500
On average, a propane car is loaded at a facility in Ohio, Michigan, wherever in the United States, and it takes from three weeks later to arrive on the Pan Am Railways Network, under the best of circumstances.

687
01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:43.000
If there was some sort of interruption, adverse weather, track issue, cruise shortage, mechanical failure, strikes, bridges, then delivery could take four weeks or more.

688
01:11:43.000 --> 01:12:01.500
The way we have avoided these interruptions affecting household consumers is to have enough cars on our system to feed the storage facilities and keep up with demand while more propane is making its way across country.

689
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:07.500
Last year, Pan Am Railway shipped over 7,450 car loads of propane.

690
01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:26.000
If we are no longer allowed to place cars along our system for longer than 72 hours, awaiting the need for delivery into facilities, rail transit will no longer be able to keep up with this demand.

691
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.500
Which brings me to the second major concern regarding this bill.

692
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:44.500
Whether it's chlorine used in water treatment plants or propane used to heat homes, schools, hospitals, and other facilities, rail is the safest form of transportation.

693
01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:56.000
I have included a white paper published by the Association of American Railroads with my testimony that you can read at your leisure.

694
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:09.500
Some of the points I would like to highlight, though, is the fact that more than 99.9% of rail hazmat shipments reach their destination without a release.

695
01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:17.500
Railroads, including ourselves, have FRA inspectors examine rail infrastructures regularly to ensure compliance with federal standards.

696
01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:25.500
Pan Am conducts weekly inspections of every piece of track and yearly inspection utilizing ultrasonic technology.

697
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.500
Our employees participate in regular training.

698
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:32.500
PANAM has a rigorous drug and alcohol program.

699
01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:37.500
Employees are subject to random testing, which all employees understand.

700
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:42.500
PANAM has a zero tolerance for drug and alcohol use.

701
01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:54.500
Our safety department performs training classes and participates in yearly drills with first responders on preparation in the rare event of a rail accident.

702
01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:57.500
Safety is our number one priority.

703
01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:05.500
House Bill 329 will reduce safety by requiring constant movement of hazardous materials in rail cars.

704
01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:16.500
The House Bill also brings about inconsistencies in regulations causing confusion and possible incidents for our employees, the community and our company.

705
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:20.500
For example, the representative had spoke about placarding.

706
01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:23.500
Railroads do not do the placarding.

707
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:27.000
The shippers placard what's in their cars.

708
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:35.500
And a propane tank car, for example, is considered loaded until it is properly flushed and clean.

709
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:52.500
So even if it's what you and I in the outside world would consider empty, that placard will still say that it has material in it because the placards are for your first responders.

710
01:14:52.500 --> 01:15:03.000
So you want to make sure that they are aware that those cars have or do not have product within them.

711
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:42.500
Forcing the shuffling of cars every 72 hours takes a safely stored car out of our system and put for no other reason to move it around so that it is not in violation it is our opinion that house bill 329 creates a risk in the shipment of hazardous materials that would otherwise not be there we respectfully request that you deny house bill 329 and i'm happy to answer any questions thank you miss grano seeing Guarano.

712
01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:47.500
Seeing no questions from the committee, thank you very much.

713
01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:54.000
I gave you a little bit more than three, but thank you again.

714
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Thank you, Representative.

715
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.500
We do have to get back on track, hopefully.

716
01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:08.000
I'm not trying to cut anybody short, but we're getting it to the point now.

717
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:32.500
Everybody's opposed, so I assume we're going to start hearing the same information uh next up patrick hurley from the new hampshire department of transportation who is opposed um also asked for three minutes the sponsor of the bill is trying to get back on mine he's kicked off.

718
01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:35.000
I can't get it either.

719
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Thank you, Mr.

720
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Chairman.

721
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.500
Can you hear me now?

722
01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.500
Good morning.

723
01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:46.000
We can hear you now.

724
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Thank you.

725
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
For the record, my name is Patrick Herlihy.

726
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:59.500
I'm the director of Aeronautics, Rail and Transit at the New Hampshire Department of Transportation.

727
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:11.500
As you mentioned, we come today to oppose House Bill 329 as introduced, which would regulate the storage of rail cars containing hazardous materials.

728
01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:24.500
New Hampshire DOT owns approximately 195 miles of active railroad corridors that are currently operated by four freight rail operators and two tourist excursion rail operators.

729
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:42.000
One of those freight rail operators that was mentioned previously is the New Hampshire Central Railroad, which stores rail cars, which are considered stored in transit, that are either empty or full with hazardous materials.

730
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.500
Our opposition is twofold to this bill.

731
01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:57.000
In most instances, the regulation of railroads and property use for railroad purposes is governed exclusively by the federal government through the U.S.

732
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Surface Transportation Board.

733
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:07.000
As railroad operations are considered interstate commerce, any such state laws may therefore be federally preempted.

734
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:16.500
The purpose of federal preemption is to prevent a patchwork of local regulations from unreasonably interfering with interstate commerce.

735
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:37.000
So for example, the rail cars that are stored by the New Hampshire Central Railroad, which are considered stored in transit, would be considered railroad operations and therefore could be preempted by federal regulations as part of being normal railroad operations.

736
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:47.500
Secondly, New Hampshire DOT is concerned with the enforcement responsibilities that may become incumbent upon the Bureau of Rail and Transit.

737
01:18:47.500 --> 01:19:01.000
Understanding that this would be an amendment to RSA 21P, it would seem that that enforcement would fall on state police, highway patrol, or other enforcement entities.

738
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:10.000
State police really have not been enforcing or patrolling railroad corridors here in the state of New Hampshire.

739
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000
That's been under the purview of the Bureau of Rail and Transit.

740
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:38.500
So if it's incumbent upon the Bureau to do some kind of enforcement for this bill, we currently have minimal railroad staffing and would require additional staff in order to patrol over 400 miles of privately owned and state-owned active railroads or active railroad corridors.

741
01:19:38.500 --> 01:20:04.000
We certainly, New Hampshire DOT certainly appreciates concerns regarding the storage of hazardous materials, but as you've heard from others today, the regulatory and safety aspect that's already been given or used by the federal government and also by local authorities has made this as safe as it possibly can be.

742
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
And with that, I can take some questions.

743
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.500
I'll be happy to take some questions.

744
01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.500
Thank you.

745
01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.500
Thank you, testimony.

746
01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.500
I see one question.

747
01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.500
Representative Gorski.

748
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.500
Thank you, Mr.

749
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.000
Chairman, and thank you, Mr.

750
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.500
Hurley, for taking my question.

751
01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:36.000
You mentioned that you have minimal staffing right now and would require more staffing if this bill was passed.

752
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:47.500
Can you give us a ballpark of what's minimal staffing mean now and what would you need for additional staffing if this passed?

753
01:20:47.500 --> 01:21:00.500
What I need for additional staffing, I'm really not quite sure because we would have to see what this, how we would patrol those 440 miles.

754
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:09.000
Minimal staffing to me means I have a, in my railroad unit, I have a railroad planner.

755
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I have an operations engineer who inspects projects that are done along the state-owned railroad lines.

756
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
And I have a railroad inspector and investigator.

757
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:39.500
And that inspector is responsible for going out to make sure that the railroad lines themselves are in adequate shape and that the inspections have been done by the railroads to operate on our state railroad lines.

758
01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:48.000
And that person also goes out for any accidents or incidents that happen along the railroad lines.

759
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Okay thank you.

760
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Thank you.

761
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.500
Seeing no other questions thank you Mr.

762
01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.500
Hurley.

763
01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.000
Thank you very much Mr.

764
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.500
Chairman and members of the Transportation Committee.

765
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:14.500
Okay next up I'm going to go with Edward Jeffrey, New Hampshire, representing New Hampshire Central Railroad Incorporated, opposed to the bill.

766
01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:17.000
And he's requested zero minutes.

767
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:23.500
So I'm going to be fair and I'm going to give you two.

768
01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.500
Are you there, Mr.

769
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.500
Jeffrey?

770
01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.500
Is he still muted?

771
01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.500
No, he's unmuted.

772
01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.500
Mr.

773
01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:36.000
Edward, can you hear us?

774
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.500
Maybe he really did want zero minutes.

775
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.500
It's Edward Jeffrey.

776
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.500
Yep.

777
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.500
Mr.

778
01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.500
Jeffrey.

779
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.500
Going once.

780
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.500
Going twice.

781
01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.500
Mr.

782
01:22:53.500 --> 01:23:00.000
Jeffrey, if you are having issues, you can try again at the end.

783
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
But we need to move along.

784
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.500
So next up, I'm going to go with Mr.

785
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:32.500
Robert Scully, representing the New Hampshire Motor Transport Association, also opposed to the bill, and is asking for three minutes say you there mr scully mr chairman can you help me can hear you now good morning good morning thank you mr chairman members of the committee i'll be brief.

786
01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.500
I know you're busy.

787
01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:37.000
I will not repeat myself.

788
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.500
I'm the president of New Hampshire Motor Transport Association.

789
01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:50.500
I appear in opposition to House Bill 325 for many of the comments that have already been raised.

790
01:23:50.500 --> 01:24:03.500
I also appear on behalf of the Energy Marketers Association of New Hampshire, and that is all our propane dealers in the state of New Hampshire.

791
01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:21.000
And I just use this winter weather that we're having as an example of if we had supply interruption, what it would mean to your constituents in your homes, to homeowners, small businesses, hospitals, schools.

792
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:32.000
You cannot predict what is going to happen with the weather and what a great need or demand that might be increased.

793
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:53.500
And this fuel that we're talking about, very specifically propane, is in those rail cars so that this industry and the state can meet the needs of the customers and its people to keep folks warm and safe and comfortable in the winter.

794
01:24:53.500 --> 01:25:04.500
And I'll just bring you back to three or four years ago when we had a deep freeze for over three weeks.

795
01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:25.000
This, my office was working with the governor and his folks fielding phone calls from around the state of New Hampshire, because we couldn't get, it was a great need or demand for people to get fuel to keep themselves warm.

796
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.500
So we met that need.

797
01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:42.000
But if we did not have the ability to get the product where it was staged, to get the customers, there were folks that would have went without heat.

798
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:52.000
So I'll leave the rest of it to you for anyone else from the industry that can ask specific questions.

799
01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:12.500
But I view this bill as extremely harmful to the end users of the product that really take sometimes for granted that their houses and business and schools and hospitals are going to get the product they need to keep warm.

800
01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.500
So thank you, Mr.

801
01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.500
Chairman.

802
01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.500
Thank you, sir.

803
01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:22.000
Seeing no questions, I'll thank you again.

804
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:32.500
And next up, Thomas Manson, a member of the public opposed to the bill, like to testify as requested three minutes.

805
01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.500
Are you there, Mr.

806
01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.500
Manson?

807
01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.500
Leads on mute.

808
01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:41.000
Can you hear me, Mr.

809
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Chairman?

810
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
You can now, good morning, sir.

811
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Good morning, Mr.

812
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Chairman and members of the committee.

813
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Thank you very much.

814
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.500
My name is Tom Manson.

815
01:26:55.500 --> 01:27:05.000
I'm the CEO of Eastern Propane and Oil, and I'm here to testify in opposition to House Bill 329.

816
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.500
Also scheduled to testify this morning, Mr.

817
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:15.000
Chairman, on behalf of Eastern is Bob LaFave, our Vice President of Supply.

818
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:35.500
In the interest of time and with your permission, included in my testimony, I would read his brief statement regarding the specifics of the effect of House Bill 329 on our rail terminal, if that would be acceptable to the committee.

819
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:44.500
He is available to answer any specific questions you may have about how we operate our rail terminal.

820
01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.500
Yeah, what was his name again?

821
01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.500
His name is Bob Lefebvre, L-E-F-E-V-V-R-E.

822
01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.500
I've got him there.

823
01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:55.500
I think that would be fine.

824
01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:58.500
It helps to save some time.

825
01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:05.000
If there are any questions for him, we can reach out to him.

826
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
So thank you.

827
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Wonderful.

828
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Thank you, Mr.

829
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Chairman.

830
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:21.500
As I said, I am the CEO of Eastern Propane and Oil, headquartered in Rochester, New Hampshire.

831
01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:26.500
I'm also a citizen of New Hampshire, living in Newcastle.

832
01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:35.000
Eastern Propane and Oil is a fourth generation family business with our headquarters in Rochester, New Hampshire.

833
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:43.000
We serve 56,000 customers in New Hampshire meeting their fuel needs, primarily propane and heating oil.

834
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.500
We have 380 employees in New Hampshire.

835
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:53.500
We have offices in Rochester, Wolfboro, Tamworth, North Conway, Hudson, Loudon, Enfield, and Claremont.

836
01:28:53.500 --> 01:29:05.500
We have 16 storage facilities for fuel in New Hampshire, including a 900,000-gallon propane storage facility, a rail terminal in North Rochester, New Hampshire.

837
01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:20.500
Our concern is that House Bill 329 would adversely affect the operation of the facility and our ability to efficiently and effectively provide fuel to our customers in New Hampshire.

838
01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:36.500
And now I'll turn, if I might, to the testimony of Bob LaFave, who is responsible for managing all of our supply facilities, including our rail terminal in North Rochester, New Hampshire.

839
01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:39.000
And he was his statement.

840
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Good morning, my name is Bob Lefebvre and I'm here this morning to voice my opposition to House Bill 329.

841
01:29:49.000 --> 01:30:05.000
One of my responsibilities as Vice President of Supply for Eastern Propane is to maintain adequate inventory levels at our 900,000 gallon rail facility for propane storage located in Rochester, New Hampshire.

842
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:18.000
This terminal processes upwards of 24 million gallons of propane annually, equating to roughly 800 rail cars, with each car containing approximately 30,000 gallons of propane.

843
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:30.500
The terminal and the rail cars we bring in play a key role in allowing us to serve our customers with propane as demand warrants.

844
01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:38.500
We use this facility to load our delivery trucks, which in turn fuel the customers' tanks.

845
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:46.000
Our propane is used to service hospitals, schools, government buildings, manufacturers, businesses, restaurants, and homes.

846
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:55.500
The customers use the propane for emergency generators, heating, cooking, hot water, clothes drying, auto gas, and other uses.

847
01:30:55.500 --> 01:31:09.000
Propane rail cars are not an on-demand commodity, meaning we can't pick up the phone or send an email and have the cars at our terminal tomorrow.

848
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:25.500
From the time you order a rail car to the time it arrives, it can take up words of 15 days depending on where it is in the country it was shipped from.

849
01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:36.500
It takes planning to ensure we have adequate product on hand to meet the demand of the customers, especially in peak season.

850
01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:54.000
At times, the railroad can have and has had issues being able to move rail cars for a variety of reasons, and it's in those times we rely on the cars we have on hand.

851
01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:10.500
By having the ability to store cars at the terminal, it guarantees we'll have the product to help avoid disruption or at least to help bridge the gap until rail service is restored.

852
01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:17.000
There is not an endless supply of rail cars in the supply chain.

853
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:30.500
We are always unloading the cars as quickly as possible, which allows us to get them back to the supplier to be reloaded for the return trip.

854
01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:44.000
Should this bill be enacted, the provisions contained would greatly impact supply security by limiting the number of cars we have on hand at any given time.

855
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.500
I'll end on this note.

856
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:56.500
For every rail car that enters the state of New Hampshire, it keeps three 18-wheel transports off New Hampshire highways.

857
01:32:56.500 --> 01:33:03.500
In our case, Eastern keeps roughly 2,400 transports off New Hampshire highways each year.

858
01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:20.500
Should we be limited to the amount of rail cars we can bring to our terminal, we would have no other choice but to start hauling more of the product by means of transports.

859
01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:27.500
I thank you for allowing me to speak in opposition to House Bill 329.

860
01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.500
Mr.

861
01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:34.500
Chairman, members of the committee, thank you for your time.

862
01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:38.000
And that concludes my testimony and Mr.

863
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.500
LeFave's testimony on behalf of Eastern Propane and Oil.

864
01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:45.000
Thank you very much, sir.

865
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Seeing no...

866
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.500
Can you send that testimony?

867
01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.500
Oh, did you...

868
01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:55.500
Have you provided the committee with written testimony?

869
01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:57.500
We have not.

870
01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:05.000
I just received this this morning, but we can certainly do so after the fact.

871
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.500
If you could forward it, that would be great.

872
01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.500
Thank you, sir.

873
01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.500
You're quite welcome.

874
01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:17.500
I'm seeing no questions, so thank you again.

875
01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.500
Have a great day.

876
01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.500
Yeah, you as well.

877
01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:27.500
Move on to Leslie Anderson, a member of the public representing herself.

878
01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:29.500
She is opposed.

879
01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:32.500
Perhaps this could be a mistake.

880
01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:35.000
Also asking for zero minutes.

881
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.500
Could have signed up wrong, but if you're there, Leslie Anderson.

882
01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:45.000
I can see you, but you're still on mute.

883
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Can you hear me now, Mr.

884
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Chairman?

885
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
I can, good morning.

886
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Good morning, thank you.

887
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.500
Good morning, Chairman Walsh and members of the committee.

888
01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:15.500
My name is Leslie Anderson, and I'm president of the Propane Gas Association of New England, and I thank you all for the opportunity to offer our comments in opposition of House Bill 329.

889
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:21.000
The Propane Gas Association is a regional alternative energy trade association.

890
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:33.500
We represent members of the propane industry, including the two you've heard from today, as well as many small family-owned businesses here in New Hampshire.

891
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:39.500
Over 40 propane marketers in your state and more than 2,700 employees.

892
01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:46.000
We exist to serve the industry by promoting safety, education, and public awareness.

893
01:35:46.000 --> 01:36:00.500
Propane is a recognized clean alternative fuel by EPA under the 1990 Clean Air Act, and it's essential as a backup for our ever-increasing use of the electrical grid.

894
01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:07.500
Using clean propane energy accelerates decarbonization and access to clean propane ensures environmental equity.

895
01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:16.000
We oppose House Bill 329 as it would threaten the health and safety of New Hampshire's citizens.

896
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:27.500
We rely on propane rail cars in New Hampshire to supply over 230,000 residential customers as well as critical public services and businesses.

897
01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:38.000
Rail transportation is the most economical, the cleanest, and the safest method to supply propane to our infrastructure throughout the state.

898
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:53.000
As you've heard, there will be train delays due to storms in the winter due to heavy snow, natural disasters like floods that wash out rail bridges or collapse tunnels.

899
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.500
Rail strikes in Canada have caused disruptions in the last years.

900
01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:11.000
And for these reasons, the railroads and our rail customers have built in additional supply to ensure that they have a working inventory readily available.

901
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.500
Our average working inventory is seven to 10 days of supply.

902
01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:36.500
And by doing this, we make sure that the propane industry not only provides warm heating and hot water to New Hampshire's businesses year round into the homes, but also to protect the state's energy security and its resiliency needs.

903
01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:49.000
Using rail cars reduces the number of trucks on our state highways, as one rail car is equal to three large 18-wheeler transport trailer trucks.

904
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Rail reduces the burden of vehicles on the state roads and highways, and it lowers the risk of vehicle incidents.

905
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:20.000
We estimate that this bill would add millions of dollars in infrastructure costs to our members in the form of additional tractor-trailer trucks, which they would have to buy if they could not use the rails that they use currently for inventory.

906
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.500
And these trucks run $350,000 to $400,000 a piece.

907
01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:41.500
We also estimate that this bill would add an additional 15 cents per gallon to consumers for the cost of product due to increased transportation costs if we couldn't use the efficiency of rail.

908
01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:51.000
Propane is not only an EPA certified alternative fuel but we're also a federally certified emergency civil defense energy.

909
01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:10.500
When winter storms, natural disasters or pandemics call for portable energy or backup energy generators or cell phone tower energy so that we can communicate throughout the state, propane is the one that steps in and saves the day.

910
01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:25.000
Whether it's a small outdoor restaurant heating with outdoor space with propane barbecue tank or a large hospital or school using propane to heat and as backup power generation.

911
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Residents need it to boil water and cook food when their power is out.

912
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:41.000
So propane is there to supply clean, reliable energy and is an important part of New Hampshire's plan.

913
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:50.000
We do suspect that there are several aspects of this bill that would be preempted by federal regulations.

914
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.500
I'll let the others on the call speak to that issue.

915
01:39:55.500 --> 01:40:19.500
But in conclusion, I'd just like to say that to ensure the safety of our citizens when there are electrical disruptions and storms, climate disasters, and even cyber terrorism, it's really essential that the state promote the energy infrastructure and transportation of sustainable green resilient energies like propane.

916
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:33.000
So for these reasons, we respectfully request the committee to vote no on House Bill 329, and I would be happy to answer any of your questions.

917
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Thank you very much.

918
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I see no questions, so thank you again.

919
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.500
Do you have any written testimony you can provide the committee?

920
01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:46.500
I do.

921
01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:49.500
I've emailed it to the committee.

922
01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.500
Oh, you did?

923
01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.500
Okay.

924
01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:56.000
Thank you very much again.

925
01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.500
That's the last person I've signed to speak up.

926
01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:08.500
I'll go back one more time to Edward Jeffrey, if he's still there, in all fairness.

927
01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:13.500
Well, that's three attempts, so I'll make note of that.

928
01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:23.500
On the rest of our sheet, signed up by also in opposition, is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

929
01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:28.000
Seven more members of the public, six more opposed.

930
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.500
Representative Leishman is also opposed.

931
01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:33.500
And we have a neutral, Mr.

932
01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:35.500
Eric Rathburg.

933
01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:38.000
I'll see you next time.

934
01:41:38.000 --> 01:42:14.500
more um opposed representative leishman is also opposed and we have a neutral uh mr eric rathburg um so with that i'm going to close the public hearing on house bill 329 give us a few minutes to reset and mr greenland if you can send me a refresh link i'm hearing a couple of people who have problems getting bounced out they won't let me it It says the webinar has expired.

935
01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:19.500
So if it should be another one, that'd be great.

936
01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:25.000
All right, I will send that over to you right now.

937
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Thank you.

938
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
So now to reset.

939
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
What?

940
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Between here.

941
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Between here.

942
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.500
Yeah, we're a half hour.

943
01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:41.000
I thought I was up at 10.30.

944
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Yeah.

945
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
You're early.

946
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Yeah, you're early.

947
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Because we're early.

948
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Thank you.

949
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Thank you.

950
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Sound check.

951
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Can everybody hear me?

952
01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.500
Can I hear you well?

953
01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.500
Okay.

954
01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:04.500
Is Howard Pearl on the line?

955
01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.500
Representative O'Hara?

956
01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:08.500
My computer's not working.

957
01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:10.500
There he is.

958
01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:12.500
Good morning.

959
01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:14.500
All right.

960
01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:16.500
Can you hear me?

961
01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:18.500
Good morning.

962
01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:21.500
Chairman, can you hear me okay?

963
01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.500
I can now.

964
01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.500
Good morning.

965
01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:27.500
All right.

966
01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.500
Good morning.

967
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:33.500
Chairman Walsh and members of the Transportation Committee.

968
01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:38.500
I am here this morning to introduce House Bill 279.

969
01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:42.500
For the record, my name is Howard Pearl.

970
01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:51.500
I'm representative from Merrimack 26, covering the towns of Loudoun, Bosquin, Northfield, Canterbury, and Ward 3 of Franklin.

971
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:58.000
First off, I want to wish a happy birthday to Vice Chair Gagney.

972
01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.500
I can't believe he's 77.

973
01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:25.000
all right so good morning i'm here to as i said to to introduce house bill 279 a bill that would allow a higher tandem axle weight for tractor trailers hauling forest products i emailed out an amendment yesterday to the whole committee i I hope you received it.

974
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Amendment 2021-0319H.

975
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Department of Safety requested that I make slight language change to better clarify the goals of the bill.

976
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:47.000
So if you've got that, it generally is the same as the original bill, except it's a little bit more clarifying language.

977
01:44:47.000 --> 01:45:04.000
So I worked with the Commissioner of Safety, Commissioner Quinn, Sergeant Burke, and the New Hampshire Motor Transport Association and the Timberland Owners Association to craft the language that you have in this bill.

978
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:17.500
There's been some issues with, especially with the folks hauling wood chips over the roads, they've been running into some problems and complying with the current language.

979
01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:29.500
So as you can see, the language is very specific about what vehicles it would allow the exception to or the weight change exception.

980
01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:51.500
And the part that the amendment adds is for purposes of this subparagraph, raw forestry products means unprocessed logs and wood chips harvested from forest land as defined, excuse me, in RSA 227 G2 section 8 that have not previously been moved off site.

981
01:45:51.500 --> 01:46:23.500
And the reason we added that language and that safety requested it is we wanted to make sure that this only applied to loads that were coming off the log landing and not loads that had gone to say a reloading site because those loads can be metered and loaded properly in order to make sure that they're complying with the axle weight restrictions.

982
01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:49.500
The situation occurs mostly, almost completely with loads that are coming off from the log landing, and especially with these loads of chips that have been blown into a tractor trailer, and they're not able to properly get that load in the right places in order to comply with the current statute.

983
01:46:49.500 --> 01:47:01.000
So this language, the way it's presented with the weight rating at 40,000, would put us in line with the state of Maine.

984
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:08.500
Maine is currently at 44,000, but with our statute, we have a 5% overage allowance.

985
01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:24.000
So by putting it at 40,000 with the 5% overage allowance, Allowance Department of Safety felt this would get us to 44,000 and they'd safely be able to still manage that.

986
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:35.000
And the Timbaland owners felt that the 44,000 weight would solve virtually all of the issues that their members have been having.

987
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
I looked at Vermont as well.

988
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Vermont is even higher.

989
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
It's at nearly 50,000.

990
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.000
I felt that and Department of Safety felt that that wasn't necessary.

991
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.500
So we stopped at the current language of 40,000.

992
01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:57.500
The low-grade forestry industry in New Hampshire is struggling already.

993
01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:05.000
This bill will leave an unnecessary hurdle for them to get their product to market.

994
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:13.000
I know you will receive some testimony from Department of Transportation that they had some concerns.

995
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:33.000
So in regards to their concerns about the damage to our roads and bridges, it is my belief that New Hampshire roads and bridges are built to the same standards as our neighboring states to the east and the west.

996
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:44.000
The trailers of wood chips that are loaded on site are not easy to divide to meet the current axle weight restrictions.

997
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:51.000
The forest industry has tried many different techniques to achieve compliance to no avail.

998
01:48:51.000 --> 01:49:10.500
I know you're running late, so in closing, I'll reiterate that I'm not looking to increase the overall weight of the vehicles, just the distribution of weight for this very narrow use that has demonstrated the need for relief.

999
01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:36.500
With that, I will take any questions from the committee, and I'll just say that there's a couple other folks that are coming up to testify as well that if you have some technical questions, they may be their industry representatives and they may be better qualified to answer than I am.

1000
01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.500
Thank you.

1001
01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:40.500
Appreciate the time.

1002
01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:46.500
Jason Stott, the Hitcher Timbaland Ores Association in support is seeking formance.

1003
01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:48.500
Give us a start.

1004
01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:51.500
The support is seeking four minutes.

1005
01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:53.500
Okay.

1006
01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:55.500
Can you hear me?

1007
01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:57.500
You can.

1008
01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:59.500
Good morning, sir.

1009
01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:01.500
Okay.

1010
01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:03.500
Good morning.

1011
01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:06.000
The system's a little glitchy.

1012
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:13.000
When you called my name, I got bumped off the meeting and then reintroduced.

1013
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:18.000
So I was not asleep at the switch, I guess.

1014
01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000
So for the record, this is Jason Stock.

1015
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000
I'm with the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association.

1016
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.500
And I want to thank Representative Pearl for introducing this bill.

1017
01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:41.000
And I also want to thank the folks at the Department of Safety for helping us work on it.

1018
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:49.000
As Representative Pearl indicated in the forest products industry, hitting axle weights can be very difficult.

1019
01:50:49.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Most trucks that are hauling across the road, these are the tractor trailer style truck, they're certified to 99,000 pounds and whether you're blowing chips into the truck or you're putting logs on it you know attaining that gross vehicle weight you can you can usually get pretty close particularly with the 10 overage but where it gets difficult is when you're trying to hit those particular, those specific axle weights, especially over the drive axles.

1020
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:34.000
And so this bill will go, will help resolve that, help resolve that issue.

1021
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:40.000
The current axle weight limit for a tandem axle is 36,000 pounds.

1022
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:51.500
As Representative Pearl said, it's 40,000 in Maine and of course, or 44,000 in Maine and in Vermont, it's as high as 50.

1023
01:51:51.500 --> 01:52:00.500
I've heard for many, a number of years that, you know, truckers say it just doesn't make sense.

1024
01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:13.000
I load a truck up let's say I load a truck up in Vermont I'm legal I that truckers say it just doesn't make sense.

1025
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.500
I load a truck up.

1026
01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:20.000
Let's say I load a truck up in Vermont.

1027
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
I'm legal.

1028
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.500
I cross the Connecticut River.

1029
01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:26.500
I'm illegal.

1030
01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:31.500
And then I cross into Maine and I'm legal again.

1031
01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:35.000
I said, this just doesn't make sense.

1032
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.500
And it's really, it's not a gross vehicle weight.

1033
01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:42.500
It's a, it's that axle weight.

1034
01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:58.500
And what makes it tricky is when you're on a log landing, it is not like a dooryard or a, you know, the yard of a trucking facility that's paved and level.

1035
01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:04.500
You're on a surface that is usually there's some slope to it.

1036
01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:08.500
it's a it's a soil so you's soil.

1037
01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:23.500
And so, you know, trying to hit those axle numbers and haul a legal load at 99,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, again, it's near impossible to hit those axle weights.

1038
01:53:23.500 --> 01:54:24.000
Our feeling is let's get consistent with with main um this and it will make it just seems to make sense and i know i have i think i have one trucker on the line today that can speak to this he hauls in all three states um and he can kind of give a little bit of the history about when you know know, the original axle weights were set up, you know, we were looking at a bridge formula of 80,000, we now can go certified 99,000, and that's great, but the axles didn't, the axle weights, what he's telling me is they didn't change, so despite the additional 99,000 pound payload, 99,000, yeah, we still have this axle.

1039
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:33.000
So again, I appreciate the help from Representative Pearl and the Department of Safety in putting this together.

1040
01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:38.000
And I'd be happy to try and answer any questions.

1041
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:49.000
And hopefully my guy who's on the road, he assured me he would be pulled over for the hearing and call in.

1042
01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Hopefully he's able to make it and he can answer more specific on the ground questions.

1043
01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
But again, I appreciate the opportunity to testify.

1044
01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
I hope you'll support this bill.

1045
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.000
And again, I'll try to answer any questions.

1046
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Thank you, sir.

1047
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.500
Seeing no questions, thanks again.

1048
01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:25.000
Next up, we will go with Errol Peters, a member of the public, representing himself in support of the bill, only asking for two minutes.

1049
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:30.000
I'm going to have to start holding people to this.

1050
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Are you there, Mr.

1051
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Peters?

1052
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.500
I am not seeing him.

1053
01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:41.000
If you can raise his hand, that might help.

1054
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
He's not online?

1055
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I don't see him.

1056
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Fair enough.

1057
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Okay.

1058
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:55.500
Next, we'll go with Robert Scully from the New Hampshire Motor Transport Association.

1059
01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.500
In support.

1060
01:55:57.500 --> 01:55:59.500
Asking for three minutes.

1061
01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:01.500
Oh, there he is.

1062
01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.500
I got one second.

1063
01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:05.500
There we go.

1064
01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:07.500
Mr.

1065
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:10.000
Chairman, can you hear me?

1066
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Good morning again.

1067
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Good morning.

1068
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:29.500
Just for note, the previous hearing I testified on, I was removed from the Zoom meeting, and I had a very difficult time getting back on here just for future reference.

1069
01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:35.500
So, you know, so I missed the previous speakers on this bill.

1070
01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:38.500
I'll try to be very brief.

1071
01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:43.000
I appear in support of this piece of legislation.

1072
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:54.500
And just to put it in perspective of what we're asking for and support is an extremely small segment of the trucking industry.

1073
01:56:54.500 --> 01:57:04.000
We're only talking about forest products coming off the land to have an equity in the axle weight system.

1074
01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:40.500
Currently today, these trucking companies that perform this service can legally have a load of 99,000 pounds and, however, have their axle weight be over the 36,000 pounds and it usually happens on the drive axles so we met with the department of safety with representative pearl who introduced the legislation we did our best to come up with a recommendation that worked for the industry and was still safe on the highways.

1075
01:57:40.500 --> 01:58:00.000
And our best opportunity to do that was to mirror what they have in the state of Maine to try to fix what we view as an inequity for a, once again, a very small segment of the industry.

1076
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:08.500
There are no other portions of the trucking world that I represent that is asking for this.

1077
01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:14.000
It is just the forest products that come off the land.

1078
01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
We're trying to fix a problem Thank you.

1079
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:24.500
portions of the trucking world that I represent that is asking for this.

1080
01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:30.000
It is just the forest products that come off the land.

1081
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:42.000
We're trying to fix a problem where they can legally be at maximum weight, but still be receiving a citation for maximum axle weights.

1082
01:58:42.000 --> 01:59:12.500
And if in fact, we mirror what we have in the state of Maine and you distribute the axle weights appropriately on the tires and on the truck itself, then as far as I'm concerned in reading the letter from the Department of Transportation, we are properly riding with a legal load and spreading out any potential damage to the road.

1083
01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:22.500
So we don't agree with their assessment, and we would ask the committee to kindly consider support of this legislation.

1084
01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:24.500
Thank you, Mr.

1085
01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:26.500
Chairman.

1086
01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:28.500
Thank you, Mrs.

1087
01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:30.500
Kelly.

1088
01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:33.000
Any questions from the committee?

1089
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Representative O'Hara?

1090
01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I would just like to apologize to Mrs.

1091
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Kelly.

1092
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:48.000
I was clicking the wrong button when I was taking people off of panelists.

1093
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Thank you.

1094
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.500
I just didn't want to miss it.

1095
01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:55.500
All right.

1096
01:59:55.500 --> 01:59:59.500
Seeing all the questions, thank you again, sir.

1097
01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:01.500
Yeah.

1098
02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:05.500
Last up, we're going to go with Mr.

1099
02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:08.500
Rodriguez from the Department of Transportation.

1100
02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:10.500
They are opposed.

1101
02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:14.000
I see he's done it for five.

1102
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.500
If you could speed that up, good morning, sir.

1103
02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:24.500
Thank you very much for making time to hear my testimony today.

1104
02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:39.500
I do have prepared testimony, but before I start, I want to make an illustration of what we would call the difference between a distributed load and the point load.

1105
02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:54.000
When we talk about a fully loaded vehicle and we distribute the load among many axles, we equal out those point loads so no point load is too high.

1106
02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:07.500
When we're talking about axle loads, we're talking about direct point loads in a single location that has a significantly different effect on a road or bridge.

1107
02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:23.000
So to use a forest analogy, if you're splitting wood, you have a piece of wood, you hit it with the blunt end of a sledgehammer, you probably won't split it.

1108
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:34.000
But if you hit it with the sharp end of the mall or the axe, you're going to split that Thank you.

1109
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000
hammer, you probably won't split it.

1110
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:52.500
But if you hit it with the sharp end of the mall or the axe, you're going to split that wood because you're concentrating all of that force in one location.

1111
02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:55.500
And that's what axle weights do.

1112
02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:58.500
They're concentrating forces at one location.

1113
02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:11.000
And And that's why higher axle loads impact our bridges and roads differently than an overall vehicle load that distributes that load over many axles.

1114
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:23.500
So the department's testimony is HB 279 proposes a change in RSA 266-B, weight on non-interstate and general highway system for vehicles with additional registrations.

1115
02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:35.000
So this is a subset of our vehicles that we allow to run heavier than our regular vehicles already due to this certification.

1116
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:55.500
HB 279 would provide a carve-out for forest products, allowing a combination of truck tractor and single semi-trailer with four or more axles that is carrying forest products to increase the weight on any tandem axle from 36,000 to 40,000 pounds.

1117
02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:59.000
This equates to an increase of 11%.

1118
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:11.000
And as was mentioned, that can be, there's a tolerance of 10%, which means that axle load can now be up to 44,000 pounds.

1119
02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.500
The Department of Transportation opposes this bill.

1120
02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:28.500
Passage of this House bill will impact the posting of bridges in New Hampshire, a road safety factors, and increase the deterioration of existing bridges and roadway pavements.

1121
02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:36.500
We also have concern that this could lead to demand for similar treatment from other industries.

1122
02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:48.000
These are divisible loads, meaning a divisible load is a load that you meter by how much you put on a particular vehicle.

1123
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000
You can put more or less.

1124
02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:59.000
These are divisible loads and should be held to consistent limits currently set forth in statute.

1125
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:05.000
New Hampshire laws restrict the weight of vehicles for two major reasons.

1126
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:16.500
The first reason the laws limit the weight of vehicles is that vehicles are designed and built to safely carry a finite weight.

1127
02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:31.500
Distribution of that weight affects different safety things such as steering, braking, stability, and other safety characteristics, as well as the overall ability of the vehicle to carry the loads.

1128
02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:35.500
Department of Safety is expert in those factors.

1129
02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:51.500
The second reason the laws limit weight is that our roads and bridges are engineered to support specific loads from the vehicles, and the Department of Transportation is expert on these factors.

1130
02:04:51.500 --> 02:05:01.000
New Hampshire's roadway network is comprised of a series of roads, including state and local highways and back roads.

1131
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:06.500
Our interstates are relatively modern, with highly engineered roadways and bridges.

1132
02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:23.500
They are also more highly regulated when it comes to weight to protect the federal taxpayers' significant investment and to preserve the nation's ability to move commerce and defense assets across the country uninterrupted.

1133
02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:38.000
RSA Section 266.18B exercises New Hampshire's choice to increase the allowable weight of vehicles on New Hampshire's non-interstate system that is not as tightly regulated from a federal level.

1134
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:49.500
So what we're saying, we let heavier vehicles drive on our less engineered and less built local roads as opposed to the interstates.

1135
02:05:49.500 --> 02:06:06.000
Unfortunately, while some of the non-interstate system is made up of highly engineered roadways and bridges, much of this system is made up of roadways that have never been formally engineered or constructed.

1136
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Many of the state and local bridges on the non-interstate system are old and were built to carry much lighter vehicles and travel on them today.

1137
02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:38.500
The load increase proposed in HB 279 will have the greatest effect on our shorter, older bridges, which were designed for lower loading standards, and on the pavement on our state and local roads that were never formally constructed.

1138
02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:50.500
Fortunately, New Hampshire DOT has a sophisticated bridge inspection program and the ability to rate all our state and local bridges for specific loads.

1139
02:06:50.500 --> 02:06:53.000
The department post Thank you.

1140
02:06:53.000 --> 02:07:01.500
bridge inspection program and the ability to rate all our state and local bridges for specific loads.

1141
02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:10.000
The department posts state bridges and directs towns to post their bridges that cannot support specific loads.

1142
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:23.500
Passage of HB 279 would require the department to spend approximately 7,700 hours to reanalyze and rate all the state's bridges for these proposed higher axle weights.

1143
02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:34.000
And as a result, this will almost certainly lead to the posting of additional bridges, increasing the number of E2 postings.

1144
02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.500
The following graphic explains the E2 posting.

1145
02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:43.500
The E2 posting prohibits all certified vehicles from crossing the posted bridge.

1146
02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:53.500
Passage of this bill will prohibit all certified vehicles from these additional posted bridges, not just trucks carrying forest products.

1147
02:07:53.500 --> 02:08:21.000
So if this bill passes, we will have to reanalyze all of our bridges, and we will have to post bridges to prohibit all trucks in this classification from passing additional structures, meaning it doesn't matter if you're a forest truck, a gravel truck, a milk truck, you won't be able to cross that bridge.

1148
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
In addition to posting...

1149
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Mr.

1150
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Rodriguez.

1151
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Yes.

1152
02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:32.500
Yeah, I don't mean to interrupt, sir.

1153
02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:39.000
I finally recognize the fact that you're actually just rereading your written testimony.

1154
02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.500
We've all read it, I believe, already.

1155
02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:47.500
Do you have anything to add that you can summarize?

1156
02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:58.000
Because when you actually get into the graphs and pictures in it, obviously we don't have that in front of us.

1157
02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:05.500
So could you maybe summarize, and we can, like I say, reread the testimony ourselves?

1158
02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:07.500
Yes, absolutely, Mr.

1159
02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:09.500
Chairman.

1160
02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:21.000
And again, passage of this bill will require all trucks to take different routes in some cases where we have additional posted bridges.

1161
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:34.500
Finally, even though it's a small 10% increase in the weight of the axle, that has a one and a half times greater impact on our pavements.

1162
02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:50.000
Again, in the weight of the axle that has a one and a half times greater impact on our pavements, again, particularly for our back roads that were never formally constructed.

1163
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:53.000
And I'll take any questions, Mr.

1164
02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Chairman.

1165
02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.500
I see one question from Senator Barrett.

1166
02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:00.500
Thank you, sir.

1167
02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:02.500
Thank you, Mr.

1168
02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:04.500
Chair.

1169
02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:07.500
Thank you for your testimony, Mr.

1170
02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:09.500
Rodriguez.

1171
02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:28.000
So the previous person who testified said that they have a truck will come from Vermont, which is legal there, cross into New Hampshire, which would be illegal, and then go to Maine, which would be legal.

1172
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:38.000
So that leads me, a question as to why would Vermont and Maine consider those vehicles safe for their roads?

1173
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:48.000
I mean, are our roads in New Hampshire built to less of a standard than, say in Vermont and Maine?

1174
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:57.500
So, I, I, roads in New Hampshire built to less of a standard than, say, in Vermont and Maine?

1175
02:10:57.500 --> 02:11:07.000
So the roadways are very similar standards, and their roads will see higher deterioration based on those heavier loads.

1176
02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
That's a fact.

1177
02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:15.000
And in driving on some of those roads, we can see that.

1178
02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:25.500
The difference with bridges is, unfortunately, every state's loads are unique to a large extent, except on the federal highway system.

1179
02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:37.500
So when it comes to bridges and rating our bridges, each of us rate our bridges to our axle weight and vehicle weight laws.

1180
02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:50.500
So Vermont and Maine, as they analyze their bridges, they would consider these heavy loads and post vehicles from those bridges that they can't drive over.

1181
02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:57.500
We would need to redo that for New Hampshire bridges for these heavier loads.

1182
02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:59.500
Thank you.

1183
02:11:59.500 --> 02:12:01.500
Representative Borski.

1184
02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:03.500
Thank you, Mr.

1185
02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:06.000
Chairman, and thank you, Mr.

1186
02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.500
Rodriguez, for answering my question.

1187
02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:19.000
You mentioned that there's a lot of roads and bridges that could have some negative impacts if this bill was passed.

1188
02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:32.000
I'm not sure if you know this answer, but can you give us what percentage of roads or bridges could be impacted if this was passed?

1189
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:42.500
So the percentage of roads, all of our back roads that experience higher roads like this would be impacted by it.

1190
02:12:42.500 --> 02:12:54.500
When it comes to bridges, we're talking, we have to crunch your math, so this is gross estimation, we're talking about dozens, not hundreds.

1191
02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:56.500
Okay, thank you.

1192
02:12:56.500 --> 02:12:58.500
Senator Skes?

1193
02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:00.500
Yes, thank you, Mr.

1194
02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:02.500
Chairman.

1195
02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:04.500
Mr.

1196
02:13:04.500 --> 02:13:26.500
Rodriguez, in planning, the DOT has an estimate of what percentage of roads it's able to upkeep and repair over a given year and that number as I recall has been going percentage that they're able to do has been going down and down.

1197
02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:36.000
Will there be that kind of an effect if this bill passes making fewer roads being repaired on time?

1198
02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:49.500
So passage of this bill would not affect the rate at which we reconstruct roads and maintenance of the roads, pavements of the roads and so forth.

1199
02:13:49.500 --> 02:14:00.500
Passage of this bill would have a small effect on the condition of those pavements and the rates at which they deteriorate.

1200
02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:03.500
May I have a follow-up, Mr.

1201
02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:05.500
Chairman?

1202
02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:07.500
Follow-up, go ahead.

1203
02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:29.500
Yeah, but what you're saying is that the roads will be less, they'll take further, I don't know if this is the right word, but more wear and tear, and won't that push, put more pressure on the DOT to get roads repaired faster?

1204
02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:31.500
It absolutely will.

1205
02:14:31.500 --> 02:14:37.000
We already feel that pressure to repair and reconstruct roads quicker.

1206
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:40.500
We feel that pressure all the time.

1207
02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:48.500
Some of you who drive on many of our back roads likely feel that pressure too.

1208
02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:50.500
Thank you.

1209
02:14:50.500 --> 02:14:52.500
Okay.

1210
02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:57.000
Seeing no other questions, thank you very much, sir.

1211
02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Thank you, Mr.

1212
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Chair.

1213
02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:06.500
I believe that is our last person signed up to speak.

1214
02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:09.500
Is there anybody in the queue?

1215
02:15:09.500 --> 02:15:15.000
I believe that is our last person signed up to speak.

1216
02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Is there anybody in the queue, Representative O'Hara?

1217
02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
There is one.

1218
02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Hold on.

1219
02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:26.000
New Hampshire State Police, Bill Burke.

1220
02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Okay.

1221
02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:33.000
If you can queue them up, what was his name?

1222
02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Bill Burke.

1223
02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Okay.

1224
02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
What was his name?

1225
02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Bill Burke.

1226
02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Okay.

1227
02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Need to unmute.

1228
02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Mr.

1229
02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Burke.

1230
02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.500
Can you hear me sir??

1231
02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:53.500
Good morning.

1232
02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:55.500
Thank you.

1233
02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:59.500
It booted me off there for a second.

1234
02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:01.500
I apologize, Mr.

1235
02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:03.500
Chairman.

1236
02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:05.500
No problem.

1237
02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:07.500
It's all yours.

1238
02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:10.000
My name is Bill Burke.

1239
02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:14.000
I'm the assistant troop commander of Troop G.

1240
02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:23.500
We were asked to join a meeting with the New Hampshire Timbaland Association and the commissioner's office on this.

1241
02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:46.500
and the main question that was asked to the state police was, are the trucks capable of carrying this amount of weight and in our estimation the majority of trucks out there that do carry this type of product can carry this type of weight safely.

1242
02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:51.000
That was the question that was asked to us.

1243
02:16:51.000 --> 02:17:00.000
We agree with the Timbaland Association that it is an issue with the forestry, especially with wood chips.

1244
02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:06.000
They have a hard time regulating wood chips going into these trucks.

1245
02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:13.000
It's tough to do, and we do catch axle violations on them quite frequently.

1246
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:21.000
We're just trying to give them a little bit of reprieve on this type of issue.

1247
02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.000
I'm available for questions if you have anything from us.

1248
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.500
Senator Barron, thank you, sir.

1249
02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:30.500
Yes, thank you, Mr.

1250
02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:32.500
Chair.

1251
02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:34.500
Thank you, Mr.

1252
02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:36.500
Burke, for your testimony.

1253
02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:46.000
I'm interested to know that, you know, the vehicles that we're talking about now, they're certified overweight vehicles currently.

1254
02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:57.500
So what bridges are they allowed to use now, but would be eliminated from service because of the limited use of this exception?

1255
02:17:57.500 --> 02:18:01.000
Well, Representative Aaron, DOT posts the bridges.

1256
02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.500
We don't post the bridges.

1257
02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:21.000
We would have to catch them going over the bridge in order to hit them with a bridge violation, which we rarely have the opportunity to do that, catch them going over the E2 bridge.

1258
02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:24.500
Have we caught them in the past?

1259
02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:31.000
Yes, but it's not something that we grab a lot of the time.

1260
02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.000
If I'm answering your question correctly.

1261
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Thank you.

1262
02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:44.000
in the past, yes, but it's not something that we grab a lot of the time.

1263
02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.500
I'm answering your question correctly.

1264
02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:48.500
Thank you.

1265
02:18:48.500 --> 02:18:50.500
Okay.

1266
02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:52.500
Seeing no other questions.

1267
02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:54.500
Thank you, sir.

1268
02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:56.500
Thank you.

1269
02:18:56.500 --> 02:19:00.500
And I don't see any other hands up.

1270
02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:02.500
Any other hands up?

1271
02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:04.500
Representative O'Hara?

1272
02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:07.000
No, I don't see any.

1273
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Okay.

1274
02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
For the record.

1275
02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Let's see.

1276
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.500
No, I don't see any.

1277
02:19:15.500 --> 02:19:17.500
Okay.

1278
02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:38.000
For the record, we have in support and a member of the public, Eric Rathburn, our friend who is neutral on We have in support and a member of the public, Eric Rathburn, our friend who is neutral on this bill.

1279
02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:44.500
With that, I'm going to close the public hearing on House Bill 279.

1280
02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:47.500
Just a few minutes to reset.

1281
02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:49.500
Thank you.

1282
02:19:49.500 --> 02:19:51.500
Thank you.

1283
02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:53.500
Thank you.

1284
02:19:53.500 --> 02:19:55.500
Thank you.

1285
02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:57.500
Thank you.

1286
02:19:57.500 --> 02:19:59.500
Thank you.

1287
02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:04.000
Yeah, we're having glitches with the big screen here.

1288
02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Did they all hear the testimony?

1289
02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Did you hear the testimony at all from Representative Smith?

1290
02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
No.

1291
02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
You didn't hear it?

1292
02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
No.

1293
02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Okay.

1294
02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:23.000
I didn't know you even started.

1295
02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
We're taking a break.

1296
02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
That was a practice.

1297
02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.500
If you would repeat yourself.

1298
02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:36.000
I'll try, you know, I make this stuff up as I go along.

1299
02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:40.500
So, but yeah, I'll take another swing at it.

1300
02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:54.000
So, yeah, and the chair did open the public hearing and I am Representative Stephen Smith, Sullivan County District 11, Eckworth, Charlestown, Goshen Langdon, Lemster, and Washington.

1301
02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:06.000
In 2013, I brought forward a bill to try to get a group to work on a regulatory package for personal rapid transit systems.

1302
02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.500
These are small and lightweight.

1303
02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:25.500
If you want to see some examples of good working ones, look up Heathrow Airport PRT or Morgantown, West Virginia, where a similar type of white transportation system has been operating since the 70s.

1304
02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:33.500
That didn't go anywhere because I failed to show the legislature working models and viable projects.

1305
02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:42.000
Since then I've been contacted by manufacturers who would like to do these things and different modalities.

1306
02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:47.500
Many of you have heard of Dean Kamen some years ago.

1307
02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:56.000
He pitched a microchain proposal for the city of Manchester, which would not require bulldozing or blasting.

1308
02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:01.500
It's a small lightweight system that could have been put in.

1309
02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:04.500
He offered to pay for it.

1310
02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:16.000
And because of a failure to convey what it would actually look like and how it would be implemented, that never went anywhere.

1311
02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.000
And I'm trying to fix that.

1312
02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:30.000
So the different types of things that we need are for less populated parts of the state where we don't have masses.

1313
02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:36.000
So we can't have mass transit, but we still need public transportation.

1314
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:43.500
Personal rapid transit systems differ from conventional transportation in that they don't run around empty.

1315
02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:47.500
If nobody calls a car, no car moves.

1316
02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:49.500
That's distributed car software.

1317
02:22:49.500 --> 02:23:06.000
So the units on the network are staged so that you never have to wait more than 10 or 15 minutes, which is the cycle time of the New York City subway system.

1318
02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:14.500
And you press the button, the thing shows up, you swipe your card and off you go.

1319
02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:36.500
The only real estate you need for some of them is maybe access to a state highway right-of-way and room to put an 18-inch in diameter pole, and then they hang from a cable or rail, much like the gondolas at our ski resorts.

1320
02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:39.500
There's pneumatic tube technology for people.

1321
02:23:39.500 --> 02:23:45.500
There's a pilot project out in Las Vegas or somewhere in Nevada.

1322
02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:48.000
And that's kind of exciting.

1323
02:23:48.000 --> 02:24:52.500
So between the PRT systems, the micro rail, solar powered street car project in the Southwest, there's a lot of different ways to move people around that I don't think get enough interest, exposure, and we devolve into the fighting about subsidizing buses and trains thing so what i'm going to ask the committee to do is retain the bill and i will talk to the manufacturers and mr kamen who have talked to me about this and they will either come here before you and show you a project that convinces you this is worth looking at or not if that doesn't happen then it won't cost you anything because I imagine there will be no work sessions and I'll make the motion to ITL in October myself.

1324
02:24:52.500 --> 02:25:03.500
But think of the possibilities of getting not really cool 20th century technology, but actually looking to the 21st for a change.

1325
02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:10.000
And I hope you can support that and take the journey with me.

1326
02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Thank you, Representative Smith.

1327
02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.500
Could you highlight again that who's paying for this?

1328
02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:18.500
Who's paying for?

1329
02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:25.000
Who's going to be paying if these projects would get off the ground?

1330
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:30.500
Yes, these are private investors that want to build these things.

1331
02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:45.000
And they're taking a long view that whatever the cost to put them in, yes, they're going to need investors up front and also, frankly, some federal money available.

1332
02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:56.000
But that long term, once the federal money pays off the initial debt of the build, they're going to be collecting fares.

1333
02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:04.500
And the nice thing about these is maintenance on them is minimal on the classic PRT systems.

1334
02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:11.500
And also being solar powered, they don't have electricity generating bills or fuel costs.

1335
02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:14.000
So it's literally just maintenance.

1336
02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Keep them clean, keep them greased, and they keep running.

1337
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.500
So it's all private money.

1338
02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:29.000
So generally speaking, these things would turn a profit and we wouldn't have to subsidize.

1339
02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
That's the hope.

1340
02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Yeah.

1341
02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:38.500
Imagine if they can't profit from it, they have to subsidize.

1342
02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:41.000
That's what, that's the hope.

1343
02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Yeah.

1344
02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:48.500
Imagine if they can't profit from it, they won't build it.

1345
02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:50.500
Thank you.

1346
02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:53.000
Do you have any questions?

1347
02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Any committee members?

1348
02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Representative Gorski.

1349
02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Thank you, Mr.

1350
02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Vice Chairman.

1351
02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:05.000
And thank you, Representative Smith for this bill.

1352
02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:10.500
Let me ask, can you repeat those two examples you mentioned?

1353
02:27:10.500 --> 02:27:12.500
You mentioned Hawthorne Airport.

1354
02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:19.000
And what was the other example that we could take a look at?

1355
02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Heathrow Airport in England and Morganstown, West Virginia.

1356
02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:31.500
And I bring those up because the one in West Virginia has been there since the 70s.

1357
02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:37.000
And it's almost more light rail, so a super early version.

1358
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:47.500
Heathrow, that is a dedicated roadway system, so they built like concrete troughs for it, but the distribution software is state-of-the-art.

1359
02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:55.000
So those are two good things to kind of get your head around the concept.

1360
02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:10.000
You can also look up Transit X, all one word, the word transit with the letter X on the end, a Massachusetts company that has some very good concept drawings.

1361
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Thank you.

1362
02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Representative Talarski.

1363
02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Thank you, Mr.

1364
02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Chair.

1365
02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Representative Smith, can you just clarify, I want to make sure I understood you correctly, that you're hoping we retain this so we can work on a little bit more and get feedback from other industries?

1366
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Absolutely.

1367
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Absolutely.

1368
02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:58.000
So if they can't come here and pitch, I'm not going to lie, a couple of the companies I looked at I suspect are vaporware, so they have a concept but not an actual implementation package.

1369
02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:32.500
In order for them to actually convince us that we should spend our time on it, I want to see a guy come in here and say, I can do this for the UNH campus tomorrow or Dartmouth or Concord to connect the parking garages, you know, and then we can move forward and we can always amend the bill to create the regulatory parameters that will be needed.

1370
02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:58.000
If you were around when we did the Uber bill, when you have a new transportation technology, a challenge for a manufacturer is they want to know what the rules are, what regulations will they have to adhere to before they spend money, and frankly, what they can be sued for.

1371
02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:10.000
So if they come in and convince you, that could be an appropriate amendment for the bill prior to sending anything to the Senate.

1372
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:20.500
Or as I said, they won't show up, in which case it's an ITL, and we took a swing at it.

1373
02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:22.500
Thank you.

1374
02:30:22.500 --> 02:30:25.500
Any other questions from the committee?

1375
02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:27.500
Seeing none.

1376
02:30:27.500 --> 02:30:29.500
Thank you, Representative Smith.

1377
02:30:29.500 --> 02:30:31.500
Thank you, Mr.

1378
02:30:31.500 --> 02:30:33.500
Chair.

1379
02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:46.000
seeing as there are no other signed up speakers, is there anyone out there in the queue who would wish to speak on this matter?

1380
02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Yes, there's one that is John and or Betty Gay.

1381
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Okay.

1382
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:56.000
You need to unmute, Representative Gay.

1383
02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:10.500
Yes, and I put my hand up because I'm presenting the next bill, and this was the way I thought I was supposed to do it, so I apologize.

1384
02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:13.500
Steve's representative Smith's idea sounds fabulous.

1385
02:31:13.500 --> 02:31:15.500
Thank you.

1386
02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:17.500
Thank you.

1387
02:31:17.500 --> 02:31:19.500
Okay.

1388
02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:23.000
Seeing no further people in the queue.

1389
02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:28.500
There are those who chose not to testify in person here.

1390
02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:33.000
There are seven supporters, two opposed to this bill.

1391
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:37.000
And with that, I close House Bill 104.

1392
02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
A little closer.

1393
02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
To oppose.

1394
02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.500
Yeah, you want to see?

1395
02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:45.500
Thank you.

1396
02:31:45.500 --> 02:31:49.500
I thought I was going to get up.

1397
02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:52.500
Did you guys accept me anything?

1398
02:31:52.500 --> 02:31:55.000
I'm booked for the afternoon.

1399
02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
The window was now.

1400
02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:00.000
I saw the bill you found.

1401
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Thank you.

1402
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Thank you.

1403
02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Thank you.

1404
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Okay.

1405
02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:14.500
For some reason today, the main terminal keeps going on to mute mode.

1406
02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:19.500
Did anybody hear anything I said a few moments ago?

1407
02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:33.000
Okay, before we get started, I've got 11 people signed up to speak, all in opposition, anywhere from most of them from zero minutes requested to three.

1408
02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:36.500
So I'm going to pick three minutes.

1409
02:32:36.500 --> 02:32:42.500
I'm going to ask the vice chair to keep track of time.

1410
02:32:42.500 --> 02:32:56.000
I will ask everybody that signed up to speak, if you have provided the committee with written testimony, to please not just read it back to us.

1411
02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:02.500
I think most of us spent the night last night reading them all.

1412
02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:06.500
That being said, look for the prime sponsor.

1413
02:33:06.500 --> 02:33:13.500
And actually, if you didn't hear anything, I guess I need to start over.

1414
02:33:13.500 --> 02:33:25.000
when opened the public hearing in House Bill 587 relative to indicating citizenship or legal residency on driver's licenses and non-drivers identification cards.

1415
02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
So Representative Gay.

1416
02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Thank you Mr.

1417
02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Chairman.

1418
02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:34.500
I will be as brief as possible.

1419
02:33:34.500 --> 02:33:45.000
This is an issue that doesn't seem too related to transportation, except that our driver's licenses are issued by the DOT.

1420
02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:55.000
And I come from a background of election law, although I like being on health and human services now, too.

1421
02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:05.500
one of the difficulties in signing people up, registering people to vote, is that they have to show that they're citizens.

1422
02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:19.500
Well, if you can't show it on your driver's license, that means you have to go dig for your birth certificate or some other document that is official.

1423
02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:24.500
we use our driver's licenses frequently, mostly not for driving.

1424
02:34:24.500 --> 02:34:33.500
I mean, we have to have it for driving, but we mostly use it as our personal ID.

1425
02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:51.500
So, it would be so nice to put just in some kind of mark, and I did not specify exactly what kind because I wanted to leave that up to the people who actually do it.

1426
02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:58.000
So I found the phrase among other RSAs, an improved security marking indicating.

1427
02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:02.000
So it's either indicating citizenship or legal residency.

1428
02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:07.500
Those are the only people who can have a driver's license.

1429
02:35:07.500 --> 02:35:14.500
If you're illegal, you can't have one or you buy it from some fence.

1430
02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:19.500
So this is a very simple reason to have it.

1431
02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:38.000
It doesn't have to be big words splashed across, but it needs to be some symbol that the person registering people to vote can see so that they know whether it's legal to register them to vote.

1432
02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I think that's in a nutshell.

1433
02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:51.500
I've heard some of the opposition, but I'm really, really not happy with being accused of being prejudicial because of non-citizens.

1434
02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:58.000
I've had friends, even family, who married into the family who were non-citizens.

1435
02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:05.000
They didn't become citizens after they'd been here like, oh, 20 years at least.

1436
02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:09.500
So I don't see that as a prejudicial thing.

1437
02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:23.000
The other thing that shocks most people when I talk to them is they can't believe that our real ID looks exactly like a non-citizen's real ID.

1438
02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:37.500
I didn't know that until I was reading the description of how to get a real ID, or that you can't use it when you're applying for a passport.

1439
02:36:37.500 --> 02:36:39.500
I'll take any questions.

1440
02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:41.500
Okay.

1441
02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:43.500
Thank you, Representative Gay.

1442
02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:46.000
Any questions from the committee?

1443
02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Seeing none, I let you up.

1444
02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:52.500
I let a question now, Representative Talersky.

1445
02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:55.500
I'm sorry, I'll be very quick.

1446
02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:57.500
Thank you, Mr.

1447
02:36:57.500 --> 02:36:59.500
Chairman.

1448
02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:09.500
Representative Gay, I just wanna ask a quick question on the wording, how it says, including citizenship or legal residency.

1449
02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:23.500
So you're saying that this is for ease in voter registration, but if someone's a legal resident, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're a citizen and can vote.

1450
02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:28.000
So I guess I'm wondering why that is included.

1451
02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:42.000
I found out years ago working in a lab that it was always better to have something to look at than to look for the absence of something.

1452
02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:53.500
So one option would be using the absence method would just put some little symbol on a citizen, like an eagle or something.

1453
02:37:53.500 --> 02:38:00.000
Don't, you know, that's, I didn't put that in there for the reason.

1454
02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:05.000
So for a non-citizen, they should have a symbol too.

1455
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:12.000
The only people who can have licenses are legally here in the United States.

1456
02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:22.500
So they're either citizens or when I was looking it up, they are non-citizens who are either temporary or considered terminate.

1457
02:38:22.500 --> 02:38:29.000
So they could have a symbol and then citizens could have a symbol.

1458
02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:37.500
Something that doesn't jump out at you, but that's distinguishable by the person doing the voter registration.

1459
02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:40.000
May I follow up, Mr.

1460
02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Chair?

1461
02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Yep, follow up.

1462
02:38:44.000 --> 02:39:01.500
So Representative Gay, what you're saying is that there would be one mark for a citizenship clarification and then another mark if someone is simply here with a driver's license but it's a legal resident.

1463
02:39:01.500 --> 02:39:03.500
Yes.

1464
02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:14.000
Okay so we're talking about two different markings that would indicate that these people are safe drivers but have different classifications.

1465
02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Right.

1466
02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Just of citizenship.

1467
02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Yes.

1468
02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Thank you.

1469
02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
There's a question.

1470
02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
but have different classifications.

1471
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.500
Right, just of citizenship, yes.

1472
02:39:28.500 --> 02:39:30.500
Thank you.

1473
02:39:30.500 --> 02:39:32.500
Other questions?

1474
02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:35.500
Seeing none, thank you Representative Gaye.

1475
02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:37.500
Thank you.

1476
02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:42.500
Okay, I'm just going to go right down the list.

1477
02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:45.000
These are all in opposition.

1478
02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:55.500
So first, we look at looking for the chair recognizes Ken Barnes, representing himself, is opposed, is asking for zero time.

1479
02:39:55.500 --> 02:40:00.000
But as I said, I'll give everybody three minutes.

1480
02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.500
I do not see him.

1481
02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:07.500
If you could raise his hand, that would be helpful.

1482
02:40:07.500 --> 02:40:13.500
But other than that, I do not see Ken Barnes on there.

1483
02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:15.500
All right.

1484
02:40:15.500 --> 02:40:22.000
If you can keep an eye out for him, I'll check it out.

1485
02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:34.000
There's a possibility people signed in an error and hit the yes, not meaning to speak, but we'll keep an eye out for them.

1486
02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Next would be Stephanie Bray, representing the Hampshire Legal Assistance, also opposed, asking to testify, also asking for zero minutes.

1487
02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
Stephanie Bray.

1488
02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
There she is.

1489
02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.500
Hold on one second, please.

1490
02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:52.500
You have three minutes.

1491
02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:54.500
Once we get you.

1492
02:40:54.500 --> 02:40:56.500
You're still muted.

1493
02:40:56.500 --> 02:40:58.500
Thank you.

1494
02:40:58.500 --> 02:41:06.500
This body wisely voted two years ago to ITL a very similar bill, House Bill 471.

1495
02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:08.500
Hold on.

1496
02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:12.500
Can you please, for the record, identify yourself?

1497
02:41:12.500 --> 02:41:14.500
I'm sorry.

1498
02:41:14.500 --> 02:41:16.500
Sure.

1499
02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:21.500
I'm Stephanie Bray, and I'm from New Hampshire Legal Assistance.

1500
02:41:21.500 --> 02:41:28.000
Thank you for your patience as I work my way through the technology.

1501
02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:33.500
We are requesting that the committee recommend ITL for this bill.

1502
02:41:33.500 --> 02:41:43.500
We do not mark people's driver's licenses with P for Protestant or C for Catholic or UU for Unitarian Universalist.

1503
02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:55.000
And that's because our state constitution and the federal constitution both require that there be equal protection of the law for all persons.

1504
02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:13.500
And what that means is a state law that singles people out based on citizenship or other immigration status is treated the same way as a state law that singles people out on the basis of religion.

1505
02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:19.500
It gets looked at, that law gets looked at with strict scrutiny.

1506
02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:28.500
And that has nothing to do with the personal qualifications or attitudes of the people behind the bill.

1507
02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:47.000
And I mean no accusation against Representative Gay, but a law that singles out people based on their immigration status would be, it would be challenged on the basis, is there a compelling reason for the law?

1508
02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:52.000
And is this solution narrowly tailored to solve the problem?

1509
02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:58.000
And there really wasn't a compelling reason for this bill in 2019.

1510
02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:01.500
There is really no compelling reason now.

1511
02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:14.500
If people go to register to vote, you only do that once, or you change your residency and move to another town, you do it again.

1512
02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:27.000
it's not a big burden to come up with what's necessary to demonstrate your citizenship and a driver's license isn't enough to do that anyway.

1513
02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:32.500
You're going to have to come up with a birth certificate.

1514
02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:43.000
So marking a driver's license with a flag for citizens and something else for non-citizens really does not achieve that purpose.

1515
02:43:43.000 --> 02:44:00.500
What it unfortunately would achieve, not through anyone's intention in passing the bill, but what it would achieve would be increased scrutiny on the people who hold the driver's license that doesn't have the eagle.

1516
02:44:00.500 --> 02:44:03.000
And that is very concerning.

1517
02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.500
And that's all I have.

1518
02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:10.000
And I yield the floor and welcome any questions.

1519
02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Thank you very much.

1520
02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.500
Any questions from the committee?

1521
02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:16.500
Seeing none.

1522
02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:18.500
Thank you very much.

1523
02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:20.500
Have a great day.

1524
02:44:20.500 --> 02:44:22.500
Thank you.

1525
02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:24.500
Okay, down the list.

1526
02:44:24.500 --> 02:44:28.500
Chair recognizes Asma Aluni, lobbyist representing herself, opposed.

1527
02:44:28.500 --> 02:44:33.500
Did not seek any time, but same three minutes applies.

1528
02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:36.000
Once we can find her.

1529
02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.500
I do not see her.

1530
02:44:38.500 --> 02:44:42.500
If she could her hand if she's there.

1531
02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:48.000
So, Loni, if you're there, you need to raise your hand.

1532
02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:52.500
I don't see her on the attendee list either.

1533
02:44:52.500 --> 02:44:57.000
So, all right, I'll, I'm going to hold off.

1534
02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:21.500
We'll go back at the end for any of the ones that are on the list that we didn't get to uh next up the chair recognizes maggie fogerty um representing american friend service committee new hampshire also opposed to the bill miss fogerty if we can find you.

1535
02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:24.500
I do not see her either.

1536
02:45:24.500 --> 02:45:29.000
Well, I guess they were serious about zero minutes.

1537
02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Mr.

1538
02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Chairman, excuse me.

1539
02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:41.000
I see one of the people you called have their hand raised in the waiting room.

1540
02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Which one is that?

1541
02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
Asma Elhouni.

1542
02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Oh, okay.

1543
02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
I see now.

1544
02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
Thank you.

1545
02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
We'll go back.

1546
02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Okay, there she is.

1547
02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Need to unmute.

1548
02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Asma Elhouni.

1549
02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
Can you hear me?

1550
02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
You can now.

1551
02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
Good morning.

1552
02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Good morning.

1553
02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:18.500
Yeah, I had my hand raised when you asked me to raise my hand, so I'm wondering if that's happening with Maggie, too.

1554
02:46:18.500 --> 02:46:21.000
My name is Asmael Huni.

1555
02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:28.500
I am with Rights and Democracy New Hampshire, a grassroots organization that promotes human rights.

1556
02:46:28.500 --> 02:46:31.500
We stand strongly against HB 587.

1557
02:46:31.500 --> 02:46:44.500
This bill is not only racist, but also xenophobic and sends a dangerous message to our community members that New Hampshire is truly unwelcoming to immigrants.

1558
02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:52.500
As an immigrant myself, I'm appalled that such a bill is back up again in legislation.

1559
02:46:52.500 --> 02:47:08.500
Immigrants already have it hard, already being so different, and particularly immigrants of color, they're targeted and discriminated against, and this bill will make it likely for discrimination to continue to happen.

1560
02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:16.000
The defense of this bill is ridiculous, preposterous, and not substantial on any grounds whatsoever.

1561
02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:39.000
So, for example, when I go to a pharmacy and cashiers ask me because of age restrictions, like like items for cough syrup or cigarettes or alcohol, et cetera, that require a photo ID, that cashier should not be privy to my personal immigration status, right?

1562
02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.000
But this bill would give that information to her, right?

1563
02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:49.500
As far as voting, the Secretary of State knows our status.

1564
02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:56.000
When someone is registered to vote, they must present their social security number.

1565
02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Right.

1566
02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:03.000
And so that that that is going to verify citizenship.

1567
02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:15.000
So if someone did present a fake ID, it's up to the secretary of state to confirm whether that person is registered to vote.

1568
02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:18.000
And it is indeed a citizen.

1569
02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Right.

1570
02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:36.500
And so no other agency should be observing voter registration like that, because when we register to vote, they already make sure and they're not using our license as a form of ID.

1571
02:48:36.500 --> 02:48:38.500
They're using other things.

1572
02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:48.500
Also, additionally, there's no evidence in the state of New Hampshire where a non-citizen presented a fake ID to vote.

1573
02:48:48.500 --> 02:48:55.000
So we shouldn't be acting like this is a problem in our state.

1574
02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:58.500
So this bill singles out community members.

1575
02:48:58.500 --> 02:49:11.500
It is unnecessary and absolutely needs to be defeated just as it was defeated in 2019 for our community members in the state of New Hampshire.

1576
02:49:11.500 --> 02:49:13.500
Thank you very much.

1577
02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:17.000
If you want to take any questions.

1578
02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
Seeing none.

1579
02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Thank you very much.

1580
02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.500
Thank you for your testimony.

1581
02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:26.500
Should we try Maggie Fogarty again?

1582
02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:30.500
Representative O'Hara, if we can scan through this.

1583
02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:33.000
I am not seeing her.

1584
02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Okay.

1585
02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Well, we'll keep her checked off.

1586
02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:48.500
Chair recognizes Jean Husker from the ACL of New Hampshire, and I am here to testify in opposition to HB 587.

1587
02:49:48.500 --> 02:50:00.000
And we share the concerns previously expressed that the unintended consequence of this bill is to turn driver's licenses into tools of discrimination.

1588
02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:04.000
Driver's licenses are intended to enhance public safety.

1589
02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:10.500
They ensure that people operating motor vehicles are properly trained to do so.

1590
02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:17.000
They're not intended to denigrate people or apply a hierarchy to granite staters.

1591
02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:39.000
And yet if we add some sort of marking that says here's a group that are citizens and here's a group that's not, it sends a message that granite staters who carry and present licenses without the approved citizenship marking are somehow lesser than.

1592
02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:47.000
This bill invites discrimination by conveying citizenship on ID cards that are used nearly every day.

1593
02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Vote, you vote once every two years, maybe once every four years.

1594
02:50:53.000 --> 02:51:15.500
Think of how often you present your driver's license for a whole host of other things, whether it's purchasing cigarettes or alcohol or going into events, whether it's at your bank, your pharmacy, when you rent a place and you show it to your landlord.

1595
02:51:15.500 --> 02:51:18.000
I get the election concern.

1596
02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:33.500
I don't agree with it, but I just really worry that you use licenses for so many other reasons and to be sharing immigration status for all of those other encounters.

1597
02:51:33.500 --> 02:51:37.000
We really worry about the discriminatory effect.

1598
02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:49.000
I'd also add that adding a citizenship requirement to obtaining a driver's license or ID card could actually increase the cost of doing so.

1599
02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
A U.S.

1600
02:51:51.000 --> 02:52:06.500
passport, which is the preferred form of proof of citizenship, costs $135 for a first-time applicant, which may help explain, by the way, why only 41 percent of Americans have one.

1601
02:52:06.500 --> 02:52:19.500
Birth certificates can be less expensive to obtain, but just as burdensome for Americans who have moved away from the state in which they were born.

1602
02:52:19.500 --> 02:52:30.000
Given the difficulty in obtaining proof of citizenship, it's inevitable that some Granite Staters will be unable to provide such documentation.

1603
02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:34.500
And I'd ask you, what happens at that point?

1604
02:52:34.500 --> 02:52:45.500
If a Granite Stater cannot afford a passport or procure their birth certificate, is the default to assume that they're a non-citizen?

1605
02:52:45.500 --> 02:52:50.000
Does that end up going on their driver's license?

1606
02:52:50.000 --> 02:53:02.500
Given how necessary driving is in our state, we should not be making it more difficult and expensive for granted staters to obtain a license.

1607
02:53:02.500 --> 02:53:18.000
And I would just note, again, going back to the crime sponsors discussion about elections, our governor and secretary of state have both applauded our elections, including the security of elections.

1608
02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:34.000
I have not heard a single concern from our secretary of state or from our governor about false driver's licenses or about difficulties in voters proving their citizenship for purposes of voting.

1609
02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
I will wrap up.

1610
02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:46.000
I don't see a problem that this bill solves and we really do worry that it'll actually create more problems.

1611
02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:53.000
So I appreciate the opportunity to testify and I'm happy to answer any questions.

1612
02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
Thank you very much.

1613
02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.500
Any questions from the committee?

1614
02:53:57.500 --> 02:54:17.000
Seeing none you again thank you mr chair chair recognizes viola katasumi i'm trying to pronounce it um katasimi uh representing the granite state organizing project opposed to the bill let me Let me see if I find her.

1615
02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
Okay.

1616
02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
You're still muted.

1617
02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Hello?

1618
02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.500
I can hear you now.

1619
02:54:25.500 --> 02:54:28.500
Good morning, members of the committee.

1620
02:54:28.500 --> 02:54:33.000
Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak.

1621
02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:37.000
For the record, my name is Viola Tatsime.

1622
02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:41.000
I work for the Guardian State Organizing Project.

1623
02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:51.000
We are a grassroots non-partisan organization that brings faith, labor, and community groups to work towards a more just world.

1624
02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:58.500
I'm here to share my personal story and I'm also here to oppose HB 587.

1625
02:54:58.500 --> 02:55:10.500
As a law-abiding immigrant with legal status to live and work here, I don't see why this bill would be necessary on any ground.

1626
02:55:10.500 --> 02:55:17.000
Over the past five years, the level of tension has heightened against immigrants.

1627
02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:21.000
We have seen an increase in anti-immigrant incidents.

1628
02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:24.500
We have seen increased bias and discrimination.

1629
02:55:24.500 --> 02:55:31.000
Does this body want to endorse that, promote that, or encourage that behavior?

1630
02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:46.000
HB 587 is nothing other than a tool to promote discrimination and unfair treatment of immigrants who may come into contact with law enforcement and other government individuals with authority.

1631
02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:50.500
This bill is deliberately trying to create the other.

1632
02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:56.500
As an as an immigrant myself, I already feel that every day.

1633
02:55:56.500 --> 02:56:04.000
So why let us why did this really make us pit against each other further.

1634
02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:07.000
I, for one, know my rights.

1635
02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:14.000
And I know that with my status, I don't qualify for any government benefits.

1636
02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:20.000
And I'm happy that I have to work and contribute to society.

1637
02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:35.000
I know that I'm not eligible for it, but that doesn't stop me from educating the community and telling people about the importance of voting and turning out eligible voters.

1638
02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:43.500
The immigrants I know and that I encounter in my work understand that they are entitled to.

1639
02:56:43.500 --> 02:56:57.500
If you are a permanent resident, for instance, or a green card holder, or you are a non-temporary resident on a visa, you know what you're entitled to.

1640
02:56:57.500 --> 02:57:00.500
You know that you cannot afford.

1641
02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:08.000
So we know that they look pretty well as immigrants and what's available to us.

1642
02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Dr.

1643
02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:19.500
King said, it's not so much what evil people do, but it's too often the silence of good people.

1644
02:57:19.500 --> 02:57:23.000
I want to draw a parallel here.

1645
02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:29.000
This policy would do no good but harm if we do nothing.

1646
02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:39.500
This is a moral moment, so I believe this body is full of good leaders who will do the right thing.

1647
02:57:39.500 --> 02:57:47.000
I'd like to believe that the people of New Hampshire don't want this law either.

1648
02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:55.500
I'm proud to say that I'm now a New Hampshire resident, and that's what matters for me.

1649
02:57:55.500 --> 02:58:07.500
So I want New Hampshire to be our coming state, so I want to urge committee members to vote in a city to legislate.

1650
02:58:07.500 --> 02:58:11.000
Thank you very much for your time.

1651
02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
Thank you very much.

1652
02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:17.000
I've seen no questions, so thank you again.

1653
02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
Have a good day.

1654
02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:32.000
Next up, Chair recognizes Grace Kendecki, representing American Friends Service Committee, opposed to the bill, only seeking two minutes, but in all fairness, you've got three.

1655
02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.500
Hello, can you hear me?

1656
02:58:34.500 --> 02:58:36.500
We can now.

1657
02:58:36.500 --> 02:58:38.500
Good morning.

1658
02:58:38.500 --> 02:58:40.500
Okay, good morning.

1659
02:58:40.500 --> 02:58:42.500
Thank you so much.

1660
02:58:42.500 --> 02:58:50.000
My hello and thank you to the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak.

1661
02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.500
My name is Grace Kendeke.

1662
02:58:52.500 --> 02:58:59.500
I'm the program coordinator with the American Friends Service Committee, an immigrant justice organization.

1663
02:58:59.500 --> 02:59:07.500
I grew up in New Hampshire after immigrating here at the age of two in 1989.

1664
02:59:07.500 --> 02:59:17.000
I have lived in Manchester for the majority of my life, and I am currently a legal permanent resident.

1665
02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:38.500
I am here in opposition to HB 587 because I believe that there is no good reason for this bill, which seeks to manufacture an issue around either voter or proving citizenship, but instead continues to perpetuate an othering of immigrant granted staters.

1666
02:59:38.500 --> 02:59:45.000
To be an immigrant is to be acutely aware of your immigration status.

1667
02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:56.000
The penalty for claiming citizenship when you are not a citizen is very steep, and there's no good reason to do so.

1668
02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:17.000
That this bill comes up as a matter of convenience will have very untoward and unintended consequences that will contribute to New Hampshire becoming an increasingly unwelcome place for the thousands of immigrant families, communities, and taxpayers of which I am one.

1669
03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:22.000
Driver's licenses are used to establish photo ID and residency.

1670
03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:30.000
When I came to the U.S., I traveled with an original copy of my birth certificate.

1671
03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:44.500
In my 33 years of life, my family has been able to keep my birth certificate in a safe and a convenient place to be pulled out when needed.

1672
03:00:44.500 --> 03:00:46.500
Immigration status changes.

1673
03:00:46.500 --> 03:00:48.500
It's fluid.

1674
03:00:48.500 --> 03:01:00.500
And since I've been legally eligible to drive, I myself have held three different immigration statuses based on where I was in my process.

1675
03:01:00.500 --> 03:01:11.500
I urge the committee to vote to inexpedient to legislate this bill because it does not do what it says it does.

1676
03:01:11.500 --> 03:01:22.500
It will instead make immigrants like myself continue to feel what we already feel acutely as others are unwelcome in the state.

1677
03:01:22.500 --> 03:01:24.500
Thank you.

1678
03:01:24.500 --> 03:01:28.000
And I'm happy to take any questions.

1679
03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
Thank you very much.

1680
03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.500
Any questions from the committee?

1681
03:01:32.500 --> 03:01:35.000
Seeing none, thank you again.

1682
03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
Have a good day.

1683
03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
Thank you.

1684
03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.500
Oh, I made a mistake.

1685
03:01:41.500 --> 03:01:43.500
I do apologize.

1686
03:01:43.500 --> 03:01:55.500
Representative Perez, if I had seen you there earlier, I would have called you earlier, because I'm sure you're very busy today as well.

1687
03:01:55.500 --> 03:01:57.500
I do apologize.

1688
03:01:57.500 --> 03:01:59.500
Representative Perez?

1689
03:01:59.500 --> 03:02:01.500
Representative Perez?

1690
03:02:01.500 --> 03:02:03.500
Thank you.

1691
03:02:03.500 --> 03:02:07.000
Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

1692
03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
I'm against this bill.

1693
03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:14.000
As an immigrant, this is an assault to our rights.

1694
03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:29.500
To be honest, I've been listening to the testimonies, and one thing that I can say, from my own experience, to register for the first time when I registered to vote.

1695
03:02:29.500 --> 03:02:35.500
I was sent home three times before I can register to vote.

1696
03:02:35.500 --> 03:02:41.000
I went to my own town hall with my driver's license.

1697
03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:45.000
I was asked if I was a U.S.

1698
03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:49.500
citizen and I said yes I am a U.S.

1699
03:02:49.500 --> 03:02:52.500
citizen but I wasn't born here.

1700
03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:57.500
They sent me back home to go get my citizenship.

1701
03:02:57.500 --> 03:03:01.500
I went back home brought my my citizenship.

1702
03:03:01.500 --> 03:03:04.500
That wasn't good enough for them.

1703
03:03:04.500 --> 03:03:08.000
I went back home, brought my U.S.

1704
03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
passport.

1705
03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:15.000
So not even I brought my driver's license, my U.S.

1706
03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:21.000
passport, and my citizenship in order for me to register to vote.

1707
03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:33.000
So when I heard people saying that this is going to help us to register to vote, it's an immigrant, this is an assault.

1708
03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:36.500
This is not going to fix anything.

1709
03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:43.500
This is going to help people to discriminate for people for the legal status.

1710
03:03:43.500 --> 03:03:48.000
I go to the pharmacy and pick up medicine.

1711
03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:53.000
I just put myself in the shoes of other immigrants.

1712
03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:58.000
I go to the pharmacy once or twice a week.

1713
03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000
Thank you.

1714
03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:04.500
I go to the pharmacy and pick up medicine.

1715
03:04:04.500 --> 03:04:09.500
I just put myself in the shoes of other immigrants.

1716
03:04:09.500 --> 03:04:14.500
I go to the pharmacy once or twice a week.

1717
03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:26.500
Do you imagine people going to the pharmacy to pick up the medicine and have that stand like saying, oh, you're not a U.S.

1718
03:04:26.500 --> 03:04:29.000
citizen, you are a resident?

1719
03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:41.000
That gives people the rights to discriminate against people because of the color or because of the accent, because of the way they look.

1720
03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:53.000
We don't need any more lots and new hunches to let people discriminate because of your skin color, because of the way you look.

1721
03:04:53.000 --> 03:05:01.500
I'll oppose this bill, and I will ask every single one of you to oppose this bill.

1722
03:05:01.500 --> 03:05:04.500
And thank you for your time.

1723
03:05:04.500 --> 03:05:06.500
Thank you, Representative.

1724
03:05:06.500 --> 03:05:09.000
Any questions from the committee?

1725
03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.500
Seeing none, thank you again.

1726
03:05:11.500 --> 03:05:20.000
Chair recognized Bruno Soares, member of the public, representing Catholic Charities New Hampshire, opposed to the bill.

1727
03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:23.500
See if we can bring him up.

1728
03:05:23.500 --> 03:05:25.500
Hello.

1729
03:05:25.500 --> 03:05:27.500
Good morning, sir.

1730
03:05:27.500 --> 03:05:29.500
Good morning, Mr.

1731
03:05:29.500 --> 03:05:31.500
Chair.

1732
03:05:31.500 --> 03:05:36.000
Good morning, all of the members of the committee.

1733
03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.500
My name is Bruno Sorris.

1734
03:05:38.500 --> 03:05:48.500
I'm an advocate at Catholic Church New Hampshire, and I'm here to oppose and urge you to oppose HB 587.

1735
03:05:48.500 --> 03:05:55.500
And the reason being is because this bill is nothing but for discriminatory purposes.

1736
03:05:55.500 --> 03:06:05.500
Representative Betty Gray claims that only citizens and lawful permanent residents can apply for a driver's license in the state.

1737
03:06:05.500 --> 03:06:14.500
But there are other categories of immigrants who are allowed to apply for driver's license in the state.

1738
03:06:14.500 --> 03:06:21.000
The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, is one of them.

1739
03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:24.500
TPS, Temporary Protective Status, is another one.

1740
03:06:24.500 --> 03:06:30.000
Pending Asylum applicants are also in other categories, among many others.

1741
03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:43.000
I also would like to point out and clarify one of the things that was said today, that the effect of driver's license for identification purposes.

1742
03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:56.500
Although we do use driver's license for identification purposes, the statute only permits the driver's license to tell the status that the person is eligible to drive.

1743
03:06:56.500 --> 03:07:15.500
So I would like to direct you to RSA 263 1C, which states that a driver's license issued by the state of New Hampshire is a written declaration to the holder of permission to operate a motor vehicle.

1744
03:07:15.500 --> 03:07:21.000
So that's the effect of a driver's license in the state.

1745
03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:27.500
And the biggest concern that Representative Betty Gay had was that voting fraud.

1746
03:07:27.500 --> 03:07:36.000
So I just would like to point out that she she's targeting the wrong class by simply.

1747
03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:41.000
Please, please don't assume what she's trying to do, sir.

1748
03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000
Okay.

1749
03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:47.500
So by providing in-laws citizenship status on the application.

1750
03:07:47.500 --> 03:07:58.000
But in the past, the people that actually have committed voting fraud in the state of New Hampshire, they were U.S.

1751
03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000
citizens.

1752
03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:05.000
So most recently, 2020, we had Charles Eugene Cordier Jr.

1753
03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000
of Madison, New Hampshire.

1754
03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:15.000
We had 2020, Mary Lunds, 57, of Washington, D.C., charged for double voting in New Hampshire.

1755
03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:22.000
2016, Vincent Marcelo, 65 of West Lebanon, charged with double voting in New Hampshire.

1756
03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:29.000
2016, John and Grace Fleming of Hampton, charged with double voting in New Hampshire.

1757
03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:39.500
So, unfortunately, you know, we are trying to target the wrong category of people who actually has never, there's no indication.

1758
03:08:39.500 --> 03:08:44.500
Sorry, I'm just trying to keep it fair for everybody.

1759
03:08:44.500 --> 03:08:46.500
Your time's run up.

1760
03:08:46.500 --> 03:08:52.500
If you can, I'll give you an opportunity for a closing statement.

1761
03:08:52.500 --> 03:08:54.500
Thank you.

1762
03:08:54.500 --> 03:09:07.500
Yeah, so the wrong category for people that actually has never, and there's no indication that has committed voting fraud in the state of New Hampshire.

1763
03:09:07.500 --> 03:09:09.500
So thank you.

1764
03:09:09.500 --> 03:09:11.500
Thank you, sir.

1765
03:09:11.500 --> 03:09:14.000
Any questions from the committee?

1766
03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:18.000
Seeing none, thank you again for your testimony.

1767
03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:26.000
Chair recognizes Louise Spencer, a member of the public representing herself, also opposed to the bill.

1768
03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:30.000
Let's see if we can find her here.

1769
03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:32.500
I do not see her.

1770
03:09:32.500 --> 03:09:38.000
If she could raise her hand if she's in the queue.

1771
03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:44.000
Louise Spencer is, I don't see her on the attendee list either.

1772
03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:48.500
I'll give her a last call when we're done.

1773
03:09:48.500 --> 03:09:50.500
Move on.

1774
03:09:50.500 --> 03:09:57.500
Chair recognizes Christine Wellington, member of the public representing herself, opposed to the bill.

1775
03:09:57.500 --> 03:10:02.500
Seeking five minutes, but I'm going to keep it fair.

1776
03:10:02.500 --> 03:10:04.500
Three, please.

1777
03:10:04.500 --> 03:10:06.500
Good morning.

1778
03:10:06.500 --> 03:10:08.500
Can everybody hear me?

1779
03:10:08.500 --> 03:10:10.500
Good morning.

1780
03:10:10.500 --> 03:10:12.500
We can now.

1781
03:10:12.500 --> 03:10:17.500
Good morning, Chair Walsh and members of the Transportation Committee.

1782
03:10:17.500 --> 03:10:19.500
I'm Christine Wellington.

1783
03:10:19.500 --> 03:10:24.500
I'm here also on behalf of the Immigrants Rights Network.

1784
03:10:24.500 --> 03:10:40.000
And this morning, I apologize, we should have sent it yesterday afternoon, but I did send a letter from the Immigrants Rights Network that outlines our opposition to this Bill 587.

1785
03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:46.000
And we're asking for the committee to vote an inexpedient to legislate.

1786
03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:54.500
Our primary concern is the topic of violation of constitutional protections that both citizens and non-citizens possess.

1787
03:10:54.500 --> 03:11:11.500
And my former colleague, Attorney Stephanie Bray from New Hampshire Legal Assistance, went over all of the reasons why we believe that this unintentional consequence of this bill would be to trigger constitutional concerns.

1788
03:11:11.500 --> 03:11:17.000
I would also want to point out that as as Ms.

1789
03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:41.500
Fresca from the ACLU did, that immigration status and citizenship status is a fluid position, so any marking on a state license, even if it was legal, which we say it would not be, would be only accurate on the day that that applicant checked off a particular box.

1790
03:11:41.500 --> 03:11:56.000
I also understand that Representative Gay's idea was that this would be more convenient for folks if there was a marking on the license as to eligibility to vote.

1791
03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:11.500
I did have the opportunity to speak with Sherry Farrell, who is the town clerk of Londonderry and also the president of the New Hampshire Association of City and Town Clerks.

1792
03:12:11.500 --> 03:12:21.500
She said that they do not use driver's licenses to prove that somebody is a citizen of the United States.

1793
03:12:21.500 --> 03:12:41.500
And she also said that she is not personally aware or has been made aware by members of the 234 cities and towns in New Hampshire of any concerns with immigrants voting or using driver's licenses to attempt to vote.

1794
03:12:41.500 --> 03:12:45.500
So she thought that this was a non-issue.

1795
03:12:45.500 --> 03:12:54.500
One of the other things this bill asks is for the DMV to collect information based on citizenship.

1796
03:12:54.500 --> 03:12:57.000
The DMV already does that.

1797
03:12:57.000 --> 03:13:08.000
I did attach to the letter we submitted a copy of the DMV application form for both driver's licenses and non-driver IDs.

1798
03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:12.500
And you'll see that it has a checkoff box.

1799
03:13:12.500 --> 03:13:25.500
The DMV also participates in the SAVE program, which is operated by the United States Citizen and Immigration Services, which can verify immigration status fairly instantaneously.

1800
03:13:25.500 --> 03:13:27.500
Ms.

1801
03:13:27.500 --> 03:13:33.000
Wellington, can I give you an opportunity for a closing statement?

1802
03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.000
Thank you, Chair.

1803
03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:52.500
I think I've covered, the only thing I would also wanna say is that the term legal residency does not cover all the classes of people that are eligible for driver's licenses in New Hampshire.

1804
03:13:52.500 --> 03:13:57.500
And I'd ask, again, ask the committee to vote ITL.

1805
03:13:57.500 --> 03:13:59.500
Thank you.

1806
03:13:59.500 --> 03:14:01.500
Thank you.

1807
03:14:01.500 --> 03:14:04.000
Any questions from the committee?

1808
03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:06.500
Seeing none, thank you again.

1809
03:14:06.500 --> 03:14:10.500
I'm seeing a couple of hands come up.

1810
03:14:10.500 --> 03:14:13.000
Chair recognizes Representative Elizabeth Toll.

1811
03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000
Good afternoon.

1812
03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:17.000
Can you hear me?

1813
03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.000
Yeah.

1814
03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000
Can you hear me?

1815
03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000
Yep.

1816
03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:29.000
My name is Amanda Elizabeth Toll, and I represent Keene at Large.

1817
03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000
I oppose HB 587.

1818
03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:42.500
This bill requires that driver's license and non-driver's identification cards indicate whether or not the holder is a citizen of the United States.

1819
03:14:42.500 --> 03:14:47.000
This bill may be coming before the Transportation Committee.

1820
03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:56.500
However, I, and I believe the majority of my constituents, know this bill really has racist and xenophobic implications.

1821
03:14:56.500 --> 03:15:08.000
It will surely result in an increase in Black and brown people being detained and possibly deported, and will disrupt our immigrant communities.

1822
03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:24.500
In 2017, New Hampshire resident Eliezer Lopez Aiella, a husband and father who had lived and worked in the United States for 25 years and had no criminal record, had a flat tire.

1823
03:15:24.500 --> 03:15:31.500
A simple flat tire led to being detained by ICE and threatened with deportation.

1824
03:15:31.500 --> 03:15:40.500
On Thanksgiving of 2017, hundreds of people from my city of Keene organized in opposition to his deportation.

1825
03:15:40.500 --> 03:15:51.000
My city has also had very large turnouts for the Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of George Floyd's murder.

1826
03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:59.500
My constituents have shown time and time again that they reject racism and xenophobia in all forms.

1827
03:15:59.500 --> 03:16:07.500
I am here today to represent the citizens of Keene in strong opposition to this bill.

1828
03:16:07.500 --> 03:16:10.500
I will not be taking questions.

1829
03:16:10.500 --> 03:16:12.500
Thank you.

1830
03:16:12.500 --> 03:16:14.500
Thank you very much.

1831
03:16:14.500 --> 03:16:16.500
Chair recognizes Representative Horrigan.

1832
03:16:16.500 --> 03:16:19.500
I've been added as a panelist.

1833
03:16:19.500 --> 03:16:21.500
Okay.

1834
03:16:21.500 --> 03:16:23.500
Yes.

1835
03:16:23.500 --> 03:16:34.000
So I'm representing Timothy who are going to represent Drafat County district six, which is the towns of Durham and Madbury.

1836
03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:42.500
And Durham, as a college town, has more non-citizens with various immigration statuses than other towns would.

1837
03:16:42.500 --> 03:17:05.000
And then some of them, and the fact that they're, and some of them probably do have New Hampshire driver's licenses because the driver's license, you know, it's a license to drive and it's also it's a state function, whereas immigration is a federal function.

1838
03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:07.000
So we don't necessarily.

1839
03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:23.000
So the fact that you're there and you have a motor and you tend to drive a motor vehicle is separate from whether how it is that you got their immigration status.

1840
03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:37.500
So that's, and my concern stems from a somewhat related another hot question issue, which is EBT cards, which I've been working on off and on for 10 years.

1841
03:17:37.500 --> 03:17:49.500
We've had incidents with people being sort of appointing themselves or deputy, you know, health and human services officials who just clerks and stuff.

1842
03:17:49.500 --> 03:19:34.500
And like you had started with an issue 10 years ago with a man who didn't have a better we call non-visible disability but still had disability benefits and she wouldn't let him use the car and tell him to get a job and stuff and this could happen with the driver's licenses uh driver's licenses too because you often have to present them for people who are not with the dV or not law enforcement and they could sort of appoint themselves junior ICE agents to start challenging people because they think the citizen status on the card is incorrect or that they shouldn't be there so it's best to just not have it on the driver's license and also since the driver's license is issued because you're a resident regardless of like why it is how it is you came to be living here what your citizen did as others have said immigration status is fluid it changes a lot for the person it's still the same person including in some cases uh people have driver's licenses actually get to take the pledge and get to have the honor of becoming u.s citizens but they may still have their own driver's license without the little marking on it.

1843
03:19:34.500 --> 03:19:45.000
So that would be especially humiliating for those people if somebody started challenging their citizenship for the right to be here.

1844
03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:48.500
So I think we should keep that.

1845
03:19:48.500 --> 03:20:04.000
I think we should just, you know, the driver's license is for the purpose of proving that you're licensed to drive, and then it's also secondarily used as a picture ID.

1846
03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:37.500
So it's not a guarantee guarantee of immigration status and there's other documents people use to prove what their citizenship is or what their immigration status is so i think uh i think this bill is it was unnecessary it causes it solves a non-existent problem and it will cause lots of problems so i recommend that you find it an expedient to legislate so a lot.

1847
03:20:37.500 --> 03:20:43.500
I hope I added something from what the other people have said.

1848
03:20:43.500 --> 03:20:45.500
Thank you.

1849
03:20:45.500 --> 03:20:47.500
Thank you, Representative.

1850
03:20:47.500 --> 03:20:50.000
Any questions from the committee?

1851
03:20:50.000 --> 03:20:52.000
Seeing none.

1852
03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:54.000
Thank you again, sir.

1853
03:20:54.000 --> 03:20:56.000
Thank you, Mr.

1854
03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:58.000
Chair.

1855
03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:00.000
Thanks.

1856
03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:02.500
I see one more hand.

1857
03:21:02.500 --> 03:21:26.000
Chair recognizes Kelly Briniac with the New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles, and we are neutral to this bill, but did want to point out the limited amount of real estate that the DMV currently has on all types of New Hampshire driver licenses and non-driver IDs.

1858
03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:38.000
I believe our director did send samples to the chair, and that's it for me today, but I am happy to answer any questions.

1859
03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:40.000
Thank you very much.

1860
03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:42.500
Any questions from the committee?

1861
03:21:42.500 --> 03:21:44.500
Representative O'Hara?

1862
03:21:44.500 --> 03:21:49.000
Yeah, this is speaking to Matt's point last night.

1863
03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:53.500
Can we get a sample of the bath also?

1864
03:21:53.500 --> 03:22:03.500
I believe the director did send that, but if you did not, we can certainly resend it to the chair.

1865
03:22:03.500 --> 03:22:05.500
Thank you.

1866
03:22:05.500 --> 03:22:07.500
That's it.

1867
03:22:07.500 --> 03:22:09.500
You're welcome.

1868
03:22:09.500 --> 03:22:13.500
I believe it was only for the front.

1869
03:22:13.500 --> 03:22:16.000
We'll take care of that.

1870
03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:18.000
Thank you.

1871
03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:20.000
Thank you.

1872
03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:24.500
Seeing no questions, thank you again for your testimony.

1873
03:22:24.500 --> 03:22:27.000
I see another hand raised.

1874
03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:29.000
Chair recognizes Ann Grossi.

1875
03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:34.500
Good morning, my name is Ann Grossi, Can you hear me?

1876
03:22:34.500 --> 03:22:36.500
You can.

1877
03:22:36.500 --> 03:22:38.500
Good afternoon.

1878
03:22:38.500 --> 03:22:40.500
Good afternoon.

1879
03:22:40.500 --> 03:22:42.500
Sorry.

1880
03:22:42.500 --> 03:23:00.000
You already received my written testimony, so I will not go into that, other than to say that I live in Bedford, New Hampshire, and my daughter-in-law is from Thailand and is now a U.S.

1881
03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:02.000
citizen.

1882
03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:16.000
I just want to reiterate what one of the speakers said is that when she went to obtain her license, she had a green card at the time.

1883
03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:22.500
So the DMV did collect that information and does already have that information.

1884
03:23:22.500 --> 03:23:25.500
And she is now a U.S.

1885
03:23:25.500 --> 03:23:27.500
citizen.

1886
03:23:27.500 --> 03:23:31.500
She obtained her citizenship in October of 2020.

1887
03:23:31.500 --> 03:23:39.000
And when she went to vote in Bedford, she could not just present her license.

1888
03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:43.000
She had to have her certificate of naturalization.

1889
03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:53.000
So this bill seems to assume that immigrants are going to go and try to vote with merely a license.

1890
03:23:53.000 --> 03:24:02.000
And to me, Bedford, I'm sure is like every other town, they will not merely take a license.

1891
03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:06.500
They have to have something that will prove citizenship.

1892
03:24:06.500 --> 03:24:18.500
She showed her certificate of naturalization with great deal of pride so that she knew that she was now a citizen and could vote.

1893
03:24:18.500 --> 03:24:31.000
And I hope that this bill is opposed and will not be voted in in any shape, me, or form because it merely stigmatizes immigrants.

1894
03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:33.000
Thank you.

1895
03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:35.000
Thank you very much.

1896
03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:37.500

Thank you.

1953
03:27:40.500 --> 03:27:43.000
Can you guys hear me?

1954
03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:45.000
Yeah.

1955
03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:47.000
Thank you.

1956
03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:49.000
Thanks.

1957
03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:51.000
All right.

1958
03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:59.000
I'm going to open the public hearing on House Bill 496 relative to license plate covers.

1959
03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:01.000
Representative Pearson.

1960
03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:03.000
There we go.

1961
03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:05.000
How about now?

1962
03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:08.000
Do we have a copy here?

1963
03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:10.000
Yep.

1964
03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:13.000
We can hear you now, sir.

1965
03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:15.000
Good afternoon, Representative.

1966
03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:18.000
Thank you very much, honorable colleagues.

1967
03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:22.000
I come before you with House Bill 496.

1968
03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:41.000
For those of you that were on transportation in the last session, this bill should look relatively familiar to you as we did some work to make some changes to the bill that was filed a year ago.

1969
03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:45.500
Basically the premise of this bill involves Thank you.

1970
03:28:45.500 --> 03:28:52.000
to make some changes to the bill that was filed a year ago.

1971
03:28:52.000 --> 03:29:11.500
Basically the premise of this bill involves the recent popularity, I guess you will, of license plate covers that are not just there for the purpose of protecting the license plate, but are there to obscure the license plate.

1972
03:29:11.500 --> 03:30:16.000
And this is really something that has kind of exploded around here in the past several years so the the purpose of house bill 496 is to add some clarity into a current section of law that already exists under 261 semi-colon 176 because it's already against the law to obscure in a way a license plate in the sense that under the statute it states that you cannot normally obscure or permit to be obscured the figures or letters on a plate the problem is is that in discussions with my friends in law enforcement they found that that was a little bit ambiguous in the sense that they were getting arguments on the side of the road from people saying, look, you can read this just fine.

1973
03:30:16.000 --> 03:30:23.500
And the reality is, is that the overwhelming majority of states have addressed this issue.

1974
03:30:23.500 --> 03:30:32.000
And I sent each of you an email with my testimony and presentation, along with some photographs.

1975
03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:39.500
And I think the photographs are really the kind of the key to all this.

1976
03:30:39.500 --> 03:30:58.500
When you take into account, especially in one photograph where the plate of the vehicle that's right next to you, you can't even read, but you can read the plate of the vehicle that's in front of it.

1977
03:30:58.500 --> 03:31:02.500
So that's really the, the gist of this.

1978
03:31:02.500 --> 03:31:10.000
The, you know, ultimately the point of a license plate is to identify a vehicle.

1979
03:31:10.000 --> 03:31:16.000
And when one obscures that, they're separating themselves from the intent here.

1980
03:31:16.000 --> 03:31:48.000
It was interesting in my research of all of this with what the various states allow and do not allow that Channel 4 in New York had actually done a bit of an expose on it in 2014 as a result of people running to the toll plazas and obscuring their license plates so that the toll readers would not be able to function.

1981
03:31:48.000 --> 03:31:55.500
So I'm not going to read you the whole list of what every state does.

1982
03:31:55.500 --> 03:32:10.500
It's in the email I sent you guys, but it really does show that the overwhelming majority of the states have some sort of prohibition on this in some manner.

1983
03:32:10.500 --> 03:32:20.500
And interestingly enough, I'll point out the state of Oklahoma, a state I lived in when I was in college.

1984
03:32:20.500 --> 03:32:31.500
They will actually pull a vehicle over that is from out of state that has a plate that is covered or obscured.

1985
03:32:31.500 --> 03:32:44.500
And they're the only one that I could find of the states within their statute that specifically said they would pull over vehicles from another state.

1986
03:32:44.500 --> 03:32:55.500
Typically we have, we just don't do that when it comes to some things that are permitted in one state versus another.

1987
03:32:55.500 --> 03:33:11.000
But Oklahoma actually found this to be such a problem that they were willing to put it into their statute that vehicles from out of state would be cited as well.

1988
03:33:11.000 --> 03:33:14.000
So that's the gist of this.

1989
03:33:14.000 --> 03:33:30.500
And, um, I hope you guys all have a chance to look over the email I sent out and, and the, um, the examples and the photographs as to really what's going on.

1990
03:33:30.500 --> 03:33:49.000
And I, and the other thing I ask is that in the next few days before, um, if there's time period between now and the exec session that you just, just pay attention just a little bit.

1991
03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:51.000
These things are everywhere.

1992
03:33:51.000 --> 03:33:53.000
And Thank you, sir.

1993
03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:55.000
Representative Talarski.

1994
03:33:55.000 --> 03:33:57.000
Thank you, Mr.

1995
03:33:57.000 --> 03:33:59.000
Chairman.

1996
03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:01.000
Thank you, Representative Pearson.

1997
03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:07.000
I don't know if you remember, but last term I was opposed.

1998
03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:18.500
I voted against your bill and I'm hoping you can convince me otherwise this time, because I appreciate what you're trying to do.

1999
03:34:18.500 --> 03:34:24.500
And I agree with you that obscuring the plates is a problem.

2000
03:34:24.500 --> 03:34:34.000
My issue with it was that the statute as it stands already states that you can't obscure your plate.

2001
03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:36.500
You can't knowingly obscure it.

2002
03:34:36.500 --> 03:34:57.500
So my question is, if you put any color plate, clear or tinted, cover, excuse me, any color cover, clear or tinted over your plate, which we all know will get covered in grime and potentially obscure the legibility of the plate.

2003
03:34:57.500 --> 03:35:04.000
Isn't any plate cover that's placed going to be knowingly possibly obscuring it?

2004
03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:07.000
Thank you for the question, Representative.

2005
03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:19.500
I mean, realistically, you know, in the inspection standard in the state, it mentions, you know, that license plates have to be legible and clean.

2006
03:35:19.500 --> 03:35:23.000
And that's something that is certainly true.

2007
03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:41.500
But there is a, I think, in the land of sand and salt, you know, we have folks that have, you know, we're one of the most popular vanity plate states in the United States per capita.

2008
03:35:41.500 --> 03:35:51.500
And, you know, we have folks that will put completely translucent protective covers on these plates and those don't obscure.

2009
03:35:51.500 --> 03:36:04.500
Now, certainly if they get dirty, they do, but that would hold true for a license plate even if it didn't have a cover on it.

2010
03:36:04.500 --> 03:36:06.500
Any other questions?

2011
03:36:06.500 --> 03:36:08.500
Actually, I do.

2012
03:36:08.500 --> 03:36:15.500
Okay, I have nobody else signed up to speak, so I'll ask a question.

2013
03:36:15.500 --> 03:36:29.000
I heard you say that this, I thought I heard you say, maybe you can correct me, that this is different than the bill from last year.

2014
03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:55.500
If so, if I heard that right, can you explain for that one more time for clarity and so what the outcome for everybody's memory with the bill last year sure thank you sir the the original language of 14-0 something or other it was last time involved a scale, if you will.

2015
03:36:55.500 --> 03:37:23.000
The original language requested that the covers be 100 clear or translucent i can't remember which which was used and there was a tremendous amount of discussion in reference to to that number being being such a definitive number of 100 so the committee asked that that be removed and an amendment was brought forward.

2016
03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:26.000
And so the language was changed.

2017
03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:30.000
And then the bill was passed through committee.

2018
03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:45.500
It made it through the house and it got caught in all the, as we're all aware, the magnificent disaster that the Senate brought forward at the end of last year.

2019
03:37:45.500 --> 03:38:02.000
So the committee, like I said, last session, was happy with the changes that were made, and this reflects the changes that were requested by transportation in the bill in the prior session.

2020
03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:04.000
Thank you.

2021
03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:07.000
Any further questions from the committee?

2022
03:38:07.000 --> 03:38:09.000
Representative Sykes?

2023
03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:11.000
Thank you, Mr.

2024
03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:13.000
Chairman.

2025
03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:16.000
Representative Pearson, how are you today?

2026
03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:18.000
I'm exhausted.

2027
03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:22.500
I had Zoom going in two hands yesterday, simultaneously.

2028
03:38:22.500 --> 03:38:25.000
Some days are like that.

2029
03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:27.000
Yes, they are.

2030
03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:43.500
Why wouldn't it be just clearer to say any person who applies or permits to be applied any covering to a license plate that obscures the plate shall be guilty of a violation.

2031
03:38:43.500 --> 03:38:45.500
Why?

2032
03:38:45.500 --> 03:38:51.500
How is it helpful just to call out colored, smoked, and tinted?

2033
03:38:51.500 --> 03:39:01.000
And then leaving open the question of, well, if it's something other than that, it's okay to do it.

2034
03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:09.000
The only thing I can think of that would be other than that would be translucent.

2035
03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:16.000
So, you know, this is, these people don't make these things in their garages.

2036
03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:21.500
These are things you would buy at an auto parts store.

2037
03:39:21.500 --> 03:39:42.500
And that's the variety of covers that you can, at this point in time, you can purchase tinted covers, you can purchase ones that change the color of your plate, and you can purchase ones that are like I said completely clear.

2038
03:39:42.500 --> 03:39:48.500
And that's so I pretty much covered the the spectrum with that.

2039
03:39:48.500 --> 03:39:56.500
I'm not aware of any other type of cover that doesn't fit that those three categories.

2040
03:39:56.500 --> 03:40:01.500
Okay thank you for thank you for taking the question.

2041
03:40:01.500 --> 03:40:03.500
Further questions?

2042
03:40:03.500 --> 03:40:06.000
Thank you very much, Representative.

2043
03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:15.000
Thank you guys and I wish you all to be on schedule as my committees have struggled tremendously.

2044
03:40:15.000 --> 03:40:17.000
We're close.

2045
03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:23.500
we're close okay representative o'Hara, for some reason I can't split my screen.

2046
03:40:23.500 --> 03:40:29.000
Do we have any hands up for people wishing to speak?

2047
03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:31.500
I do not see any.

2048
03:40:31.500 --> 03:40:33.500
Okay, thank you, sir.

2049
03:40:33.500 --> 03:40:35.500
What's that?

2050
03:40:35.500 --> 03:40:41.500
If there are no hands up, I have nobody else signed up.

2051
03:40:41.500 --> 03:40:44.500
Representative Terlorski just raised her hand.

2052
03:40:44.500 --> 03:40:46.500
I'm sorry.

2053
03:40:46.500 --> 03:40:48.500
Thank you.

2054
03:40:48.500 --> 03:40:50.500
Mr.

2055
03:40:50.500 --> 03:42:12.000
Chairman, is it possible that we could see if there's anyone in the room from the Department of Safety who could maybe clarify if they believe that this bill um makes it even clearer about the obscuring the license plate yeah well we can look and i'll certainly try to get my screen split but if it helps uh captain haynes from department of safety uh an office of highway safety did sign in in support of it they're just they didn't want to testify uh ben hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, Elizabeth Sargent, also signed in in support of it they're just they didn't want to testify uh the new hampshire association of chiefs of police elizabeth sergeant also signed in in support did not want to testify uh and our friend eric rathbun uh once again has signed in in support but we can certainly see if she's on the line sergeant kelby miss sergeant kelby has his hand up.

2056
03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:14.000
Okay, great.

2057
03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:16.000
Sergeant.

2058
03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:18.000
Hello?

2059
03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:20.000
Hello.

2060
03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:22.000
Sorry about that.

2061
03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:27.500
I just, my computer just seems to have turned off there.

2062
03:42:27.500 --> 03:42:29.500
I apologize.

2063
03:42:29.500 --> 03:42:35.000
Representative Flursky, I raised my hand when you asked about that.

2064
03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:37.000
I apologize.

2065
03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:39.000
Mr.

2066
03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:43.500
Chairman, may I rephrase my question to, um, Sergeant?

2067
03:42:43.500 --> 03:42:45.500
Thank you.

2068
03:42:45.500 --> 03:42:47.500
Sergeant Kelp?

2069
03:42:47.500 --> 03:42:49.500
Yes, ma'am.

2070
03:42:49.500 --> 03:43:08.000
Um, I'm just wondering if you feel this bill, um, specifying the coloring of the, of the plate cover helps clarify what's already in statute, um, or if you feel it muddies the water a little bit.

2071
03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:10.000
Thank you.

2072
03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:21.000
the of the plate cover helps clarify what's already in statute or if you feel it muddies the water a little bit.

2073
03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:33.500
So in looking at 261-176 and the change in the in the verbiage you know as paragraph two I think it does clear it up.

2074
03:43:33.500 --> 03:44:07.500
Paragraph one does say, bear with me as I read this from my iPad, knowingly or deliberately fails to display on a via, I'm sorry, any person who knowingly attacks or permits to be attached to a vehicle number played assigned by the department or authority of any other jurisdiction to any, to another vehicle or who knowingly obscures or permits to be obscured the figures or letters.

2075
03:44:07.500 --> 03:44:10.000
I think that clarifies it.

2076
03:44:10.000 --> 03:44:17.000
The color part doesn't really concern me because the paragraph two does add it.

2077
03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:27.500
I guess this is just asking more for if you want to put a plate cover on it, is it permissible?

2078
03:44:27.500 --> 03:44:30.000
And this does clarify it.

2079
03:44:30.000 --> 03:44:44.000
I do recall last year this bill, and I do remember the discussion on opacity and, you know, as far as, you know, what light transmittance was required.

2080
03:44:44.000 --> 03:44:46.500
I think this clarifies it.

2081
03:44:46.500 --> 03:44:56.500
So I don't really have a concern with it because it does say, in essence, it has to be clear.

2082
03:44:56.500 --> 03:45:01.000
And paragraph one does say it cannot be obscured.

2083
03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:17.500
So road salt, which would have been my concern, debris like driving today to get yet another COVID test, you know, getting on the license plate cover would be covered under paragraph one.

2084
03:45:17.500 --> 03:45:21.500
That would be a violation of the law.

2085
03:45:21.500 --> 03:45:33.000
So I think this allows people to have their plate cover and it also, you know, clearly spells out what's permissible or not.

2086
03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:36.000
May I ask a follow-up, Mr.

2087
03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:38.000
Chair?

2088
03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:40.000
Follow-up.

2089
03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:42.000
Thank you.

2090
03:45:42.000 --> 03:45:44.000
Thank you, Sergeant Kelby.

2091
03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:46.000
That helps.

2092
03:45:46.000 --> 03:46:03.500
I am curious, do you pull over or are people spoken to, would you say equally for obscured license plates due to just grime right on the license plate or also grime on the cover?

2093
03:46:03.500 --> 03:46:11.500
Do you think it's a pretty equal regardless of if you have a cover or not?

2094
03:46:11.500 --> 03:46:13.500
I would think so.

2095
03:46:13.500 --> 03:46:20.000
I've stopped cars for having snow on their bumper covering the license plate.

2096
03:46:20.000 --> 03:46:24.500
I've stopped cars for having colored license plate covers.

2097
03:46:24.500 --> 03:46:34.500
And I have stopped cars for having the damaged clear damaged clear plates, because you just can't see the plate.

2098
03:46:34.500 --> 03:46:52.000
And even a comment to the representative that spoke earlier on the bill, the law permits, you know, police officers in the state of New Hampshire to stop any vehicle that has an obscured plate.

2099
03:46:52.000 --> 03:46:55.500
It doesn't matter what state they're from.

2100
03:46:55.500 --> 03:46:58.500
It specifically says or another jurisdiction.

2101
03:46:58.500 --> 03:47:09.000
So I think it's probably fair to say that any, you know, any obscurement would be, you know, reason to stop.

2102
03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:13.500
I think it would be equal across the board.

2103
03:47:13.500 --> 03:47:15.500
Thank you.

2104
03:47:15.500 --> 03:47:18.000
That helps me very much.

2105
03:47:18.000 --> 03:47:20.000
Okay.

2106
03:47:20.000 --> 03:47:22.000
Any other questions?

2107
03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:24.000
No, the committee.

2108
03:47:24.000 --> 03:47:26.000
Seeing none.

2109
03:47:26.000 --> 03:47:29.000
Thank you, Sergeant, for your help.

2110
03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:36.500
I was originally going to, well, first of all, nobody else signed up to speak.

2111
03:47:36.500 --> 03:47:39.500
No more hands raised, Representative O'Hara?

2112
03:47:39.500 --> 03:47:42.000
I do not see any.

2113
03:47:42.000 --> 03:47:44.000
Okay.

2114
03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:46.000
Thank you, sir.

2115
03:47:46.000 --> 03:47:54.500
And I've already read you the three people that have signed in in support of the bill.

2116
03:47:54.500 --> 03:48:01.000
With that, I'm going to close the public hearing on House Bill 496.

2117
03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:11.500
I was hoping to exec this today, but I've got a question raised now, too, that I want to look into.

2118
03:48:11.500 --> 03:48:22.000
We probably still barely have enough time, but I also don't want to get behind right off the gate this afternoon.

2119
03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:33.000
So I'm not going to, even though I was originally thinking of going to bring up the executive session on this today.

2120
03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:41.000
That being said, we'll be back at 1.30 for our next hearing on House Bill 175.

2121
03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:43.000
Thank you.

2122
03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:45.000
Thank you.

2123
03:48:45.000 --> 03:48:47.000
Thank you.

2124
03:48:47.000 --> 03:48:49.000
Thank you.

2125
03:48:49.000 --> 03:48:51.000
Thank you.

2126
03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:53.000
Thank you.

2127
03:48:53.000 --> 03:48:55.000
Thank you.

2128
03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:57.000
Thank you.

2129
03:48:57.000 --> 03:48:59.000
Thank you.

2130
03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:01.000
Thank you.

2131
03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:05.000
you I did that just getting back here.

2132
03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:07.000
Yeah.

2133
03:49:07.000 --> 03:49:09.000
Sound check.

2134
03:49:09.000 --> 03:49:12.000
Representative Hill, can you hear me?

2135
03:49:12.000 --> 03:49:14.000
I can indeed.

2136
03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:17.000
Thank Hill, can you hear me?

2137
03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:19.000
I can indeed.

2138
03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:21.000
Thank you, sir.

2139
03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:24.500
I can't hear Vice Chair Gagne, though.

2140
03:49:24.500 --> 03:49:26.500
How schnell!

2141
03:49:26.500 --> 03:49:28.500
Now I can.

2142
03:49:28.500 --> 03:49:30.500
Okay.

2143
03:49:30.500 --> 03:49:40.500
Alrighty, I'm going to open up the public hearing on house bill 175, an act relative to reciprocal driver education.

2144
03:49:40.500 --> 03:49:42.500
We have representative Comtois.

2145
03:49:42.500 --> 03:49:44.500
I just promoted her.

2146
03:49:44.500 --> 03:49:48.000
I don't know where she is now.

2147
03:49:48.000 --> 03:49:50.000
It was just there.

2148
03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:52.500
Hold on one second, please.

2149
03:49:52.500 --> 03:49:54.500
There she is.

2150
03:49:54.500 --> 03:49:56.500
Okay.

2151
03:49:56.500 --> 03:49:58.500
Hello.

2152
03:49:58.500 --> 03:50:01.000
Can you hear me now?

2153
03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:03.000
You can.

2154
03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:05.000
Good afternoon, representative.

2155
03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:07.000
Good afternoon.

2156
03:50:07.000 --> 03:50:09.000
Thank you, Mr.

2157
03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:15.000
Chair and members of the committee for hearing my testimony on this.

2158
03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:26.500
The constituent who is going to testify here today and the reason this bill was brought forward is ill and cannot be here.

2159
03:50:26.500 --> 03:50:35.000
So I'm going to basically run through why this bill came about and why it is needed.

2160
03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:39.500
A constituent contacted me back in April of 2020.

2161
03:50:39.500 --> 03:50:49.000
She had been trying to get her son a driver's license who had completed driver's ed in North Carolina.

2162
03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:54.000
He has a certificate of completion of the driver's ed.

2163
03:50:54.000 --> 03:51:01.000
And in October of 2019, she contacted the DMV and talked to the clerks.

2164
03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:07.500
And they told her to come on up to apply for his license.

2165
03:51:07.500 --> 03:51:22.000
In December of 2019, she went to the Tamworth DMV, and they told her that she was given misinformation because the North Carolina driver's education would not be accepted.

2166
03:51:22.000 --> 03:51:31.500
She then went and spoke to the supervisor of the driver's education, State Policewoman Stephanie Bosch on January 2nd.

2167
03:51:31.500 --> 03:51:33.500
She waited.

2168
03:51:33.500 --> 03:51:37.500
She followed up on January 14th with Ms.

2169
03:51:37.500 --> 03:51:42.000
Bosch, who said and then asked for her supervisor.

2170
03:51:42.000 --> 03:51:50.500
Long and short of it, until she got a hold of me, no one returned her calls.

2171
03:51:50.500 --> 03:51:57.500
The young man in question had completed his driver's ed training in North Carolina.

2172
03:51:57.500 --> 03:52:05.500
They moved here because they were in the military, so they had moved to New Hampshire.

2173
03:52:05.500 --> 03:52:23.000
If he was able to get his driver's license in North Carolina at the time, when they moved to New Hampshire, he could have just applied for a New Hampshire driver's license with no issues.

2174
03:52:23.000 --> 03:52:29.500
I contacted the DMV and spoke with Commissioner Balicki's assistant, the director's assistant.

2175
03:52:29.500 --> 03:52:32.500
And they got ahold of Ms.

2176
03:52:32.500 --> 03:52:36.000
Bodie, which she was very grateful for.

2177
03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:51.000
And the RSA, as currently written, says that they have the ability to waive the requirement and let the person go forth and take the New Hampshire driver's education test.

2178
03:52:51.000 --> 03:53:10.000
when I tell you that this woman for six months worked to try and get her son a driver's education tried to find out what she needed to do with no response until she contacted me in April.

2179
03:53:10.000 --> 03:53:24.500
And then her son did not get his driver's education license until July because the difference in the requirement between North Carolina and New Hampshire was four driving hours.

2180
03:53:24.500 --> 03:53:26.500
Four.

2181
03:53:26.500 --> 03:53:33.500
Now, he had been driving for over six months now, supervised with his parents.

2182
03:53:33.500 --> 03:53:52.000
I don't know how many other people that this is affecting, but because he moved to New Hampshire, he still had to take the New Hampshire driver's education test, which means he had to understand our laws.

2183
03:53:52.000 --> 03:53:57.500
He had to pass the driver's education driving part of it.

2184
03:53:57.500 --> 03:54:00.500
And they wouldn't wait four hours.

2185
03:54:00.500 --> 03:54:19.000
Now, if he was 16 and came here, you can take that and you don't have to know the New Hampshire driver's laws because you don't have to retake a test you just get a new license.

2186
03:54:19.000 --> 03:54:32.500
So I ask why we don't make driver's education reciprocal across state lines and I'd be more than happy to answer any questions from the committee members.

2187
03:54:32.500 --> 03:54:34.500
Questions from the committee?

2188
03:54:34.500 --> 03:54:38.000
Seeing none, thank you very much Representative.

2189
03:54:38.000 --> 03:54:40.000
Thank you.

2190
03:54:40.000 --> 03:54:42.000
Okay.

2191
03:54:42.000 --> 03:54:47.500
Chair recognizes Sharon Cameron, representing New Hampshire Driver Education Teachers Association.

2192
03:54:47.500 --> 03:54:50.000
We can find Sharon Camber.

2193
03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:52.000
Thank you, Mr.

2194
03:54:52.000 --> 03:54:55.000
Chairman and members of the committee.

2195
03:54:55.000 --> 03:55:00.500
The New Hampshire Drivers Education Teachers Association opposes House Bill 175.

2196
03:55:00.500 --> 03:55:15.000
The DMV already has a system in place to evaluate other states' programs and ensure public safety on our roads by insisting on standards equivalent to New Hampshire requirements.

2197
03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:26.500
What the DMV already does works very well and New Hampshire DITA doesn't support nor see a need for changes to the system.

2198
03:55:26.500 --> 03:55:35.500
I have in fact personally participated in helping families who move here finish their students' driver education requirements.

2199
03:55:35.500 --> 03:55:52.500
I can't speak to the student from North Carolina and the issues that they had with the DMV, but I've participated a lot in this program, and it's always worked very smoothly for us.

2200
03:55:52.500 --> 03:55:56.500
Thank you for the opportunity to speak today.

2201
03:55:56.500 --> 03:56:00.000
I'd be happy to answer any questions.

2202
03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:02.000
Thank you very much.

2203
03:56:02.000 --> 03:56:04.500
Seeing none, thank you again.

2204
03:56:04.500 --> 03:56:06.500
Thank you.

2205
03:56:06.500 --> 03:56:08.500
Mr.

2206
03:56:08.500 --> 03:56:12.000
Chair, Representative Gorski has his hand up.

2207
03:56:12.000 --> 03:56:14.000
Thank you.

2208
03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:16.000
Representative Gorski.

2209
03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:18.000
Thank you, Mr.

2210
03:56:18.000 --> 03:56:20.000
Chair.

2211
03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:23.500
I did have a question for Ms.

2212
03:56:23.500 --> 03:56:25.500
Cameron.

2213
03:56:25.500 --> 03:56:27.500
She's still on.

2214
03:56:27.500 --> 03:56:30.500
Let's see if she's still there.

2215
03:56:30.500 --> 03:56:32.500
I didn't see you.

2216
03:56:32.500 --> 03:56:34.500
I apologize.

2217
03:56:34.500 --> 03:56:36.500
Are you still there?

2218
03:56:36.500 --> 03:56:38.500
Yes.

2219
03:56:38.500 --> 03:56:40.500
Ms.

2220
03:56:40.500 --> 03:56:43.500
Cameron, thank you for your testimony.

2221
03:56:43.500 --> 03:56:46.500
Thank you for taking my question.

2222
03:56:46.500 --> 03:57:05.000
Can you describe briefly when there is someone coming from out of state, you know, a young teenager who, you know, has to go through this process, can you describe the process, kind of how it works?

2223
03:57:05.000 --> 03:57:07.000
Absolutely.

2224
03:57:07.000 --> 03:57:18.000
So I live on the border of New Hampshire and Vermont, and this kind of comes up a lot in our area.

2225
03:57:18.000 --> 03:57:22.500
I also live near Dartmouth College and the hospital.

2226
03:57:22.500 --> 03:57:29.000
So folks, families seem to come and go in this area fairly frequently.

2227
03:57:29.000 --> 03:57:45.000
So generally what happens is a parent will call me or the DMV and I direct them to the DMV to get approval for whatever their program is from their home state.

2228
03:57:45.000 --> 03:57:48.500
And they vary widely across the country.

2229
03:57:48.500 --> 03:57:57.500
And so once they get the approval from the DMV, then they just have to come to me.

2230
03:57:57.500 --> 03:58:09.500
They usually send me the email that says what the requirements are, four hours of driving, six hours of observation, almost never classroom time.

2231
03:58:09.500 --> 03:58:26.000
I think the DMV requires the 30 hours of classroom time regardless of the state and I expected perhaps that Director Bilecki would be here today and be able to speak to that.

2232
03:58:26.000 --> 03:58:50.000
But then all I have to do is finish up the hours with the student following the same rules that we follow for all the other New Hampshire students and then issue them a green certificate so that they can go to the DMV and get their license.

2233
03:58:50.000 --> 03:58:52.000
Thank you.

2234
03:58:52.000 --> 03:58:54.000
Questions?

2235
03:58:54.000 --> 03:58:56.500
Seeing none, thank you again.

2236
03:58:56.500 --> 03:59:01.500
That's all I've got for people signed up to speak.

2237
03:59:01.500 --> 03:59:09.500
Representative O'Hare, if you can look at some raised hands, if anybody else wishes to speak.

2238
03:59:09.500 --> 03:59:17.500
Is there anybody here from the Department of Motor Vehicles that would like to chime in?

2239
03:59:17.500 --> 03:59:20.500
Richard Dupont has his hand up.

2240
03:59:20.500 --> 03:59:22.500
Okay.

2241
03:59:22.500 --> 03:59:24.500
Thank you very much.

2242
03:59:24.500 --> 03:59:26.500
Well, that was interesting.

2243
03:59:26.500 --> 03:59:38.000
My name is Trooper Richard DuPont, and I represent the New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles and the New Hampshire Department of Safety.

2244
03:59:38.000 --> 03:59:52.500
I am the supervisor of the driver education program for the state of New Hampshire, and thank you for the opportunity to allow me to speak with you today.

2245
03:59:52.500 --> 04:00:06.000
I speak in opposition to House Bill 175 as it speaks to RSA 26320 in the general acceptance of any driver education program developed by another state.

2246
04:00:06.000 --> 04:00:24.500
As in New Hampshire, each individual state has developed a driver education program which centers around what that particular state legislature deemed important for the safety of their young drivers and for those traveling upon their roadways.

2247
04:00:24.500 --> 04:00:28.000
Each state has their own unique geography.

2248
04:00:28.000 --> 04:00:37.000
I think we can all agree weather conditions and so on that require different lessons to be taught.

2249
04:00:37.000 --> 04:00:41.500
So each program is different for state to state.

2250
04:00:41.500 --> 04:01:00.500
In the past, the New Hampshire state legislature spoke to the quality of our state's program and what that program should look like and can be found in part in RSA 263 colon 19, which is driver's education.

2251
04:01:00.500 --> 04:01:09.000
The state legislature together with the New Hampshire Driver Education Association, which you just listened to Ms.

2252
04:01:09.000 --> 04:01:32.000
Cameron, the New Hampshire Department of Education and the New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles developed a quality program to have certified instructors and at certified schools teach our young drivers how to properly and safely operate a motor vehicle upon the roadways in New Hampshire.

2253
04:01:32.000 --> 04:01:36.000
This program has been successful for many years.

2254
04:01:36.000 --> 04:01:55.000
Part of the responsibility of our office is to review and process the request for the transfer of out-of-state driver education programs in keeping with RSA 263 colon 20, which of course is the subject of this hearing.

2255
04:01:55.000 --> 04:02:13.500
The process for these transfer requests is fairly straightforward, but is a task which our office takes seriously because of the safety of the drivers on our roadways is of the utmost importance, especially the young drivers.

2256
04:02:13.500 --> 04:02:23.000
It's been my experience as the supervisor of driver's education that not all driver education programs are the same.

2257
04:02:23.000 --> 04:02:48.500
And speaking with my counterparts and driving education instructors from other states, some require less class hours, less behind the wheel time, less driving at night, and less if any observation time, which is where a student driver observes and critiques another student driver as it is required in New Hampshire.

2258
04:02:48.500 --> 04:03:04.000
The classroom instruction from state to state in some states can be completed either in an actual classroom or reviewed or by viewing online videos or by a parent or guardian.

2259
04:03:04.000 --> 04:03:16.500
And their programs do not always contain mandated content, which the state of New Hampshire has deemed important as can be found in RSA 26319.

2260
04:03:16.500 --> 04:03:33.500
There is one state that actually doesn't even require a driver education program to obtain a license, which of course is a problem on different levels, but not really the subject of today's hearing.

2261
04:03:33.500 --> 04:03:51.500
The process currently in place because of RSA 26320 allows for the review of a young driver's out-of-state driver education program and that would be compared to the quality program for the state of New Hampshire.

2262
04:03:51.500 --> 04:04:00.000
I would like to apologize for this person that did have this issue and that's young driver.

2263
04:04:00.000 --> 04:04:09.500
That is not typically the way that it works in in our office, I can assure you of that.

2264
04:04:09.500 --> 04:04:14.000
The turnaround time can take up to two weeks.

2265
04:04:14.000 --> 04:04:20.000
But typically, not typically the way that it works in our office.

2266
04:04:20.000 --> 04:04:23.000
I can assure you of that.

2267
04:04:23.000 --> 04:04:37.500
The turnaround time can take up to two weeks, but typically it's much less than that, maybe about a week to turn around these types of out-of-state transfer requests.

2268
04:04:37.500 --> 04:04:46.000
I've handled probably five or six just last year from North Carolina, their program is slightly different.

2269
04:04:46.000 --> 04:04:53.000
To address the driving time discrepancy, the state of New Hampshire requires 10 hours.

2270
04:04:53.000 --> 04:04:55.000
Is that enough time?

2271
04:04:55.000 --> 04:05:00.500
I don't know, but our state legislature said that it is.

2272
04:05:00.500 --> 04:05:12.000
And to have it even less than that, now six hours, is not, you know, it's not in keeping with our driving program.

2273
04:05:12.000 --> 04:05:25.000
And it actually having those additional four hours ensures that these drivers, these young drivers are actually safe or safer, right, in theory, on our roadways.

2274
04:05:25.000 --> 04:05:36.500
We all read about it in the newspapers how young drivers are getting into accidents, and unfortunately, fatalities result from some of these.

2275
04:05:36.500 --> 04:05:48.000
And I think to have an out-of-state program be allowed just as a general rule, I don't think is a very good idea.

2276
04:05:48.000 --> 04:05:53.500
The language in RSA 26320, in closing, should not be changed.

2277
04:05:53.500 --> 04:06:11.500
To allow the general acceptance of another state's driver education program would not only create a double standard for our young drivers here in New Hampshire, because they're going to be held to a higher standard.

2278
04:06:11.500 --> 04:06:21.500
And this allowing out-of-state driver education drivers, it could potentially create unsafe roadways here in the state of New Hampshire.

2279
04:06:21.500 --> 04:06:28.500
With that, I want to say thank you, and I will take any questions.

2280
04:06:28.500 --> 04:06:31.000
Sir, question for Representative Hill.

2281
04:06:31.000 --> 04:06:33.000
Thank you, Mr.

2282
04:06:33.000 --> 04:06:37.000
Chairman, and thank you for taking my question.

2283
04:06:37.000 --> 04:06:46.500
I've wanted to ask this for a long time, and I'm going to take the opportunity if I could.

2284
04:06:46.500 --> 04:06:48.500
Sure.

2285
04:06:48.500 --> 04:07:01.500
Is there any distinction when you're transferring driver ed from one part of the country to another that takes into account driving on snow and ice.

2286
04:07:01.500 --> 04:07:20.500
I've often wondered why we don't do something for those, even New Hampshire drivers, young drivers that take their driver ed in July and August and we don't ever teach them or have them drive in snowy weather.

2287
04:07:20.500 --> 04:07:28.000
And I wondered if that would be something that would be useful in your eyes.

2288
04:07:28.000 --> 04:07:36.000
If you're asking for my opinion, then yes, I think that absolutely, this is New England.

2289
04:07:36.000 --> 04:07:38.500
We have very unique weather.

2290
04:07:38.500 --> 04:07:47.000
And I can tell you as a police officer, the first storm snow storm of every year.

2291
04:07:47.000 --> 04:07:49.500
That's the worst storm, typically.

2292
04:07:49.500 --> 04:07:54.000
And I think most police officers will agree more.

2293
04:07:54.000 --> 04:07:57.000
There's more vehicles off the road.

2294
04:07:57.000 --> 04:08:07.000
I mean, people forget how to drive in the winter months and they forget how to drive on the snow.

2295
04:08:07.000 --> 04:08:09.500
And it's kind of crazy.

2296
04:08:09.500 --> 04:08:33.000
And your first snow, first couple of snow storms are more, not accidents, but they're pulling people out of the ditch, out of a snow bank, because they forget that I can't do a hundred down the highway or, or in this case, right, the speed limit.

2297
04:08:33.000 --> 04:08:35.000
And they drive unsafely.

2298
04:08:35.000 --> 04:08:44.500
And so why we don't have that in our program and have it mandated, I can't answer to that.

2299
04:08:44.500 --> 04:08:47.000
I cannot speak to that.

2300
04:08:47.000 --> 04:09:07.500
I do know that if, in my opinion, that if you required student drivers to actually drive in the winter months, then that just extends the program in the amount of time that young drivers would actually be getting their license.

2301
04:09:07.500 --> 04:09:15.000
I don't have an answer for you, but I mean, is it a good idea?

2302
04:09:15.000 --> 04:09:21.000
Of course, more more driving experience is better, but thank you, sir.

2303
04:09:21.000 --> 04:09:37.500
Actually, we're getting a little off track here, but we have talked about that simulators that you can actually even teach people how to drive in the snow in the middle of July.

2304
04:09:37.500 --> 04:09:41.000
But that's a topic for another day.

2305
04:09:41.000 --> 04:09:45.000
Next hand up I saw was Representative Aaron.

2306
04:09:45.000 --> 04:09:47.000
Thank you, Mr.

2307
04:09:47.000 --> 04:09:49.500
Chair, and thank you, Mr.

2308
04:09:49.500 --> 04:09:52.000
DuPont, for your testimony today.

2309
04:09:52.000 --> 04:10:09.500
So I guess I'm a little puzzled with this requirement because, I mean, when people come here driving here from other states, we assume that they know what they're doing and they're behind the wheel.

2310
04:10:09.500 --> 04:10:14.500
There's no extra testing or extra documentation required or anything.

2311
04:10:14.500 --> 04:10:23.500
I guess I'm not sure why that would make a difference in terms of driver's ed between states.

2312
04:10:23.500 --> 04:10:29.500
You know, it seems to me programs are pretty much the same.

2313
04:10:29.500 --> 04:10:31.500
Is that not true?

2314
04:10:31.500 --> 04:10:33.500
Or is that false?

2315
04:10:33.500 --> 04:10:43.500
Well, with all due respect, ma'am, I did list some things that are different, and it has been my experience.

2316
04:10:43.500 --> 04:10:54.500
I did speak to the fact that each state has their own unique program, and they're not all, in fact, the same.

2317
04:10:54.500 --> 04:11:03.000
And as I said, Alaska doesn't even require a driver's ed program, but that's a different subject.

2318
04:11:03.000 --> 04:11:07.000
I mean, that leads to a different area.

2319
04:11:07.000 --> 04:11:09.500
So every state is different.

2320
04:11:09.500 --> 04:11:23.500
And if you're looking at the difference between, I'm presuming a licensed driver versus an unlicensed driver, then I think that in my opinion, there's a huge difference.

2321
04:11:23.500 --> 04:11:47.000
There can be a huge difference because now it's an inexperienced driver versus a person that already has a license and has some legitimate life experience on the roadway versus a student that a young driver that has no license doesn't have a lot of driving experience.

2322
04:11:47.000 --> 04:11:52.500
Maybe they do with a parent, but not on their own.

2323
04:11:52.500 --> 04:11:59.000
And that license actually gives them the opportunity to drive on their own.

2324
04:11:59.000 --> 04:12:07.500
So there is a difference in the two types of a licensed driver versus an unlicensed driver.

2325
04:12:07.500 --> 04:12:10.500
Hopefully that answered your question, ma'am.

2326
04:12:10.500 --> 04:12:12.500
Somewhat.

2327
04:12:12.500 --> 04:12:14.500
Thank you.

2328
04:12:14.500 --> 04:12:16.500
You're welcome.

2329
04:12:16.500 --> 04:12:18.500
Next up, Representative Talersky.

2330
04:12:18.500 --> 04:12:20.500
Thank you, Mr.

2331
04:12:20.500 --> 04:12:22.500
Chairman.

2332
04:12:22.500 --> 04:12:25.500
Thank you for taking my question.

2333
04:12:25.500 --> 04:12:38.000
This seems like a very limited situation where you would have a teen take driver's ed in a state, then relocate before getting their license.

2334
04:12:38.000 --> 04:12:45.500
Can you tell me about how many transfer requests your office sees in a year?

2335
04:12:45.500 --> 04:12:49.500
Ma'am, I do not have an exact number.

2336
04:12:49.500 --> 04:13:01.500
I wasn't anticipating that question, but I would say that last year, our office handled between 20 and 30 out of state transfer requests.

2337
04:13:01.500 --> 04:13:08.500
I have actually eight sitting in my laptop here waiting for some final documentation.

2338
04:13:08.500 --> 04:13:24.000
and you know um typical part of this process um is is to just verify that, for one thing, that certificate from the other school is actually even a valid certificate.

2339
04:13:24.000 --> 04:13:28.000
And I guess the process is fairly easy.

2340
04:13:28.000 --> 04:13:39.500
But, again, all states are different, and we handle about 30 of these transfers a year, or at least we did last year.

2341
04:13:39.500 --> 04:13:41.500
Thank you very much.

2342
04:13:41.500 --> 04:13:43.500
Okay, thank you.

2343
04:13:43.500 --> 04:13:45.500
Representative O'Hara.

2344
04:13:45.500 --> 04:13:47.500
Thank you, Mr.

2345
04:13:47.500 --> 04:13:49.500
Chair, Thank you, Mr.

2346
04:13:49.500 --> 04:13:52.000
Dupont for taking my question.

2347
04:13:52.000 --> 04:13:55.000
I just had one quick question.

2348
04:13:55.000 --> 04:14:03.500
If a child is 16 in Florida, they get their license and then immediately move up here.

2349
04:14:03.500 --> 04:14:06.500
Is there any requirements for them?

2350
04:14:06.500 --> 04:14:13.000
They need to provide that they have actually taken a driver's education program.

2351
04:14:13.000 --> 04:14:15.000
That is...

2352
04:14:15.000 --> 04:14:17.000
Sorry, man.

2353
04:14:17.000 --> 04:14:20.000
Can I follow up real quick?

2354
04:14:20.000 --> 04:14:22.000
Yes.

2355
04:14:22.000 --> 04:14:24.000
No, go ahead.

2356
04:14:24.000 --> 04:14:26.000
Yes, thank you.

2357
04:14:26.000 --> 04:14:33.500
So they, but they wouldn't be withheld, like their license wouldn't be withheld from them.

2358
04:14:33.500 --> 04:14:46.500
They would just have to prove that they took driver's ed down in Florida and then they would get a license up here in New Hampshire.

2359
04:14:46.500 --> 04:14:50.000
Sir, different states have different graduated licenses.

2360
04:14:50.000 --> 04:14:54.500
So it would depend on the type of license.

2361
04:14:54.500 --> 04:15:11.500
Typically, it doesn't have any other stipulations attached to it, but some licenses are a graduated license where they can only drive during certain hours and I've handled a few of those as well.

2362
04:15:11.500 --> 04:15:54.000
Fortunately for those people that were making the request it was a it was an actual easy swap one for one because of the type of license that they had but but when those requests come in you really need to, and I think the DMV does a good job at this, is to make sure that the restrictions on those licenses, because the youth licenses typically have some sort of restrictions, that they're similar to our license here in the state of New Hampshire.

2363
04:15:54.000 --> 04:15:57.000
Did that answer your question, sir?

2364
04:15:57.000 --> 04:15:59.000
Yeah, it did.

2365
04:15:59.000 --> 04:16:01.000
Yep, you're welcome.

2366
04:16:01.000 --> 04:16:03.000
Thanks.

2367
04:16:03.000 --> 04:16:05.000
Thank you.

2368
04:16:05.000 --> 04:16:08.000
Did that answer your question, sir?

2369
04:16:08.000 --> 04:16:10.000
Yeah, it did.

2370
04:16:10.000 --> 04:16:12.000
You're welcome.

2371
04:16:12.000 --> 04:16:14.000
Thanks.

2372
04:16:14.000 --> 04:16:16.000
Thank you, Mr.

2373
04:16:16.000 --> 04:16:18.000
Chairman.

2374
04:16:18.000 --> 04:16:52.000
Trooper, isn't it true that the whole reason for driver's education and the reciprocity questions that have come up is that we are trying to protect the most valuable one of the most valuable resources we have in the state which is the the youth of this state and that they as a class typically have a somewhat higher percentage of motor vehicle incidents based on their inexperience.

2375
04:16:52.000 --> 04:16:55.000
I would agree with that, sir.

2376
04:16:55.000 --> 04:16:57.000
Okay, thank you.

2377
04:16:57.000 --> 04:16:59.000
Representative Everett.

2378
04:16:59.000 --> 04:17:01.000
Thank you, Mr.

2379
04:17:01.000 --> 04:17:04.000
Chair, and thank you again, Mr.

2380
04:17:04.000 --> 04:17:06.000
DuPont.

2381
04:17:06.000 --> 04:17:24.500
So in thinking about the state discrepancies and training that you described, how hard is it or would it be for someone to find an instructor here to provide the instruction for the areas that were lacking?

2382
04:17:24.500 --> 04:17:36.500
So in the example of Representative Pantois' presentation, she was saying that the person in question had four hours of training to make up.

2383
04:17:36.500 --> 04:17:44.000
How difficult would it be to find an instructor to just teach those four hours?

2384
04:17:44.000 --> 04:17:47.000
Ma'am, typically it's not that hard.

2385
04:17:47.000 --> 04:18:07.000
There are a lot of schools out there that are, they're busy, but I haven't found, in my experience, any student that really couldn't find a school to, that would provide that period of instruction for them, that drive time.

2386
04:18:07.000 --> 04:18:13.500
If I'm reading the timeline right, this occurred sometime in April of 2020.

2387
04:18:13.500 --> 04:18:21.000
And wouldn't that have been around the, you know, the onset of the COVID-19 virus?

2388
04:18:21.000 --> 04:18:51.500
If that's the case, around that timeframe, there were some schools that, you know, because the guidelines were, or we'll just say because of the COVID-19, some schools decided not to continue teaching driver's education, even though the governor's office deemed that driver's education was an essential business in the state of New Hampshire, and they could continue to do classroom.

2389
04:18:51.500 --> 04:19:07.500
But it wasn't until July, June or July of 2020, that the state of New Hampshire was actually opened up and our schools were allowed to continue with behind the wheel driving.

2390
04:19:07.500 --> 04:19:16.500
so trying to find a driver education school at that time frame probably was a little bit difficult.

2391
04:19:16.500 --> 04:19:30.000
I don't know where they were geographically in the state of New Hampshire, but typically in the state of New Hampshire, there are a number of schools.

2392
04:19:30.000 --> 04:19:36.500
We have about 75 driver education schools in the state of New Hampshire.

2393
04:19:36.500 --> 04:19:51.500
And to not be able to find one, especially at this time now, maybe back then it was a problem, but typically it is not a problem to find anybody.

2394
04:19:51.500 --> 04:19:54.500
Thank you so much for that.

2395
04:19:54.500 --> 04:19:56.500
You're welcome, ma'am.

2396
04:19:56.500 --> 04:20:03.000
I see before you go, Representative Hill, we've been beating up on Mr.

2397
04:20:03.000 --> 04:20:05.000
DuPont pretty good.

2398
04:20:05.000 --> 04:20:15.000
And while we've been doing it, I see three other hands raised, two of them from the Department of Safety.

2399
04:20:15.000 --> 04:20:25.500
I don't know if you want to ask him specifically or do you think you might get it from somebody else?

2400
04:20:25.500 --> 04:20:29.000
I'll hold on for the next person.

2401
04:20:29.000 --> 04:20:31.000
Thank you, sir.

2402
04:20:31.000 --> 04:20:33.000
And I think Mr.

2403
04:20:33.000 --> 04:20:35.000
DuPont thinks you're listening.

2404
04:20:35.000 --> 04:20:39.500
Like I said, if we're good, we'll move on.

2405
04:20:39.500 --> 04:20:41.500
Hold on, hold on.

2406
04:20:41.500 --> 04:20:49.000
Tupont, do you have any written testimony that you could send me in the committee?

2407
04:20:49.000 --> 04:20:51.500
Could you repeat that, please?

2408
04:20:51.500 --> 04:20:58.000
Do you have any written testimony that you could send to the committee?

2409
04:20:58.000 --> 04:21:00.000
I believe I can.

2410
04:21:00.000 --> 04:21:07.000
What I, my initial openings I do have typed down, but yes, I can.

2411
04:21:07.000 --> 04:21:10.500
That's the part that would be great.

2412
04:21:10.500 --> 04:21:12.500
Thank you.

2413
04:21:12.500 --> 04:21:14.500
Okay.

2414
04:21:14.500 --> 04:21:16.500
Yes, ma'am.

2415
04:21:16.500 --> 04:21:18.500
Captain Haynes.

2416
04:21:18.500 --> 04:21:20.500
Thank you.

2417
04:21:20.500 --> 04:21:32.000
sir um captain haynes um how about now is that better we can hear you now captain i'm sorry mr chairman mr chairman.

2418
04:21:32.000 --> 04:21:34.000
Chairman.

2419
04:21:34.000 --> 04:21:36.000
Mr.

2420
04:21:36.000 --> 04:21:44.500
Chairman, members of the committee, Captain Bill Haynes with the Office of Highway Safety, Department of Safety.

2421
04:21:44.500 --> 04:21:52.000
And I just wanted to share something with you to help in your decision process.

2422
04:21:52.000 --> 04:22:03.000
As you heard last year, there was a planned driver education assessment that was planned both last year and the year before.

2423
04:22:03.000 --> 04:22:07.500
And due to COVID last year, it was canceled.

2424
04:22:07.500 --> 04:22:32.500
I would submit to you that what that driver education assessment does through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, this takes a hard look at the curriculum of a program, and some of the things they talk about is one is program administration, the other is the education and training.

2425
04:22:32.500 --> 04:22:42.500
They talk a little bit about instructor qualifications, parental involvement, and then obviously how well everybody coordinates with the DMV.

2426
04:22:42.500 --> 04:22:52.500
So I would suggest before any laws were changed that perhaps you give that assessment an opportunity to go through.

2427
04:22:52.500 --> 04:23:06.500
And I do know that Director Balicki has applied for and been awarded a grant out of the Office of Highway Safety to conduct that assessment this year.

2428
04:23:06.500 --> 04:23:11.500
So I know that'll be bringing some pretty interesting information.

2429
04:23:11.500 --> 04:23:27.000
We might ask that they entertain an opportunity to look at our current program as to how we accept or don't accept out-of-state driving credentials for our youth and teen operators.

2430
04:23:27.000 --> 04:23:32.500
NHTSA does have a standardized recommendation for programs across the country.

2431
04:23:32.500 --> 04:23:37.500
And as Trooper DuPont said, they are vastly different everywhere.

2432
04:23:37.500 --> 04:23:41.000
However, there is a foundation for that.

2433
04:23:41.000 --> 04:23:49.000
And that's what they'll be looking at when they come to the state of New Hampshire.

2434
04:23:49.000 --> 04:24:05.000
And they will provide recommendations based on what they see, because many of us know one of the challenges we face is, are we going to go online with some of this?

2435
04:24:05.000 --> 04:24:16.000
So that's one of the reasons that I think we should wait and maybe entertain that as one collective group of information.

2436
04:24:16.000 --> 04:24:27.500
And the last thing I would offer is, from an Office of Highway Safety perspective, we're proponents of strengthening our graduated driver license.

2437
04:24:27.500 --> 04:24:53.000
But one thing we have to keep in mind is, in the instance of a person coming from another state who may or may not already have a driver license, it is our opportunity to make sure that our most trusted and valuable asset is protected and receives the proper training.

2438
04:24:53.000 --> 04:25:00.000
Unfortunately, once they've been licensed in another state, we do not have that opportunity.

2439
04:25:00.000 --> 04:25:08.000
And all we have is the choice of whether or not they've ever attended driver education.

2440
04:25:08.000 --> 04:25:17.000
So I think from my experience, I was a supervisor for licensing for many years prior to this.

2441
04:25:17.000 --> 04:25:23.500
And I would say to you that they are far and few between.

2442
04:25:23.500 --> 04:25:31.000
And I think the DMV has done a judicial job of trying to entertain them.

2443
04:25:31.000 --> 04:25:38.000
But again, I just highly encourage you to see what that assessment turns up.

2444
04:25:38.000 --> 04:25:47.000
I think you'll find it is a valuable tool for anything related to teen driving in the future.

2445
04:25:47.000 --> 04:25:49.000
Thank you.

2446
04:25:49.000 --> 04:25:51.000
Take any questions, Captain?

2447
04:25:51.000 --> 04:25:53.000
Yes, sir.

2448
04:25:53.000 --> 04:25:55.000
I would.

2449
04:25:55.000 --> 04:25:57.000
Representative Hill.

2450
04:25:57.000 --> 04:26:03.000
Just going to wait until the Department of Safety, if that's possible.

2451
04:26:03.000 --> 04:26:05.000
Okay.

2452
04:26:05.000 --> 04:26:07.000
Or DMV.

2453
04:26:07.000 --> 04:26:09.000
Okay.

2454
04:26:09.000 --> 04:26:11.000
Fair enough.

2455
04:26:11.000 --> 04:26:13.000
Thank you, Captain.

2456
04:26:13.000 --> 04:26:15.000
Thank you.

2457
04:26:15.000 --> 04:26:24.000
And I apologize for jumping in at the end, but I'm hoping that I can answer some questions.

2458
04:26:24.000 --> 04:26:33.000
First of all, Trooper DuPont is fairly new to the position, and this was his first public hearing.

2459
04:26:33.000 --> 04:26:39.000
I think he did a phenomenal job answering all of your questions.

2460
04:26:39.000 --> 04:26:50.000
I do believe that hopefully the instance that the representative was speaking to was really an isolated instance that we have experienced.

2461
04:26:50.000 --> 04:26:57.000
Around that time, we did see some personnel changes within the driver education supervision.

2462
04:26:57.000 --> 04:27:04.000
So we had a little bit of a gap in staffing there as well.

2463
04:27:04.000 --> 04:27:14.000
But I do want to just point out a couple of things, and I promise I will be very brief.

2464
04:27:14.000 --> 04:27:33.500
I think the spirit of the law and the reciprocity is really to ensure that out-of-state drivers really meet the same standards as New Hampshire drivers and New Hampshire youth when it comes to driver education in the state.

2465
04:27:33.500 --> 04:27:52.000
Again, the legislature has spoken and determined that the driver education program that's contained in 263.19 is the standard that we want to follow for all of our youth drivers to ensure the safety on our roadways.

2466
04:27:52.000 --> 04:28:00.000
And the reciprocity really ensures that out-of-state drivers or out-of-state students really meet the same standard.

2467
04:28:00.000 --> 04:28:06.500
Truper DuPont and myself work really closely on all of our out-of-state transfers.

2468
04:28:06.500 --> 04:28:18.500
There's typically a move and so forth prior to the individual either completing or being able to get a license in the other state.

2469
04:28:18.500 --> 04:28:28.500
So we look at those very carefully to ensure that they meet New Hampshire standards and are in fact equivalent.

2470
04:28:28.500 --> 04:28:46.500
There are instances where they have to provide additional or complete additional either behind the wheel instruction or observation hours, very rarely classroom hours depending on the the content of the other out of state program.

2471
04:28:46.500 --> 04:29:03.000
But we really take a very close look and we really believe that we have quality driver education in the state and ensure that those transferring out of state also meet those requirements.

2472
04:29:03.000 --> 04:29:07.500
And with that, I thank you for your time.

2473
04:29:07.500 --> 04:29:12.000
Happy to answer any questions that you might have.

2474
04:29:12.000 --> 04:29:14.000
Thank you, Director.

2475
04:29:14.000 --> 04:29:16.000
Representative Hill.

2476
04:29:16.000 --> 04:29:19.500
Thank you, Chairman, and thank you, Director.

2477
04:29:19.500 --> 04:29:50.000
It would seem to me that there should be just a page on our website that indicates to a young person that may come to New Hampshire under these circumstances that would just indicate if you've lived in Ohio and you've taken driver ed, this is what you need to do here when you arrive in order to satisfy our requirements.

2478
04:29:50.000 --> 04:29:54.500
Is that not possible or does that already exist?

2479
04:29:54.500 --> 04:29:58.000
Thank you for the question, representative here.

2480
04:29:58.000 --> 04:30:00.000
That does exist.

2481
04:30:00.000 --> 04:30:07.000
I'd be happy to send you a link to that page on our website.

2482
04:30:07.000 --> 04:30:09.000
Thank you.

2483
04:30:09.000 --> 04:30:11.000
Follow up quickly.

2484
04:30:11.000 --> 04:30:13.000
Follow up.

2485
04:30:13.000 --> 04:30:20.500
So wouldn't that have solved the representative, the case that brought this bill to us?

2486
04:30:20.500 --> 04:30:27.000
It seemed that the person just couldn't get answers for weeks, I guess.

2487
04:30:27.000 --> 04:30:41.000
And it would seem that if they had the ability or just pointed to a link on the website, that it would show what requirements that person needed.

2488
04:30:41.000 --> 04:30:43.000
Is that not true?

2489
04:30:43.000 --> 04:30:57.000
Potentially it is, but I can tell you that yourself, myself, we're very familiar with New Hampshire laws, how to interpret them, how to read them as well.

2490
04:30:57.000 --> 04:31:02.000
It's not necessarily the case for all of our applicants.

2491
04:31:02.000 --> 04:31:20.500
They might go and look at our requirements, but sometimes might kind of feel lost in those requirements and not sure and not necessarily be able to interpret them to see how they apply to their situation.

2492
04:31:20.500 --> 04:31:38.500
So definitely, I think, a good start, but we find that many of them would prefer to speak to someone in person to really get any answers or answers to any of their questions and clarifications.

2493
04:31:38.500 --> 04:31:40.500
Thank you, Director.

2494
04:31:40.500 --> 04:31:42.500
Thank you.

2495
04:31:42.500 --> 04:31:44.500
Further questions?

2496
04:31:44.500 --> 04:31:47.000
Seeing none, thank you, Director.

2497
04:31:47.000 --> 04:31:49.000
Lucky.

2498
04:31:49.000 --> 04:31:51.000
Thank you, Director.

2499
04:31:51.000 --> 04:31:53.000
Thank you.

2500
04:31:53.000 --> 04:31:55.000
Further questions?

2501
04:31:55.000 --> 04:31:57.500
Seeing none, thank you, Director.

2502
04:31:57.500 --> 04:31:59.500
Thank you.

2503
04:31:59.500 --> 04:32:01.500
Dan Bennett updated.

2504
04:32:01.500 --> 04:32:05.000
Did he want to speak to this?

2505
04:32:05.000 --> 04:32:09.000
No, I accidentally gave him permission to talk.

2506
04:32:09.000 --> 04:32:11.000
I didn't mean to.

2507
04:32:11.000 --> 04:32:13.000
Okay.

2508
04:32:13.000 --> 04:32:18.000
All right, that's all I have signed up to speak.

2509
04:32:18.000 --> 04:32:20.000
I see no erase.

2510
04:32:20.000 --> 04:32:24.500
I'm not sure if I can speak to this.

2511
04:32:24.500 --> 04:32:29.000
I'm not sure if I can speak to this.

2512
04:32:29.000 --> 04:32:33.500
I'm not sure if I can speak to this.

2513
04:32:33.500 --> 04:32:38.000
I'm not sure if I can speak to this.

2514
04:32:38.000 --> 04:32:42.500
I'm not sure if I can speak to this.

2515
04:32:42.500 --> 04:32:47.000
I'm not sure if I can speak to this.

2516
04:32:47.000 --> 04:32:51.500
I'm not sure if I can speak to this.

2517
04:32:51.500 --> 04:32:56.000
I'm not sure if I can speak to this.

2518
04:32:56.000 --> 04:32:59.000
I have signed up to speak.

2519
04:32:59.000 --> 04:33:29.500
I or no i accidentally gave him permission to talk i didn't mean to okay all right now that's all i have signed up to speak i see no more raised hands uh for the record we have one two three four five more four more members of the public in support and representative lynn uh also signed up in support.

2520
04:33:29.500 --> 04:33:36.000
With that, I'm going to close the public hearing on Coast Bill 175.

2521
04:33:36.000 --> 04:33:41.000
Give us just a couple of moments to reset, please.

2522
04:33:41.000 --> 04:33:47.500
All radio public hearing on House Bill 300, In relative to driver education.

2523
04:33:47.500 --> 04:33:49.500
Looking for Representative Lang.

2524
04:33:49.500 --> 04:33:53.000
I'll get an email a minute ago.

2525
04:33:53.000 --> 04:33:56.000
I think he's on his way.

2526
04:33:56.000 --> 04:33:58.500
I raised my hand, Mr.

2527
04:33:58.500 --> 04:34:00.500
Chairman.

2528
04:34:00.500 --> 04:34:02.500
I'm here.

2529
04:34:02.500 --> 04:34:04.500
Good afternoon, sir.

2530
04:34:04.500 --> 04:34:06.500
How are you?

2531
04:34:06.500 --> 04:34:08.500
Thank you very much.

2532
04:34:08.500 --> 04:34:10.500
Laura George.

2533
04:34:10.500 --> 04:34:12.500
Thank you, sir.

2534
04:34:12.500 --> 04:34:14.500
Appreciate it.

2535
04:34:14.500 --> 04:34:16.500
Thank you, committee members.

2536
04:34:16.500 --> 04:34:18.500
Thank you, Mr.

2537
04:34:18.500 --> 04:34:21.000
Chairman, for taking my testimony.

2538
04:34:21.000 --> 04:34:30.000
I give you House Bill 300 relative to driver's education, which seems to be a topic this afternoon.

2539
04:34:30.000 --> 04:34:33.500
This bill is a pretty straightforward bill.

2540
04:34:33.500 --> 04:34:36.000
It does basically one thing.

2541
04:34:36.000 --> 04:34:42.000
It allows parents the option of teaching their own children driver's education.

2542
04:34:42.000 --> 04:34:46.500
This is not an uncommon action in other states.

2543
04:34:46.500 --> 04:34:56.000
There are other states that allow parents to teach their children, both the classroom and behind the wheel training.

2544
04:34:56.000 --> 04:35:24.500
I would, as I listened to the other bill that was just heard, a bunch of things came to mind about the conversation around driver's education, how we've institutionalized it and made it so that, you know, we can't think of a time when we don't have it, which I think needs to be a changed mindset.

2545
04:35:24.500 --> 04:35:40.000
If COVID taught us anything, our mandates at the state level create significant impediment to our citizens in the state of New Hampshire, and driver's ed is no exception to that.

2546
04:35:40.000 --> 04:35:57.000
We saw that the governor had to issue executive order 18, which waived some of the requirements for driver's education, including six hours of observation time, and allowed parents to do that observation time.

2547
04:35:57.000 --> 04:36:29.000
We saw that the issue, I serve on the governor's reopening task force myself, and Bill Marsh wrote the guidance for the driver's education programs to reopen, and those guidances were issued in May and the governor immediately acted upon them and allowed for the terms and conditions that allowed the driver's education to operate in a safe and effective manner during this COVID.

2548
04:36:29.000 --> 04:36:32.000
But again, many parents were interrupted.

2549
04:36:32.000 --> 04:36:51.000
And I don't know how many phone calls I took on the task force relative to this driver's education mandate and the fact that they wanted to teach their own kid and let them go take the test.

2550
04:36:51.000 --> 04:36:58.500
And we were stuck with driver's schools, as you heard from the previous, were closed.

2551
04:36:58.500 --> 04:37:00.500
They were unavailable.

2552
04:37:00.500 --> 04:37:07.000
Some were, even though they were allowed to open, chose not to open.

2553
04:37:07.000 --> 04:37:50.500
And geographically, that could be an issue, especially when you look up north in in our northern community there's not very many driver's education opportunities up there I mean I was looking at one up in Lancaster and their next two classes are completely full so if you're a student who wants to get get your driver's license you have to wait till April or May now before you would get into a class to take your take your driver's education education and then do your work.

2554
04:37:50.500 --> 04:38:19.500
Just as a backup to remind people what are the requirements for driver's education is that under the instruction side for driver's education, you have to have 30 hours of classroom instruction from a certified driver's education instructor, 10 hours of practice time in driving, six hours of observation time of driving, and that's all with an instructor.

2555
04:38:19.500 --> 04:38:27.500
But there's 40 hours of practice time in driving, six hours of observation time of driving.

2556
04:38:27.500 --> 04:38:30.000
That's all with an instructor.

2557
04:38:30.000 --> 04:38:36.500
But there's 40 hours of additional driving that are done with the parents.

2558
04:38:36.500 --> 04:38:44.000
So over 80% or 80% of the driving is actually done with the parents already.

2559
04:38:44.000 --> 04:38:48.500
And I was, again, listening to that other conversation.

2560
04:38:48.500 --> 04:39:02.000
I found it kind of amusing considering when I was getting my driver's license, I was living in Alaska, and Alaska doesn't have a driving education requirement.

2561
04:39:02.000 --> 04:39:14.000
But the overriding factor I heard in that last conversation, we're talking about how this impacts New Hampshire citizens and the ability to go.

2562
04:39:14.000 --> 04:39:28.500
And we're talking about inexperienced drivers and how our youngest citizens who just get their licenses are the ones most apt to be in an accident or have issues.

2563
04:39:28.500 --> 04:39:39.000
We heard about issues and the troopers talking about driving on the first day of a snowstorm when winter rolls around.

2564
04:39:39.000 --> 04:39:42.000
And I was a police officer.

2565
04:39:42.000 --> 04:39:48.000
I spent years in uniform, over a decade in a police uniform.

2566
04:39:48.000 --> 04:39:53.000
And I can tell you, that's an absolute true statement.

2567
04:39:53.000 --> 04:40:03.500
We used to almost want to call in sick when we heard there was going to be a snowstorm coming up.

2568
04:40:03.500 --> 04:40:11.000
Because that first day of driving, every citizen's forgotten how to drive in the snow.

2569
04:40:11.000 --> 04:40:17.500
And you're doing nothing but pulling cars out of ditches all day long.

2570
04:40:17.500 --> 04:40:24.500
And just taking traffic accident reports, which is just, you know, not very fun.

2571
04:40:24.500 --> 04:40:26.500
So I get it.

2572
04:40:26.500 --> 04:40:31.000
But all those people have had driver's education, right.

2573
04:40:31.000 --> 04:40:37.000
So you're talking about the inexperienced drivers that are off the road.

2574
04:40:37.000 --> 04:40:39.000
They've already been through.

2575
04:40:39.000 --> 04:40:41.000
We have a mandate.

2576
04:40:41.000 --> 04:40:44.000
They've already been on the road.

2577
04:40:44.000 --> 04:40:51.000
So either our driver's education isn't functioning or it's not tied to safe driving.

2578
04:40:51.000 --> 04:40:54.500
There has to be a correlation there.

2579
04:40:54.500 --> 04:41:12.000
And apparently all the other conversation we just had was the fact that the driver's education, these people have already been, we have a mandate that's been around for over 20 years, if not longer.

2580
04:41:12.000 --> 04:41:25.000
And yet everybody under the age of 40 has been through and is still running off the road in the first day of a snow storm.

2581
04:41:25.000 --> 04:41:28.500
So I'm not sure there's correlation there.

2582
04:41:28.500 --> 04:41:41.500
But the last thing I'd say is that by removing the requirement of a driver's education does not mean you're putting unsafe drivers on the road.

2583
04:41:41.500 --> 04:41:46.500
We still have a check and balance system in place.

2584
04:41:46.500 --> 04:42:03.500
That check and balance is the Department of Motor Vehicle does a written exam to make sure they understand the basic rules of the road as it relates to the laws of New Hampshire.

2585
04:42:03.500 --> 04:42:10.500
And that they know what they're allowed to do and not allowed to do.

2586
04:42:10.500 --> 04:42:24.000
And then that's followed up by a practical exam by a highway safety officer who takes that new licensed driver and takes them out on the road.

2587
04:42:24.000 --> 04:42:32.500
I can't imagine either DMV or the highway safety officer allowing an unfit driver on the road.

2588
04:42:32.500 --> 04:42:42.000
Regardless of how they learn to become fit, they're not going to let that unfit driver on the road.

2589
04:42:42.000 --> 04:42:47.000
So there is a check and balance against this system.

2590
04:42:47.000 --> 04:42:57.500
And some people are concerned, do we take away driver's education, we're going to have just crazy drivers on the road.

2591
04:42:57.500 --> 04:43:01.500
But the reality is that that's not true.

2592
04:43:01.500 --> 04:43:13.000
Everybody takes the same exam, whether you've been to the driver's education program, or in my case, if your parents are teaching it.

2593
04:43:13.000 --> 04:43:21.500
I will tell you, I spoke to a high school, a couple of superintendents about this bill.

2594
04:43:21.500 --> 04:43:34.000
And the superintendents of the schools are telling me that this creates an imbalance in their school because you have some have and have nots.

2595
04:43:34.000 --> 04:43:45.000
I'm not sure if the committee is aware, but the cost of a driver's education program is 600 and sometimes over $700.

2596
04:43:45.000 --> 04:43:56.000
Again, some of the research I did, we have in the state driver's education programs that cost more than $750 to take.

2597
04:43:56.000 --> 04:43:58.000
And that's...

2598
04:43:58.000 --> 04:44:45.500
hundred and sometimes over seven hundred dollars again some of the research i did we have in the state um driver's education programs that cost more than 750 to take and that creates a huge impediment to lower income people or even even low to middle class income people um that that that huge burden to overcome to allow their their child to be able to get a driver's license so they can get a job and be productive and go to work is huge and only further creates a disparity between the income classes.

2599
04:44:45.500 --> 04:44:51.500
A person who's a high income at work doesn't care about $700.

2600
04:44:51.500 --> 04:44:57.500
They can pay the $750 for their child to go get it.

2601
04:44:57.500 --> 04:45:15.500
But a person who is struggling paycheck to paycheck and that cost of $700 additional cost that's mandated by the state for their 16-year- old to go get their driver's license can be a huge obstacle.

2602
04:45:15.500 --> 04:45:20.000
And there is no easy way out of it.

2603
04:45:20.000 --> 04:45:26.000
And so I think this is a socioeconomic problem in our society.

2604
04:45:26.000 --> 04:45:35.500
I think this creates a bigger gap in the have and have nots and creates problems in high schools.

2605
04:45:35.500 --> 04:45:55.000
I will tell you that the superintendents I spoke to said that if this bill passed, they would consider offering the book side of this class in their schools as an elective because they'd be allowed to do it.

2606
04:45:55.000 --> 04:46:00.000
It doesn't have to be a certified driver's education program.

2607
04:46:00.000 --> 04:46:19.000
They could offer the book learning piece, order the materials from the driver's book from the Department of Motor Vehicle and offer on a quarterly basis the book learning so the parents can focus on the practical learning.

2608
04:46:19.000 --> 04:46:26.500
But none of this can happen unless this bill passes and allows it to happen.

2609
04:46:26.500 --> 04:46:34.500
I'm happy to take questions from the committee, but again, I think this restores parental rights.

2610
04:46:34.500 --> 04:46:38.000
I learned to drive by my parents.

2611
04:46:38.000 --> 04:46:44.000
I imagine many committee members here learned to drive with their parents.

2612
04:46:44.000 --> 04:46:50.500
Some of us learned to drive on equipment that wasn't even a car.

2613
04:46:50.500 --> 04:46:55.500
It was a tractor or a piece of construction equipment.

2614
04:46:55.500 --> 04:47:02.500
So again, there are more ways to learn than just going to a classroom.

2615
04:47:02.500 --> 04:47:04.500
Thank you, Mr.

2616
04:47:04.500 --> 04:47:06.500
Chairman.

2617
04:47:06.500 --> 04:47:08.500
Thank you.

2618
04:47:08.500 --> 04:47:12.000
I see a couple of hands up.

2619
04:47:12.000 --> 04:47:14.000
Representative Hill.

2620
04:47:14.000 --> 04:47:16.000
Thank you, Mr.

2621
04:47:16.000 --> 04:47:18.000
Chairman.

2622
04:47:18.000 --> 04:47:22.500
And thank you, Representative, for bringing the bill forward.

2623
04:47:22.500 --> 04:47:40.000
Do you see a situation where a student may not be able to afford the driver ed cost and simply just waits until they turn 18 and takes the exam without ever having driver ed?

2624
04:47:40.000 --> 04:47:49.000
And wouldn't that be a detriment to society having never taken driver ed prior to taking the exam?

2625
04:47:49.000 --> 04:47:52.500
Thank you, Representative Hill for your question.

2626
04:47:52.500 --> 04:47:54.500
And that's exactly true.

2627
04:47:54.500 --> 04:48:03.500
Somehow there's a magical thing that happens when you're 17 years, 364 days, you can't have a license.

2628
04:48:03.500 --> 04:48:17.000
But that very next day, all of a sudden you can walk in, take the written exam, take the practical exam, and you can get a license.

2629
04:48:17.000 --> 04:48:20.000
I think that is a disservice.

2630
04:48:20.000 --> 04:48:27.000
I think that everybody can be served by allowing this bill to move forward.

2631
04:48:27.000 --> 04:48:29.000
Thank you.

2632
04:48:29.000 --> 04:48:31.000
Representative Thank you Mr.

2633
04:48:31.000 --> 04:48:33.000
Chairman.

2634
04:48:33.000 --> 04:48:35.000
Thank you.

2635
04:48:35.000 --> 04:48:37.000
Representative Gagnon.

2636
04:48:37.000 --> 04:48:39.000
Thank you, Mr.

2637
04:48:39.000 --> 04:48:41.000
Chairman.

2638
04:48:41.000 --> 04:48:44.500
Thank you, Representative Lange, for my question.

2639
04:48:44.500 --> 04:48:58.000
I really don't know if it's too late, but I'm looking at your analysis, and it's, you know, responsible adults, et cetera, provides instruction behind All right.

2640
04:48:58.000 --> 04:49:08.000
And you also said that the parents have to do 40 hours of extra driving to hold their children's skills.

2641
04:49:08.000 --> 04:49:20.000
Would proof needed or required to show that they had covered the prior requirements that a driver didn't spoke with would do for it.

2642
04:49:20.000 --> 04:49:22.000
I'm sorry, Mr.

2643
04:49:22.000 --> 04:49:25.000
Chairman, can you restate the question?

2644
04:49:25.000 --> 04:49:31.500
He's really, the representative was really muffled and I didn't follow the question.

2645
04:49:31.500 --> 04:49:36.500
Yeah, he's kind of a long ways away from you.

2646
04:49:36.500 --> 04:49:39.000
Hang on for a minute.

2647
04:49:39.000 --> 04:49:41.000
Try again, Larry.

2648
04:49:41.000 --> 04:49:44.000
I'm going to go over here.

2649
04:49:44.000 --> 04:49:47.000
Off camera, can you hear me?

2650
04:49:47.000 --> 04:49:50.500
I can hear you perfectly now, sir.

2651
04:49:50.500 --> 04:49:56.000
I'm next to a mic instead of being 15 feet away.

2652
04:49:56.000 --> 04:50:01.000
Thank you for taking my question again and your patience.

2653
04:50:01.000 --> 04:50:06.500
I'm looking at the analysis and I listened to your testimony.

2654
04:50:06.500 --> 04:50:10.000
The classroom instruction behind the wheel training.

2655
04:50:10.000 --> 04:50:18.000
I see that the parents also have to do 40 hours of driving with their children.

2656
04:50:18.000 --> 04:50:30.500
Would proof be required or needed to show that what they would probably learn in the driver's ed class that probably would not be covered?

2657
04:50:30.500 --> 04:50:38.000
Would the state need to have proof that that part of the instruction was covered?

2658
04:50:38.000 --> 04:50:41.500
So thank you, Representative, for that question.

2659
04:50:41.500 --> 04:51:48.000
And again, if you read the last line of the bill in Section 5, It says that the parent uh has has provided classroom instruction behind the wheel training as equivalent to the approved driver education course so again based on the the driver's education course is outlined in the department of safety um rules and regulations so you know what what sections and what components and how much time you have to spend on each topic and the parents would have to do that same same stuff just not at a driver's education school the parents would have to follow the same that same uh department of safety regulation please okay but would they have to send in written uh written proof that what they had that fulfilled all those prior requirements.

2660
04:51:48.000 --> 04:51:54.500
They would have to sign an affidavit that they met the conditions now.

2661
04:51:54.500 --> 04:51:56.500
Thank you.

2662
04:51:56.500 --> 04:51:58.500
Representative Eric.

2663
04:51:58.500 --> 04:52:00.500
Thank you, Mr.

2664
04:52:00.500 --> 04:52:06.000
Chair, and thank you, Representative Lange, for bringing this bill forward.

2665
04:52:06.000 --> 04:52:11.000
I have to say that we homeschooled our three kids.

2666
04:52:11.000 --> 04:52:15.000
My husband taught our kids how to drive.

2667
04:52:15.000 --> 04:52:20.000
So this is a very welcome bill in my eyes.

2668
04:52:20.000 --> 04:52:28.500
I'm just interested to know, do you know how many states allow parental instruction in this manner?

2669
04:52:28.500 --> 04:52:30.500
I know Connecticut does.

2670
04:52:30.500 --> 04:52:34.000
So I don't have the exact number.

2671
04:52:34.000 --> 04:52:59.000
number I know when I did this this is a retread bill I've done it I had this bill before and the last time I did the research there were eight states in in the United States that allowed for parents to do their teach their children how to drive.

2672
04:52:59.000 --> 04:53:03.000
Okay thank you very much I appreciate this.

2673
04:53:03.000 --> 04:53:05.000
See no further questions.

2674
04:53:05.000 --> 04:53:07.000
Thank you, Representative.

2675
04:53:07.000 --> 04:53:09.000
Mr.

2676
04:53:09.000 --> 04:53:13.000
Chair, I can just reiterate one last thing.

2677
04:53:13.000 --> 04:53:23.500
I just, again, just want to remind everybody, the written exam and the practical exam is the proof in the pudding.

2678
04:53:23.500 --> 04:53:30.500
So DMV always has the say on who gets a license and who doesn't.

2679
04:53:30.500 --> 04:53:39.500
And those two tests are what is supposed to delineate between a good driver and a bad driver.

2680
04:53:39.500 --> 04:53:41.500
Thank you, sir.

2681
04:53:41.500 --> 04:53:43.500
Chair recognizes the chair.

2682
04:53:43.500 --> 04:53:46.500
Cameron, the National Thank you, Mr.

2683
04:53:46.500 --> 04:53:49.500
Chairman and members of the committee.

2684
04:53:49.500 --> 04:53:55.000
The New Hampshire Drivers Education Teachers Association opposes House Bill 300.

2685
04:53:55.000 --> 04:53:59.000
The same bill has been presented twice already.

2686
04:53:59.000 --> 04:54:15.000
In 2018, the committee voted 16 to 3 to find the bill inexpedient to legislate, and in 2019, the vote was 15 to 2 for the same reasons that still exist today.

2687
04:54:15.000 --> 04:54:24.000
Driver education is only required for 16 and 17-year-old students who want a license before they turn 18.

2688
04:54:24.000 --> 04:54:44.500
It is but one piece of a system designed to produce safe and competent young drivers that includes driver education, 40 hours of parent supervised practice, and a graduated driver license system designed to build privileges over a period of time.

2689
04:54:44.500 --> 04:55:03.500
A parent, guardian, or responsible adult that can provide classroom instruction and behind-the-wheel training that is equivalent to an approved driver education course, as outlined in the bill, needs to meet the requirements of a driver education instructor.

2690
04:55:03.500 --> 04:55:20.500
That would require the same eight college courses and workshops, 300 hours of student teaching, knowledge and skills tests, background checks, a clean driving record, and oversight provided by the Department of Motor Vehicles.

2691
04:55:20.500 --> 04:55:27.500
Anything less would not meet the equivalent standard as laid out in this bill.

2692
04:55:27.500 --> 04:55:31.500
This bill has the potential to Thank you.

2693
04:55:31.500 --> 04:55:37.000
driving record and oversight provided by the Department of Motor Vehicles.

2694
04:55:37.000 --> 04:55:44.000
Anything less would not meet the equivalent standard as laid out in this bill.

2695
04:55:44.000 --> 04:55:49.000
This bill has the potential to cost the state money.

2696
04:55:49.000 --> 04:56:04.000
I'm sure the DMV will speak to the fiscal impact on their department, and I can imagine it could be expensive as it will create more traffic through their offices.

2697
04:56:04.000 --> 04:56:11.000
There are more than 60 driver education schools in the state, all small businesses.

2698
04:56:11.000 --> 04:56:26.500
Aside from the concerns of safety, this will put many of those schools out of business, resulting in fewer options for students who opt to keep a professional in the process.

2699
04:56:26.500 --> 04:56:32.500
This bill has the potential to cost the public money as well.

2700
04:56:32.500 --> 04:56:50.000
The insurance discount for taking a driver ed course ranges from 5 to 20 percent, depending on the company, and lasts until a student turns 21, as long as they keep their driving record clean.

2701
04:56:50.000 --> 04:57:06.500
I'm told by a colleague who is a former insurance professional that a state with positions on laws that have potential to weaken public safety has a negative impact effect on insurance rates.

2702
04:57:06.500 --> 04:57:26.000
Most parents haven't taken driver education courses for decades and their team going through a program is an opportunity for the entire family to tighten up their skills and learn current laws and practices as they relate to safety.

2703
04:57:26.000 --> 04:57:32.500
I appreciate my students reteaching their folks and they of course love that.

2704
04:57:32.500 --> 04:57:41.000
The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to change the face of driver ed forever in this state.

2705
04:57:41.000 --> 04:57:49.500
Instructors like teachers everywhere have been forced to reinvent classes to be delivered in a remote format.

2706
04:57:49.500 --> 04:57:55.000
To be clear, driver ed is not currently an online class.

2707
04:57:55.000 --> 04:57:57.500
It is a remote class.

2708
04:57:57.500 --> 04:58:06.000
Teachers and students can see each other and communicate as if they were still in a classroom.

2709
04:58:06.000 --> 04:58:24.500
As the worldwide emergency eventually passes, many industries, including driver education, will have an opportunity to explore how changes can be made that will improve the delivery and access of classes in ways we never thought possible.

2710
04:58:24.500 --> 04:58:35.000
New Hampshire DITA will be working to gather information from many instructors in the state to identify the advantages and challenges.

2711
04:58:35.000 --> 04:58:43.000
That knowledge has the potential to bring meaningful change to the system while maintaining public safety.

2712
04:58:43.000 --> 04:58:47.000
Thank you for the opportunity to speak today.

2713
04:58:47.000 --> 04:58:50.500
I would be happy to entertain questions.

2714
04:58:50.500 --> 04:58:52.500
Thank you.

2715
04:58:52.500 --> 04:58:58.500
And just for the record, I tried stopping you at the beginning.

2716
04:58:58.500 --> 04:59:04.500
Can you just state your name for the clerk for the record?

2717
04:59:04.500 --> 04:59:06.500
I'm so sorry.

2718
04:59:06.500 --> 04:59:10.500
Sharon Cameron, New Hampshire Drivers Education Teachers Association.

2719
04:59:10.500 --> 04:59:12.500
Thank you very much.

2720
04:59:12.500 --> 04:59:15.000
Any questions from the committee?

2721
04:59:15.000 --> 04:59:17.500
Seeing none, thank you again.

2722
04:59:17.500 --> 04:59:20.000
The chair recognizes Jana El-Sayed.

2723
04:59:20.000 --> 04:59:22.000
Sorry, Mr.

2724
04:59:22.000 --> 04:59:24.500
Chair, who did you say?

2725
04:59:24.500 --> 04:59:26.500
J-A-N-A, Jaina El-Sayed.

2726
04:59:26.500 --> 04:59:28.500
EL-SAYED.

2727
04:59:28.500 --> 04:59:31.000
I don't see her on.

2728
04:59:31.000 --> 04:59:34.000
Yeah, I don't see her either.

2729
04:59:34.000 --> 04:59:38.000
If she's there, could she raise her hand?

2730
04:59:38.000 --> 04:59:41.500
Okay, I'm going to check it now.

2731
04:59:41.500 --> 04:59:43.500
We'll return.

2732
04:59:43.500 --> 04:59:45.500
Chair recognizes.

2733
04:59:45.500 --> 04:59:47.500
Adrian Soti.

2734
04:59:47.500 --> 04:59:49.500
S-O-T-I.

2735
04:59:49.500 --> 04:59:51.500
Just promoted her.

2736
04:59:51.500 --> 04:59:53.500
What's that?

2737
04:59:53.500 --> 04:59:55.500
I just promoted.

2738
04:59:55.500 --> 04:59:57.500
What's that?

2739
04:59:57.500 --> 04:59:59.500
Just from over there.

2740
04:59:59.500 --> 05:00:01.500
Thank you.

2741
05:00:01.500 --> 05:00:03.500
You're still muted.

2742
05:00:03.500 --> 05:00:05.500
There you go.

2743
05:00:05.500 --> 05:00:07.500
Okay.

2744
05:00:07.500 --> 05:00:09.500
Works now.

2745
05:00:09.500 --> 05:00:11.500
Hello.

2746
05:00:11.500 --> 05:00:14.500
So my name is Adrian Soti.

2747
05:00:14.500 --> 05:00:31.500
as a member of the public, a mother to three kids, and a wife of Representative Julius Soti of Winham, who's also in favor, I'm here to testify in support of House Bill 300.

2748
05:00:31.500 --> 05:00:44.000
Granite State Driving School charged $600 for their drivers at program two years ago when my daughter completed it in person at Wyndham High School.

2749
05:00:44.000 --> 05:00:56.500
Currently, there is an emergency executive order due to COVID that wisely allows the classroom instruction of the driver's ed to be completed fully online.

2750
05:00:56.500 --> 05:01:00.500
The previous speaker said it's remote, not online.

2751
05:01:00.500 --> 05:01:04.500
I think they both have benefits and disadvantages.

2752
05:01:04.500 --> 05:01:15.500
Being online, the benefit of it is you could you could pause and rewind and listen again if you didn't catch something.

2753
05:01:15.500 --> 05:01:35.000
So the driver's ed is now fully remote and rather than only allowing 15 hours out of the 30 to be online, you would think that since there's no building involved, the fee for the course would be decreased.

2754
05:01:35.000 --> 05:01:46.500
But instead of getting a discount, it's going to cost $100 more to have my 16-year-old son complete the online Granite State course.

2755
05:01:46.500 --> 05:02:04.000
I'm here to tell you that I feel fully competent myself to teach this course with the help of the freely available driver's manual and the $20 supplemental textbook used by Granite State Driving School.

2756
05:02:04.000 --> 05:02:19.500
There are a multitude of instructional videos available on YouTube, as well as an interactive online course offered through AAA that's equivalent to 25 hours of in-class instruction for only $25.

2757
05:02:19.500 --> 05:02:24.000
Now, in addition, family schedules are an important factor.

2758
05:02:24.000 --> 05:02:37.000
I remember how difficult it was to find a program that worked with our schedule two years ago, and I'm facing the same difficulty right now.

2759
05:02:37.000 --> 05:02:50.000
The class we chose was already filled by the time the school received our application, even though their website still shows it's fully open and available.

2760
05:02:50.000 --> 05:02:55.500
The one that is still open doesn't work with our schedule.

2761
05:02:55.500 --> 05:03:02.000
Now we have to wait for the next time they offer the course.

2762
05:03:02.000 --> 05:03:15.000
Sometimes this means that a student has to wait months to find a course that fits into their schedule, even though they could begin studying immediately.

2763
05:03:15.000 --> 05:03:32.000
This, of course, doesn't stop them from practicing driving with their parents who can start teaching the rules found in your driver's manual right away instead of waiting for the school to do it.

2764
05:03:32.000 --> 05:03:40.000
New Hampshire requires that those under 18 years of age drive 10 hours with an instructor.

2765
05:03:40.000 --> 05:03:47.500
However, it doesn't make those 10 hours a prerequisite to starting practicing with a parent.

2766
05:03:47.500 --> 05:03:57.000
This way, students may have already completed the 40 hours of driving practice required for applying for a license.

2767
05:03:57.000 --> 05:04:08.500
Does it really make a difference whether they get an additional 10 hours through an instructor or through another adult with a license?

2768
05:04:08.500 --> 05:04:14.500
And as it was said earlier, the proof is in the test.

2769
05:04:14.500 --> 05:04:28.500
A young person can take a written and practical test at the DMV at the age of 18 without any of the requirements spelled out in RSA 26319.

2770
05:04:28.500 --> 05:04:45.500
A few months before their 18th birthday, however, they are burdened with an expensive course, even if they have studied and drove under the guidance of their parents for more than the required time.

2771
05:04:45.500 --> 05:05:00.000
If the DMV test is reliable, regardless of who prepared the young motorist, passing the written test and the driving test will serve as proof that preparation was satisfactory.

2772
05:05:00.000 --> 05:05:15.000
Therefore, I strongly recommend that this committee adopt this bill and acknowledge the many hours of preparation that parents can provide as an alternative to the approved driver's ed program.

2773
05:05:15.000 --> 05:05:17.000
Thank you very much.

2774
05:05:17.000 --> 05:05:19.500
Any questions of the committee?

2775
05:05:19.500 --> 05:05:22.000
Seeing none, thank you again.

2776
05:05:22.000 --> 05:05:24.000
Thank you.

2777
05:05:24.000 --> 05:05:30.000
Chair recognizes Dan Goodman from the AAA and opposition to the bill.

2778
05:05:30.000 --> 05:05:33.000
Hello, can you hear me okay?

2779
05:05:33.000 --> 05:05:35.000
You can.

2780
05:05:35.000 --> 05:05:37.000
Good afternoon, sir.

2781
05:05:37.000 --> 05:05:39.000
Thank you, Chairman.

2782
05:05:39.000 --> 05:05:41.000
Sorry about that.

2783
05:05:41.000 --> 05:05:45.000
When I unmuted it, I tried to restart.

2784
05:05:45.000 --> 05:05:52.500
So, Chairman Walsh and committee members, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity.

2785
05:05:52.500 --> 05:05:56.500
For the record, my name is Dan Goodman.

2786
05:05:56.500 --> 05:06:01.500
I'm a public affairs manager for AAA Northern New England.

2787
05:06:01.500 --> 05:06:05.500
And I'm speaking in opposition to HB 300.

2788
05:06:05.500 --> 05:06:10.500
I submitted some written testimony, so I'll be really brief.

2789
05:06:10.500 --> 05:06:47.000
AAA has done a lot of research around teen drivers, and we know that they're the most vulnerable drivers, and as someone said earlier, I like that they're our most valuable resources, and we know teen drivers are three times as likely as adults to be involved in a deadly crash, and we know there was research done a few years ago at the Texas Transportation Institute that looked at this very issue.

2790
05:06:47.000 --> 05:06:55.000
They completed a comparative evaluation of parent-taught driver education versus the traditional instructor-based driver education program.

2791
05:06:55.000 --> 05:07:13.500
The research determined that Texas teenagers taught to drive by someone other than a professional driving instructor are more likely to be convicted of driving violations, including speeding, and more likely to be involved in serious crashes.

2792
05:07:13.500 --> 05:07:36.000
They also found that after the GDL license restrictions, like night and passenger restrictions that were talked about earlier, were lifted, parent-taught drivers are nearly three times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than those that were taught by professional driving instructors.

2793
05:07:36.000 --> 05:07:38.000
I do agree.

2794
05:07:38.000 --> 05:07:54.000
I do really agree that parents and guardians play a really crucial role in the learning to drive process, but they should not be considered a substitute for the professional in-car instruction.

2795
05:07:54.000 --> 05:08:05.500
So that's all I have to say, and I really appreciate the opportunity to speak, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

2796
05:08:05.500 --> 05:08:07.500
Any questions?

2797
05:08:07.500 --> 05:08:09.500
Never mind, Representative Hill.

2798
05:08:09.500 --> 05:08:11.500
Thank you, Mr.

2799
05:08:11.500 --> 05:08:15.500
Chairman and thank you for taking my question.

2800
05:08:15.500 --> 05:08:23.000
I understand the analysis that was done on parent-directed instruction versus a professional company instruction.

2801
05:08:23.000 --> 05:08:41.000
But in New Hampshire, where a student just needs to wait till age 18 and then they can have no instruction, is it not better for there to be some parental instruction rather than no instruction?

2802
05:08:41.000 --> 05:08:45.000
Thank you very much, Representative, for that question.

2803
05:08:45.000 --> 05:08:55.500
I don't know if I can answer that completely, but I'll try to answer it in a couple of different ways.

2804
05:08:55.500 --> 05:09:04.500
I actually think it's problematic that individuals can wait until they're 18 and then just get their license.

2805
05:09:04.500 --> 05:09:15.000
I think we should have some sort of evaluation of their driving ability before they can just get their driver's license.

2806
05:09:15.000 --> 05:09:23.000
And I actually forgot what I was going to say on the second part of this.

2807
05:09:23.000 --> 05:09:26.000
Happens to us all the time.

2808
05:09:26.000 --> 05:09:28.000
Sorry about that.

2809
05:09:28.000 --> 05:09:30.000
Any further questions?

2810
05:09:30.000 --> 05:09:33.000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

2811
05:09:33.000 --> 05:09:37.500
That is the last one I have signed up.

2812
05:09:37.500 --> 05:09:44.500
Let me check for raised hands if anybody else wishes to speak on this.

2813
05:09:44.500 --> 05:09:47.500
Yeah, there's two in the queue.

2814
05:09:47.500 --> 05:09:49.500
What's that?

2815
05:09:49.500 --> 05:09:55.000
There's two people in the queue, Richard Dupont and Gail Hoyt.

2816
05:09:55.000 --> 05:09:57.000
Okay.

2817
05:09:57.000 --> 05:09:59.000
Mr.

2818
05:09:59.000 --> 05:10:01.000
Dupont.

2819
05:10:01.000 --> 05:10:03.000
Sorry about the delay.

2820
05:10:03.000 --> 05:10:11.500
The system, it causes us to, there's a slight delay and then you have to unmute yourself.

2821
05:10:11.500 --> 05:10:14.500
So I apologize for the delay.

2822
05:10:14.500 --> 05:10:16.500
It's not you.

2823
05:10:16.500 --> 05:10:20.000
We've been dealing with it all day.

2824
05:10:20.000 --> 05:10:26.000
I know you are, but I feel like I need to apologize.

2825
05:10:26.000 --> 05:10:32.000
You threw the bags into my eyes through the monitor, I'm sure.

2826
05:10:32.000 --> 05:10:34.000
No comment.

2827
05:10:34.000 --> 05:10:36.000
Just kidding.

2828
05:10:36.000 --> 05:10:42.000
So, again, thank you for allowing me to speak with you today.

2829
05:10:42.000 --> 05:10:49.500
And I've already currently previously introduced myself, so I'm just going to go into it.

2830
05:10:49.500 --> 05:10:54.000
I speak today in opposition to House Bill 300.

2831
05:10:54.000 --> 05:11:08.000
it appears to speak to a change in the language of RSA 263-14, which is the original youth licenses, operators licenses, and RSA 263-19, which is driver's education.

2832
05:11:08.000 --> 05:11:26.500
And again, as I spoke earlier, in the past, the state of New Hampshire, the state legislature spoke to the quality of our state's program that is currently in place and what that program should look like.

2833
05:11:26.500 --> 05:11:56.500
And it can be found again in RSA 263.19 and also in RSA 21-P.14, which speaks to the development of rules governing driver's education, specifically to the Department of Safety Administrative Rule 3100 series and to RSA 26344, which is motor vehicle driver schools, as it relates to the driver's education course, the schools and the qualifications of those instructors.

2834
05:11:56.500 --> 05:12:23.000
The state legislature, again, with all the Department of Education, the Department of Drivers Education Association, the Division of Motor Vehicles, the state legislature put together a really quality program to have certified instructors teach our young drivers how to properly and safely operate a motor vehicle upon the roadways of New Hampshire.

2835
05:12:23.000 --> 05:12:27.500
This same program has been successful for many years.

2836
05:12:27.500 --> 05:12:37.000
It is understood that most parents are not professional instructors and are not seemingly attempting to become professional instructors.

2837
05:12:37.000 --> 05:12:57.500
However, the process to become a professional instructor is important and that the level of training they initially receive is college level and the level of training that they are expected to maintain to maintain their certifications is also very important.

2838
05:12:57.500 --> 05:13:03.500
It's a distinction between a regular person and a certified professional instructor.

2839
05:13:03.500 --> 05:13:22.500
Each school and each instructor is held to a standard above a normal person in the driver education program they teach to our young drivers is a quality program that our state has again benefited for many years.

2840
05:13:22.500 --> 05:13:36.000
The language suggested to be added to RSA 26319 would have an overwhelming consequence on the driver education office and subsequently to the state as a whole.

2841
05:13:36.000 --> 05:13:53.000
To effectively review each waiver would take hours and conceivably months to verify that the driver's education program envisioned by our state legislature was actually taught and in what manner it was actually taught.

2842
05:13:53.000 --> 05:14:07.000
The review would significantly reduce the time now used to monitor the certified driving schools and certified instructors for compliance with the laws and rules governing driver's education.

2843
05:14:07.000 --> 05:14:28.500
The answer of questions through phone calls from New Hampshire residents is also part of our function and we take calls and answer questions from persons from other states who wish to transfer here and transfer the driver's education program from another state.

2844
05:14:28.500 --> 05:14:40.000
In reality, each waiver would have been taught by a different parent or guardian or, as the language is written, a responsible adult.

2845
05:14:40.000 --> 05:14:48.500
Now, I don't, addressing that, potentially a young adult could be an 18-year-old who is deemed responsible.

2846
05:14:48.500 --> 05:14:57.000
And I have to wonder about how much driving experience and skills that that person would have.

2847
05:14:57.000 --> 05:15:19.500
Every person in New Hampshire has different driving and teaching abilities, and there's no way to really ensure that the driver education program intended to be taught to our young drivers was taught correctly and in keeping with the program set forth by our legislature.

2848
05:15:19.500 --> 05:15:35.000
An example of this, you can draft your own number, but I'm going to use 10,000 different people could conceivably be teaching how to operate a motor vehicle 10,000 different ways.

2849
05:15:35.000 --> 05:15:47.500
Some could be fathers, mothers, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and in some circumstances, maybe even a sibling as a guardian at a very young age.

2850
05:15:47.500 --> 05:15:56.000
All of these people will have different ages, different skill sets, and different driving and life experience.

2851
05:15:56.000 --> 05:16:14.000
Somebody said something about parents are, you know, are quite capable, and I agree that the parents are very capable of raising their children, But driver's education is an important aspect of driving in our communities.

2852
05:16:14.000 --> 05:16:29.500
An example from my own experience is, and I think we all can relate, you have the parents or potential parents that will drive down the highway at the speed limit.

2853
05:16:29.500 --> 05:16:36.000
Then you have the parents that, oh, it's okay to do five over.

2854
05:16:36.000 --> 05:16:42.000
Then you have the parents that are okay to do 10 over.

2855
05:16:42.000 --> 05:16:46.500
I mean, this just goes on and on, right?

2856
05:16:46.500 --> 05:17:00.500
So everybody has a different threshold and view of what is proper and what is accepted and which is actually the legal law of driving down a road.

2857
05:17:00.500 --> 05:17:06.500
Not to mention, people have different driving skills and different driving conditions.

2858
05:17:06.500 --> 05:17:21.500
Driver's education, the schools and the instructors keep up with the times, and they also teach the safety features of all the vehicles that are out there, and that's ever-changing.

2859
05:17:21.500 --> 05:17:24.500
The technology technology is ever changing.

2860
05:17:24.500 --> 05:17:34.500
So to compare a driver's education program from the past isn't fair and isn't doing justice because technology is changing.

2861
05:17:34.500 --> 05:17:51.500
There are different features and these schools and these instructors are keeping up with that pace and they're actually able to address the blind spots, able to address different safety features of the vehicles.

2862
05:17:51.500 --> 05:18:01.000
The 80%, the comment of 80% of the driving time for a young adult is with the parents, okay?

2863
05:18:01.000 --> 05:18:12.000
But the 40 hours is designated to augment what they've already been taught, not to teach them driver's education all over again.

2864
05:18:12.000 --> 05:18:17.000
That's just to provide additional driving to the young adult.

2865
05:18:17.000 --> 05:18:25.500
We want them to be safe before they actually go out on their own on our roadways.

2866
05:18:25.500 --> 05:18:36.000
Florida, for example, requires that you drive for one year with a licensed adult before you can even get your license.

2867
05:18:36.000 --> 05:18:39.000
So again, each state is different.

2868
05:18:39.000 --> 05:18:50.000
The checks and balances regarding, you know, understanding that test at the DMV, the tests at the DMV are the basic rules.

2869
05:18:50.000 --> 05:18:52.000
That's the comment.

2870
05:18:52.000 --> 05:18:54.500
But that's only the basics.

2871
05:18:54.500 --> 05:18:57.000
Everyone takes the same exam.

2872
05:18:57.000 --> 05:18:59.000
Yes, they do.

2873
05:18:59.000 --> 05:19:05.000
But I would argue that instruction other than standardized training is important.

2874
05:19:05.000 --> 05:19:14.000
And that test that's being taken at the DMV is only a snapshot of your actual driving experience.

2875
05:19:14.000 --> 05:19:17.500
It's a very short amount of time.

2876
05:19:17.500 --> 05:19:24.000
It's not the full 100% gauge of what your driving ability actually is.

2877
05:19:24.000 --> 05:19:37.000
I can talk to you about my father-in-law now who's deceased, but we, you know, he was elderly and he had a whole different driving skill.

2878
05:19:37.000 --> 05:19:41.500
He was perfect when he took his driving test.

2879
05:19:41.500 --> 05:19:47.000
but then after that, he was a mess on the road.

2880
05:19:47.000 --> 05:19:49.000
Sorry to keep going.

2881
05:19:49.000 --> 05:19:51.000
No problem.

2882
05:19:51.000 --> 05:20:09.000
In closing, the laws and rules as they are at this time allow for a quality driver education program to be delivered to our young drivers by training certified instructors which ultimately keeps our road safe.

2883
05:20:09.000 --> 05:20:14.500
Thank you and I will take any questions at this time.

2884
05:20:14.500 --> 05:20:16.500
Thank you.

2885
05:20:16.500 --> 05:20:18.500
A couple of questions.

2886
05:20:18.500 --> 05:20:20.500
Representative Thank you Mr.

2887
05:20:20.500 --> 05:20:23.000
Chairman I'll be very quick.

2888
05:20:23.000 --> 05:20:35.500
TrooperPont, I'm a little concerned about the vagueness here of how the student would go with their guardian to prove that they'd had the training.

2889
05:20:35.500 --> 05:20:45.500
Do you have any initial thoughts on what they would have to provide to be able to prove equivalent training?

2890
05:20:45.500 --> 05:20:48.000
What form that could take?

2891
05:20:48.000 --> 05:21:02.000
Right now, as it's written, it's a waiver from the parent or an affidavit saying that they provided the program the way it was intended by our legislature.

2892
05:21:02.000 --> 05:21:16.500
But other than providing the curriculum that you taught your young adult and, you know, check marks of, oh, yes, I did this, I did this, I did this.

2893
05:21:16.500 --> 05:21:28.500
I don't know how else they would be able to prove it unless they downloaded an approved program and then went through that checklist.

2894
05:21:28.500 --> 05:21:33.000
But how would you prove that that actually occurred?

2895
05:21:33.000 --> 05:21:35.000
I don't know.

2896
05:21:35.000 --> 05:22:03.000
I mean, I guess there is an incentive, and you hate to say this, but for parents to just get through the program, the process, like the parents that would drive more than 10 miles an hour over the speed limit, just because they want to have their son or daughter drive themselves to soccer practice.

2897
05:22:03.000 --> 05:22:06.500
There's no way to fact check it.

2898
05:22:06.500 --> 05:22:10.500
And, yeah, there's just no oversight on it.

2899
05:22:10.500 --> 05:22:16.500
And how would you know that the program, these drivers are safe?

2900
05:22:16.500 --> 05:22:25.000
At least right now with the driving education schools, they are mandated and there's oversight on them.

2901
05:22:25.000 --> 05:22:34.500
And they know that they need to teach everything in the proper way and manner as it was intended.

2902
05:22:34.500 --> 05:22:36.500
Thank you.

2903
05:22:36.500 --> 05:22:38.500
You're welcome.

2904
05:22:38.500 --> 05:22:41.500
I see another question, Senator Valhara.

2905
05:22:41.500 --> 05:22:43.500
Thank you, Mr.

2906
05:22:43.500 --> 05:22:46.500
Chair, and thank you, Trooper DuPont.

2907
05:22:46.500 --> 05:22:49.500
I just had one quick question.

2908
05:22:49.500 --> 05:23:06.000
Don't we already have a law on the book saying that if you're learning to drive, the person, the adult driving with you has to be over at least the age of 25?

2909
05:23:06.000 --> 05:23:08.000
Yes.

2910
05:23:08.000 --> 05:23:13.000
Okay, so it couldn't be an 18-year-old going with them.

2911
05:23:13.000 --> 05:23:17.500
I just wanted to make sure that part was...

2912
05:23:17.500 --> 05:23:25.000
Well, that is a good point, but that does not say that in this bill.

2913
05:23:25.000 --> 05:23:27.000
Okay, any more questions?

2914
05:23:27.000 --> 05:23:29.000
Trooper DuPont.

2915
05:23:29.000 --> 05:23:32.000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

2916
05:23:32.000 --> 05:23:35.500
Who is the representative of the Herald?

2917
05:23:35.500 --> 05:23:39.000
We have somebody in the queue still.

2918
05:23:39.000 --> 05:23:41.000
Thank you.

2919
05:23:41.000 --> 05:23:44.000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

2920
05:23:44.000 --> 05:23:47.500
Who is the representative of the Herald?

2921
05:23:47.500 --> 05:23:51.000
We have somebody in the queue still.

2922
05:23:51.000 --> 05:23:53.000
We have Director Bileski.

2923
05:23:53.000 --> 05:23:55.000
Sorry.

2924
05:23:55.000 --> 05:23:57.000
I see a D.

2925
05:23:57.000 --> 05:23:59.000
Oh.

2926
05:23:59.000 --> 05:24:03.000
She put her hand down as I was.

2927
05:24:03.000 --> 05:24:05.000
Put her hand down.

2928
05:24:05.000 --> 05:24:07.000
I'm still here.

2929
05:24:07.000 --> 05:24:09.000
Can you hear me?

2930
05:24:09.000 --> 05:24:11.000
Okay.

2931
05:24:11.000 --> 05:24:13.000
Chair recognizes Gail Hall.

2932
05:24:13.000 --> 05:24:16.000
Hall, you're going to make this.

2933
05:24:16.000 --> 05:24:19.000
It's the director that is on.

2934
05:24:19.000 --> 05:24:59.500
Gail put her hand down as I was getting ready to put her on the director blackie i apologize thank you mr chairman um thank you again for giving me some time for the record elizabeth bielakki director of motor vehicles um i just want to add a few things to trooper dupont's testimony um and specifically speaking to fiscal impact and i think the committee really has a good gauge on on some of our concerns on this as well.

2935
05:24:59.500 --> 05:25:13.000
The way I interpret it, we really do have the responsibility to ensure the equivalency of the course that's being taught by a parent or responsible adult.

2936
05:25:13.000 --> 05:25:31.500
The way I would look at it is that we need to ensure that we review every single waiver that's submitted to us for a waiver of driver education and ensure that those standards have been met.

2937
05:25:31.500 --> 05:25:53.500
As Trooper DuPont has mentioned, we do have a really strict oversight of driver education schools right now, which means that they are regularly audited to ensure that they remain compliant with our regulation, that they maintain classroom standards and curriculum standards as well.

2938
05:25:53.500 --> 05:26:22.000
If we were to apply the similar standards to these waivers, we really would need to review each one of those submitted to us to ensure that that was met, unless the legislature intends this to be a self-certification or some kind of an affidavit, in which case I think the law would need to be adjusted.

2939
05:26:22.000 --> 05:26:25.500
There was a question regarding the 25-year-old.

2940
05:26:25.500 --> 05:26:38.500
Again, as Tupper Dupont stated, this law does not require someone to be over the age of 25 in order to teach this class as well.

2941
05:26:38.500 --> 05:26:44.000
So I think that would need to be clarified as well.

2942
05:26:44.000 --> 05:26:50.000
And again, I think we have a great program in the state.

2943
05:26:50.000 --> 05:27:09.500
In addition to just teaching classroom behind the wheel observation, the different instructors introduce different type of visual aids and other aids in addition to the curriculum that's currently required to ensure that the students really receive quality education.

2944
05:27:09.500 --> 05:27:20.500
I think the prior speaker spoke to the certification of the teachers and the classroom education, the driver education schools as well.

2945
05:27:20.500 --> 05:27:23.500
So I'll leave it at that.

2946
05:27:23.500 --> 05:27:37.500
From a fiscal impact perspective, I think I would require additional personnel in order to really meet that standard of reviewing the equivalency of those parent taught classes.

2947
05:27:37.500 --> 05:27:44.500
We have about 13,000 or so students that go through driver education each year.

2948
05:27:44.500 --> 05:27:56.500
And, you know, take a percentage, 50% of those being parent-taught, that is a lot of equivalent waivers that we would have to review.

2949
05:27:56.500 --> 05:28:04.000
With that, I will close my testimony and answer any questions that you might have.

2950
05:28:04.000 --> 05:28:06.000
Thank you very much.

2951
05:28:06.000 --> 05:28:08.500
Any questions from the committee?

2952
05:28:08.500 --> 05:28:10.500
Seeing none.

2953
05:28:10.500 --> 05:28:12.500
Thank you, Director.

2954
05:28:12.500 --> 05:28:14.500
Thank you.

2955
05:28:14.500 --> 05:28:16.500
Okay.

2956
05:28:16.500 --> 05:28:19.500
I see nobody else signed up.

2957
05:28:19.500 --> 05:28:23.000
Is there anybody else in the queue?

2958
05:28:23.000 --> 05:28:25.000
Uh-oh.

2959
05:28:25.000 --> 05:28:27.000
I see hands.

2960
05:28:27.000 --> 05:28:32.000
Gail raised her hand again, so I just promoted her.

2961
05:28:32.000 --> 05:28:34.000
You say that one.

2962
05:28:34.000 --> 05:28:36.000
Gail Holt.

2963
05:28:36.000 --> 05:28:41.000
She just raised her hand again, so I promoted her.

2964
05:28:41.000 --> 05:28:44.000
You say that one more time.

2965
05:28:44.000 --> 05:28:46.000
Gail Holt.

2966
05:28:46.000 --> 05:28:51.500
She just raised her hand again, so I promote her now.

2967
05:28:51.500 --> 05:28:53.500
There we go.

2968
05:28:53.500 --> 05:28:55.500
Can you hear me?

2969
05:28:55.500 --> 05:28:58.000
I can hear you now.

2970
05:28:58.000 --> 05:29:00.000
Good afternoon.

2971
05:29:00.000 --> 05:29:02.000
Thank you very much.

2972
05:29:02.000 --> 05:29:05.000
So my name is Gay Holt.

2973
05:29:05.000 --> 05:29:12.000
I have taught driver education in the state of New Hampshire for 35 years.

2974
05:29:12.000 --> 05:29:22.000
And I just kind of wanted to weigh in on things because I've left a lot of changes over time.

2975
05:29:22.000 --> 05:29:29.000
I'll make a quick way to run a lot of time on this committee.

2976
05:29:29.000 --> 05:29:45.500
So as Sharon Cameron had explained, that's the head of the association currently for driver's ed, you have a discount on insurance, which is gained from having taken driver's ed for the students.

2977
05:29:45.500 --> 05:29:49.500
I know the fiscal impact was one of...

2978
05:29:49.500 --> 05:29:52.000
Association currently for driver's ed.

2979
05:29:52.000 --> 05:30:00.500
You have a discount on insurance, which is gained from having taken driver's ed for the students.

2980
05:30:00.500 --> 05:30:08.000
I know the fiscal impact was one of Representative Lang's concerns, which I totally get.

2981
05:30:08.000 --> 05:30:18.500
Unfortunately, as everybody is seeing in their own life, there is an amount of money and percentages every year going up.

2982
05:30:18.500 --> 05:30:25.000
My insurance for my commercial driver's ed this year just went up substantially.

2983
05:30:25.000 --> 05:30:29.000
So I understand concerns on the money end.

2984
05:30:29.000 --> 05:30:39.500
As far as the pandemic, it's not only New Hampshire, we are currently doing recertification time right now as driving instructors.

2985
05:30:39.500 --> 05:30:44.500
We have to do 51 additional hours every three years.

2986
05:30:44.500 --> 05:30:58.500
And in fact, Sharon Cameron, who spoke earlier, and myself are going to be logging on in just over an hour for another four-hour seminar towards that goal.

2987
05:30:58.500 --> 05:31:11.500
One of the things that we listened to last night was in reference to the pandemic has basically just taken this across the whole United States.

2988
05:31:11.500 --> 05:31:16.000
This is not prevalent to just New Hampshire currently.

2989
05:31:16.000 --> 05:31:23.000
Everything has kind of gone sideways, as we all know, with our stay-at-home orders.

2990
05:31:23.000 --> 05:31:27.000
And I'm currently doing classroom remotely on Zoom.

2991
05:31:27.000 --> 05:31:57.000
The one thing I am learning is always to be professional, which I always am, but now I'm learning there are parents sitting to the side off screen listening to driver's ed, which you know what I'm really happy about because I am teaching not only the student, but every time I'm hearing the parents saying, I didn't know that.

2992
05:31:57.000 --> 05:31:59.000
I didn't know that.

2993
05:31:59.000 --> 05:32:01.000
I learned this.

2994
05:32:01.000 --> 05:32:03.000
I learned that.

2995
05:32:03.000 --> 05:32:10.500
And I've done this long enough that I've had multiple children in the same family.

2996
05:32:10.500 --> 05:32:22.500
And as I'm told by those parents, every time one of their students takes driver's ed with me, they're learning more and new things.

2997
05:32:22.500 --> 05:32:30.500
So as far as staying up on technology, I'm actually teaching in a 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan.

2998
05:32:30.500 --> 05:32:33.000
My kids are loving it.

2999
05:32:33.000 --> 05:32:37.000
It has all kinds of technology on it.

3000
05:32:37.000 --> 05:32:48.000
But at the same time, if I know the car they're driving in doesn't have a backup camera, I shut it off.

3001
05:32:48.000 --> 05:32:53.000
I tell them don't rely on those blind spot detectors.

3002
05:32:53.000 --> 05:33:00.500
So there are many things that I've learned over the years that I keep evolving.

3003
05:33:00.500 --> 05:33:05.500
As my husband says, every day is a learning day.

3004
05:33:05.500 --> 05:33:29.500
And one of the things often that we're seeing, and I see this even this morning with a student, is while I appreciate the parents being right there with us doing the backup of the 40 hours, which is meant to reinforce what we're doing on the roads.

3005
05:33:29.500 --> 05:33:35.000
I've also learned that they've watched their parents for 16 years.

3006
05:33:35.000 --> 05:33:58.500
And often I am trying to rectify bad habits that have come about and trying to explain to kids why you stop behind stop lines for three seconds, why you scan an intersection, you know, why you look over your shoulder, why you watch your back end.

3007
05:33:58.500 --> 05:34:07.500
And I'm not going to be here to teach you driver's ed because I've done it long enough.

3008
05:34:07.500 --> 05:34:11.000
I could probably do it for hours.

3009
05:34:11.000 --> 05:34:21.000
I think, if anything, perhaps you should keep the requirement for the 16 and 17 year olds as it stands.

3010
05:34:21.000 --> 05:34:38.000
one representative did bring forward the thought that well what if at 18 they're just able to I believe it was keep the requirement for the 16 and 17 year olds as it stands.

3011
05:34:38.000 --> 05:34:49.500
One representative did bring forward the thought that, well, what if at 18, they're just able to, I believe it was Representative Hill.

3012
05:34:49.500 --> 05:34:56.500
And you're right, Representative Hill, you know, maybe there should be education for everybody.

3013
05:34:56.500 --> 05:35:08.500
But maybe at that point, it becomes requirement on your end, that anyone 18 and above is required to do some kind of program.

3014
05:35:08.500 --> 05:35:19.500
The driver's manual is totally separate in the learning process from what I'm doing in my program, just so that that's understood.

3015
05:35:19.500 --> 05:35:29.500
As I tell students, the program is the theory of driving, the driver's manual are the laws of our state.

3016
05:35:29.500 --> 05:35:46.500
And last but not least, I'd just like to close with explaining Trooper Haynes gave testimony in the prior committee meeting that you just had in far as the bill that went before this.

3017
05:35:46.500 --> 05:36:00.000
And as he explained, due to the pandemic, they were in the process of reevaluating the driver ed program here in New Hampshire on a national level.

3018
05:36:00.000 --> 05:36:10.000
And he was asking that if we could hold off and wait, I think that would be a wonderful suggestion.

3019
05:36:10.000 --> 05:36:13.000
And on that, I will close.

3020
05:36:13.000 --> 05:36:17.500
And if anyone has questions, happy to answer them.

3021
05:36:17.500 --> 05:36:19.500
Thank you very much.

3022
05:36:19.500 --> 05:36:22.000
Any questions from the committee?

3023
05:36:22.000 --> 05:36:24.000
Thank you.

3024
05:36:24.000 --> 05:36:26.000
Thank you again.

3025
05:36:26.000 --> 05:36:28.000
Okay.

3026
05:36:28.000 --> 05:36:31.000
Representative O'Hara, is there anybody up?

3027
05:36:31.000 --> 05:36:49.500
I see no hands raised on my screen yeah representative tom plo jay i think or no not is that pomper tom prochar sorry that was plojay is that oh okay uh chair recognizes recognizes tom pres.

3028
05:36:49.500 --> 05:36:51.500
Good morning, Mr.

3029
05:36:51.500 --> 05:36:54.000
Chairman, members of the committee.

3030
05:36:54.000 --> 05:36:57.000
Thank you for taking my testimony.

3031
05:36:57.000 --> 05:36:59.000
I'll be very brief.

3032
05:36:59.000 --> 05:37:03.500
I just wanted to identify a couple of things.

3033
05:37:03.500 --> 05:37:07.000
Gay Holt had mentioned the NITS assessment.

3034
05:37:07.000 --> 05:37:23.500
I was going to bring that up and ask the committee what they hold off on making any dramatic changes to the driver's ed program until we see the results from that assessment.

3035
05:37:23.500 --> 05:37:29.500
I also heard a number of concerns around access to driver education.

3036
05:37:29.500 --> 05:37:42.500
And as Representative Lang had mentioned, the governor issued emergency order number 18 to allow for the classroom portion of driver education to be conducted remotely.

3037
05:37:42.500 --> 05:37:56.500
And I wanted to notify the committee that the Senate has recently introduced Senate Bill 155, which would put that emergency order into effect through January 31st, 2022.

3038
05:37:56.500 --> 05:38:21.500
And also in regards to access, in 2019, the legislature in this committee approved Senate Bill 60, which allowed for 15 hours of the classroom instruction to be conducted online, which I believe we are currently in the process of stakeholders of meeting with the director on developing those rules.

3039
05:38:21.500 --> 05:38:25.500
So I think greater access will be forthcoming.

3040
05:38:25.500 --> 05:38:39.000
And with that, I'll close my testimony, but just want to make the committee aware of some of those steps that have been taken in recent years.

3041
05:38:39.000 --> 05:39:06.000
you mr presall any questions from the committee seeing none thank you again i see no more hands up all right um not including the people that spoke originally signed in 33 and support 10 opposed to house bill 300 again it doesn include the people that have raised their hand after the fact.

3042
05:39:06.000 --> 05:39:13.000
So with that, I'm going to close the public hearing on House Bill 300.

3043
05:39:13.000 --> 05:39:15.000
Okay.

3044
05:39:15.000 --> 05:39:22.000
Before we get into the next one, we are a half an hour late.

3045
05:39:22.000 --> 05:39:27.000
I'll have to take some of the blame for that.

3046
05:39:27.000 --> 05:39:38.500
But I'm also going to blame the fact that not everybody gets up and signs up prior to when we start these hearings.

3047
05:39:38.500 --> 05:39:51.500
So when I only see three or four people signed up, I don't bother putting time constraints on anybody because I don't think I need to.

3048
05:39:51.500 --> 05:40:09.000
And then before I know it, there's 10 more people that are signed up on the screen, and I don't think it's fair that I start time constraints when the people before them didn't happen.

3049
05:40:09.000 --> 05:40:13.000
That's why I didn't do it this time.

3050
05:40:13.000 --> 05:40:17.000
It's never going to happen again, trust me.

3051
05:40:17.000 --> 05:40:23.500
We have time constraints on the next one, right out of the gate.

3052
05:40:23.500 --> 05:40:29.500
We have a slew of people that are signed up for it.

3053
05:40:29.500 --> 05:40:48.000
This is not favoritism on any bill, but again, with the system and not knowing who is actually signed up ahead of time, not even having an idea of who's going to be makes it very difficult.

3054
05:40:48.000 --> 05:41:03.000
That being said, before we get into House Bill 251, I don't know what you need to put on the screen to let everybody aware that we're not going anywhere.

3055
05:41:03.000 --> 05:41:08.000
This one will be heard just a little bit late.

3056
05:41:08.000 --> 05:41:13.500
That being said, I'll see you all at five past three.

3057
05:41:13.500 --> 05:41:15.500
at least.

3058
05:41:15.500 --> 05:41:17.500
Thank you.

3059
05:41:17.500 --> 05:41:19.500
Thank you.

3060
05:41:19.500 --> 05:41:21.500
Thank you.

3061
05:41:21.500 --> 05:41:23.500
Thank you.

3062
05:41:23.500 --> 05:41:25.500
Thank you.

3063
05:41:25.500 --> 05:41:27.500
Thank you.

3064
05:41:27.500 --> 05:41:29.500
Thank you.

3065
05:41:29.500 --> 05:41:31.500
Thank you.

3066
05:41:31.500 --> 05:41:33.500
Thank you.

3067
05:41:33.500 --> 05:41:35.500
Thank you.

3068
05:41:35.500 --> 05:41:37.500
Okay.

3069
05:41:37.500 --> 05:41:39.500
Thank you.

3070
05:41:39.500 --> 05:41:58.000
Before I open this up, like I said at the end of the previous hearing, it's very hard to gauge, and I want to be fair to everybody so I'm going to start with a time limit.

3071
05:41:58.000 --> 05:42:04.500
Right now I've got seven people signed up, that signed up in advance.

3072
05:42:04.500 --> 05:42:17.000
The way the trend is going, I have no reason to believe it won't be 14 by the time we're at the end of it.

3073
05:42:17.000 --> 05:42:22.500
Again, I do not like doing time restraints after the fact.

3074
05:42:22.500 --> 05:42:27.500
I think it's fair if we start off that way.

3075
05:42:27.500 --> 05:42:34.500
It's got nothing to do with the bill, just the time of the day.

3076
05:42:34.500 --> 05:42:45.500
So our vice chair has been generous enough to decide we're going to do four minutes, and he'll be watching the clock.

3077
05:42:45.500 --> 05:43:01.500
So with that, I'm going to open up the public hearing on House Bill 251, an act requiring children under the age of two years to be strained in a motor vehicle.

3078
05:43:01.500 --> 05:43:03.500
Representative Fenton.

3079
05:43:03.500 --> 05:43:05.500
I'm here.

3080
05:43:05.500 --> 05:43:07.500
Can you hear me?

3081
05:43:07.500 --> 05:43:09.500
You can.

3082
05:43:09.500 --> 05:43:11.500
Good afternoon, sir.

3083
05:43:11.500 --> 05:43:13.500
Good afternoon.

3084
05:43:13.500 --> 05:43:15.500
Thank you, Mr.

3085
05:43:15.500 --> 05:43:19.500
Chair and ladies and gentlemen of the committee.

3086
05:43:19.500 --> 05:43:21.500
My name is Rep.

3087
05:43:21.500 --> 05:43:23.500
Donovan Fenton.

3088
05:43:23.500 --> 05:43:26.500
For the record, I represent Keene.

3089
05:43:26.500 --> 05:43:40.500
I'm here today to talk to you about HB 251, which would be requiring children under the age of two to be restrained in a rear-facing car seat.

3090
05:43:40.500 --> 05:43:58.000
I'm going to keep this very short because we have a lot of speakers on this bill, and I ask if you have any pointed questions that you save them for the experts speaking next.

3091
05:43:58.000 --> 05:44:07.500
This bill is the same as last year that passed the House and got lost in the COVID mess.

3092
05:44:07.500 --> 05:44:19.500
The only difference is we have an amendment regarding the manufacturer laws that will help clear up any confusion that we had last year.

3093
05:44:19.500 --> 05:44:24.500
So essentially this bill would add protection for our children.

3094
05:44:24.500 --> 05:44:34.500
The American Academy of Pediatrics has expanded their car seat recommendations to keep children rear-facing for as long as possible.

3095
05:44:34.500 --> 05:44:38.500
They did this because it'll help save lives.

3096
05:44:38.500 --> 05:44:48.000
Every month that a child rides rear-facing gives them more time for the head and neck to fully develop.

3097
05:44:48.000 --> 05:45:00.500
A rear-facing car seat cradles a child's entire body, and it only takes one-fourth inch of a stretch for a child's spinal cord to rupture.

3098
05:45:00.500 --> 05:45:07.000
Using the correct car seat can decrease death or serious injury by 70%.

3099
05:45:07.000 --> 05:45:11.000
Currently, there is no language to protect infants.

3100
05:45:11.000 --> 05:45:18.500
My wife and I have a two-and-a-half-year-old that's still rear-facing, as well as a newborn.

3101
05:45:18.500 --> 05:45:27.500
I'm sure some of you parents know I couldn't believe how fragile and small a new child is.

3102
05:45:27.500 --> 05:45:37.000
And I can't fathom, nor do I want to, what would happen to them in a serious car crash.

3103
05:45:37.000 --> 05:45:40.500
So I thank you for your time.

3104
05:45:40.500 --> 05:45:45.000
And with that, I'll take any questions or, yeah.

3105
05:45:45.000 --> 05:45:47.000
Thank you, Representative.

3106
05:45:47.000 --> 05:45:49.000
And I was remiss.

3107
05:45:49.000 --> 05:45:51.000
Congratulations, by the way.

3108
05:45:51.000 --> 05:45:53.000
Thank you.

3109
05:45:53.000 --> 05:46:02.000
That's why I'm not on video, because I have very big bags under my eyes at the moment.

3110
05:46:02.000 --> 05:46:06.000
Any questions for Representative Fenton from the committee?

3111
05:46:06.000 --> 05:46:08.000
Seeing none.

3112
05:46:08.000 --> 05:46:10.000
Thank you, sir.

3113
05:46:10.000 --> 05:46:12.000
Thank you.

3114
05:46:12.000 --> 05:46:19.000
Chair recognizes, Dan Goodman from, no, yeah, looks like this was signed up incorrectly.

3115
05:46:19.000 --> 05:46:21.500
Anyway, Dan Goodman, chair recognizes.

3116
05:46:21.500 --> 05:46:23.500
Are you there, sir?

3117
05:46:23.500 --> 05:46:27.000
Says you're an elected official representing yourself.

3118
05:46:27.000 --> 05:46:31.500
So I don't believe that to be the case.

3119
05:46:31.500 --> 05:46:34.000
Yeah, that's not the case.

3120
05:46:34.000 --> 05:46:36.500
Can you hear me okay?

3121
05:46:36.500 --> 05:46:38.500
I can.

3122
05:46:38.500 --> 05:46:41.000
It's nice to be back.

3123
05:46:41.000 --> 05:46:43.000
Yeah.

3124
05:46:43.000 --> 05:46:52.500
And to clarify for the record, it's Dan Goodman, not representative, public affairs manager for AAA Northern New England.

3125
05:46:52.500 --> 05:46:56.500
And I'm speaking in support of the bill.

3126
05:46:56.500 --> 05:47:33.500
And know the company the committee is running behind so I'll be really really brief as representative Fenton said this bill protects the most vulnerable and the youngest more vehicle passengers beside the academy of pediatricians the national traffic safety administration all agree that children should ride rear-facing as long as possible and at least until two years of age or until they reach the weight or height limits of manufacturer of the seat.

3127
05:47:33.500 --> 05:47:44.500
There are a lot, a lot of studies out there that show that this will keep children much safer and more secure.

3128
05:47:44.500 --> 05:47:47.500
Happy to share any of them.

3129
05:47:47.500 --> 05:48:00.000
A University of Virginia study found that children were 75% less likely to suffer severe or fatal injuries in a crash if they were rear-facing.

3130
05:48:00.000 --> 05:48:05.000
Rear-facing seats are designed to support the children's fragile body.

3131
05:48:05.000 --> 05:48:22.000
I included in my testimony a link to a video simulation of an 18-month-old child in a rear-facing versus a forward-facing safety seat that was made by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute.

3132
05:48:22.000 --> 05:48:25.500
I really encourage you to watch it.

3133
05:48:25.500 --> 05:48:32.500
I have a 19-month-old daughter and a pregnant wife, and it's very, very shocking.

3134
05:48:32.500 --> 05:48:45.500
Under the existing RSA, there's no specific language to guide parents and caregivers on the appropriate type of child restraint used at various stages of development.

3135
05:48:45.500 --> 05:48:54.500
This legislation before you today will help close that gap in child pastor safety in New Hampshire's law.

3136
05:48:54.500 --> 05:48:58.000
So with that, I'll close my testimony.

3137
05:48:58.000 --> 05:49:01.500
Thank you for the time and consideration.

3138
05:49:01.500 --> 05:49:05.000
I'd be happy to answer any questions.

3139
05:49:05.000 --> 05:49:07.500
Any questions from the committee?

3140
05:49:07.500 --> 05:49:11.000
Seeing none, thank you for testimony, Mr.

3141
05:49:11.000 --> 05:49:13.000
Goodman.

3142
05:49:13.000 --> 05:49:15.000
Thank you.

3143
05:49:15.000 --> 05:49:18.500
Chair recognizes Cindy Tuttle representing Concord hospital.

3144
05:49:18.500 --> 05:49:20.500
Good afternoon, commissioner.

3145
05:49:20.500 --> 05:49:24.000
Is it possible to do video sharing?

3146
05:49:24.000 --> 05:49:26.000
Can you do that?

3147
05:49:26.000 --> 05:49:30.000
I'm going to go ahead and do that.

3148
05:49:30.000 --> 05:49:34.000
I'm going to go ahead and do that.

3149
05:49:34.000 --> 05:49:36.000
Good afternoon, Commissioner.

3150
05:49:36.000 --> 05:49:39.500
Is it possible to do video sharing?

3151
05:49:39.500 --> 05:49:42.500
Can you pull up my video?

3152
05:49:42.500 --> 05:49:47.000
If she clicks share screen, she can do it.

3153
05:49:47.000 --> 05:49:49.000
You did?

3154
05:49:49.000 --> 05:49:52.500
You just need to click share screen.

3155
05:49:52.500 --> 05:49:54.500
All right.

3156
05:49:54.500 --> 05:49:58.500
Oh, wait, like your video or your screen?

3157
05:49:58.500 --> 05:50:00.500
My screen, please.

3158
05:50:00.500 --> 05:50:02.500
Yeah, there you go.

3159
05:50:02.500 --> 05:50:04.500
Okay, great.

3160
05:50:04.500 --> 05:50:06.500
Thank you very much.

3161
05:50:06.500 --> 05:50:08.500
Hi, I'm Cindy Tuttle.

3162
05:50:08.500 --> 05:50:18.500
I am a nurse educator and nursing supervisor at Concord Hospital, representing Concord Hospital, and a child pastor safety instructor.

3163
05:50:18.500 --> 05:50:24.000
So thank you for the opportunity to testify for this bill.

3164
05:50:24.000 --> 05:50:33.000
I feel strongly encouraged by this bill simply because I see the day-to-day injury that occur with children.

3165
05:50:33.000 --> 05:50:41.500
In this seat here, I have a rear-facing infant seat, and this would be a forward-facing seat.

3166
05:50:41.500 --> 05:50:46.500
So facing you would be the front of the car.

3167
05:50:46.500 --> 05:51:05.500
And if that frontal crash would occur, which is about 70% of all crashes occur occur, the rear-facing infant seat would come toward you first and then up toward the back of the seat and then back down.

3168
05:51:05.500 --> 05:51:17.000
This child in this seat would be properly restrained and within the seat itself, protecting the head, the neck, and the spinal cord.

3169
05:51:17.000 --> 05:51:46.000
Unlike our child who would be rear-facing, forward facing seat would be facing the front of the vehicle and this child would be coming forward and you can see the potential for the stretching of the head and neck which Representative Fenton has already described and the potential for spinal cord injury with children that are forward facing.

3170
05:51:46.000 --> 05:51:58.500
So markedly different in our children and our one to two year old age group is certainly at risk if this bill is not passed.

3171
05:51:58.500 --> 05:52:03.500
So I do ask you for your support of this.

3172
05:52:03.500 --> 05:52:07.500
I would be glad to entertain any questions.

3173
05:52:07.500 --> 05:52:09.500
Question?

3174
05:52:09.500 --> 05:52:11.500
Recognizes?

3175
05:52:11.500 --> 05:52:13.500
Mr.

3176
05:52:13.500 --> 05:52:16.000
Chairman, we cannot hear you.

3177
05:52:16.000 --> 05:52:18.500
You can't hear me either?

3178
05:52:18.500 --> 05:52:20.500
Now we can.

3179
05:52:20.500 --> 05:52:24.500
It was some background noise from Cindy's computer.

3180
05:52:24.500 --> 05:52:28.000
Yeah, I don't know what's going on.

3181
05:52:28.000 --> 05:52:34.500
I just had something pop up on my screen a minute ago, too.

3182
05:52:34.500 --> 05:52:37.500
I couldn't get rid of that.

3183
05:52:37.500 --> 05:52:40.000
We're back to normal now.

3184
05:52:40.000 --> 05:52:42.500
The chair recognizes Tom Leach.

3185
05:52:42.500 --> 05:52:44.500
In support the bill.

3186
05:52:44.500 --> 05:52:46.500
Thank you, Mr.

3187
05:52:46.500 --> 05:52:48.500
Chairman.

3188
05:52:48.500 --> 05:52:54.500
Thank you, representatives for hearing discussion on this very important bill today.

3189
05:52:54.500 --> 05:52:59.500
I just want to make sure, can you hear me?

3190
05:52:59.500 --> 05:53:01.500
I can.

3191
05:53:01.500 --> 05:53:07.000
If you can just state your name and who you represent.

3192
05:53:07.000 --> 05:53:10.000
Yes, my name is Tom Leach.

3193
05:53:10.000 --> 05:53:14.000
I work for Chad Children's Hospital at Dartmouth-Hitchcock.

3194
05:53:14.000 --> 05:53:19.000
I am the New Hampshire State Child Passenger Safety Coordinator.

3195
05:53:19.000 --> 05:53:24.000
I work through the Office of Highway Safety as well.

3196
05:53:24.000 --> 05:53:27.000
And I'm here to discuss that.

3197
05:53:27.000 --> 05:53:39.000
Obviously, you heard from Cindy a minute ago, who's very knowledgeable in the biomechanics of it as far as injury goes and so on.

3198
05:53:39.000 --> 05:53:52.500
And you'll hear more testimony on that as well, because our youngest children are the most vulnerable when it comes to crashes and G-forces and so on.

3199
05:53:52.500 --> 05:53:57.500
New Hampshire has a pretty robust child passenger safety program.

3200
05:53:57.500 --> 05:54:14.500
I'm very proud to say we've got 224 certified technicians statewide, another 11 instructors, and 56 fitting stations throughout the state to help parents and caregivers figure out this complicated process of child seats.

3201
05:54:14.500 --> 05:54:27.000
And for those of you who have had children and have dealt with child seats, it can be a little overwhelming and a little confusing.

3202
05:54:27.000 --> 05:54:30.000
There's a lot of information there.

3203
05:54:30.000 --> 05:54:45.500
And we all know as average individuals, when there's a big instruction book on something, we tend to wing it first and then maybe go back to the instruction manual later.

3204
05:54:45.500 --> 05:55:05.000
Why this bill is so important is that this will add consistency to the best practice message that we put out, as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics in how best to care for these vulnerable young children.

3205
05:55:05.000 --> 05:55:09.000
It's very important that these kids remain rear-facing.

3206
05:55:09.000 --> 05:55:22.500
The obstacle that we have as as technicians in educating is that new parents want to see the faces of these beautiful little babies they now have.

3207
05:55:22.500 --> 05:55:24.500
And I understand that.

3208
05:55:24.500 --> 05:55:32.000
It's understandable that they would want to look at their baby in the rearview mirror.

3209
05:55:32.000 --> 05:55:39.000
However, that really makes those children extremely vulnerable in the event of a crash.

3210
05:55:39.000 --> 05:55:46.000
So the best practice is to keep kids rear facing as long as possible.

3211
05:55:46.000 --> 05:55:54.500
And there's a lot of good equipment out there now that will allow parents to do that.

3212
05:55:54.500 --> 05:56:01.000
As long as they know, they're expected to keep those kids rear facing.

3213
05:56:01.000 --> 05:56:46.500
There's child seats out there now that go rear facing up to anywhere between 40 and 50 pounds and are getting more and more common so that emphasizes the need to keep kids rear facing because the industry is changing to do that as well so i thank you very much for your consideration for this bill again i'm in favor of this bill i feel the children of new hampshire will benefit greatly from this bill and I would be happy to answer any questions for you at this time.

3214
05:56:46.500 --> 05:56:49.000
Any questions from the table?

3215
05:56:49.000 --> 05:56:51.500
Seeing none, thank you sir.

3216
05:56:51.500 --> 05:56:53.500
Thank you.

3217
05:56:53.500 --> 05:57:02.000
Before you do leave though, I've got two, I've got a Thomas Leach and a Tom Leach.

3218
05:57:02.000 --> 05:57:04.000
Could there be two?

3219
05:57:04.000 --> 05:57:08.000
Or did you maybe sign up twice inadvertently?

3220
05:57:08.000 --> 05:57:10.500
I guess I lost him.

3221
05:57:10.500 --> 05:57:14.500
Sorry, I removed him before you said that.

3222
05:57:14.500 --> 05:57:17.000
I just had him back.

3223
05:57:17.000 --> 05:57:21.000
Well, maybe you can help me out too.

3224
05:57:21.000 --> 05:57:25.000
I see two Tom Leaches on our sheet.

3225
05:57:25.000 --> 05:57:31.500
I just want to make sure I'm not ignoring them if I continue.

3226
05:57:31.500 --> 05:57:36.500
It's quite possible that there was a double sign up.

3227
05:57:36.500 --> 05:57:38.500
Sorry about that.

3228
05:57:38.500 --> 05:57:40.500
Yeah, I don't see.

3229
05:57:40.500 --> 05:57:45.500
Different email addresses, but that's why I wanted to clarify.

3230
05:57:45.500 --> 05:57:48.500
All right, we'll go with it.

3231
05:57:48.500 --> 05:57:50.500
Thank you, sir.

3232
05:57:50.500 --> 05:57:59.000
Chair recognizes Captain Haynes from the Department of Safety are in support of the Good afternoon, sir.

3233
05:57:59.000 --> 05:58:01.000
Good afternoon, Mr.

3234
05:58:01.000 --> 05:58:03.000
Chairman, members, representatives.

3235
05:58:03.000 --> 05:58:07.000
I'm not going to echo everything everybody said.

3236
05:58:07.000 --> 05:58:14.500
The Office of Highway Safety and Department of Safety are in support of this bill.

3237
05:58:14.500 --> 05:58:30.000
It is one of the primary goals of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to get more people in rear-facing seats and more people to buckle up all throughout the car.

3238
05:58:30.000 --> 05:58:51.000
So therefore, we just want to voice that we are really, really, really in support of this bill to ensure that the safety of our very young adults, our very young children, I should say, and infants are protected on our highways.

3239
05:58:51.000 --> 05:58:53.000
Thank you.

3240
05:58:53.000 --> 05:58:55.000
Thank you.

3241
05:58:55.000 --> 05:58:57.500
Any questions from the committee?

3242
05:58:57.500 --> 05:58:59.500
Seeing none.

3243
05:58:59.500 --> 05:59:01.500
Thank you, sir.

3244
05:59:01.500 --> 05:59:12.000
As we move our way down the list here, Chair recognizes Colella, representing Juvenile Product Manufacturers Association, opposed to the bill.

3245
05:59:12.000 --> 05:59:15.500
Can I get that first name again?

3246
05:59:15.500 --> 05:59:17.500
Sorry.

3247
05:59:17.500 --> 05:59:19.500
Joseph Colella.

3248
05:59:19.500 --> 05:59:22.500
I see him on the screen.

3249
05:59:22.500 --> 05:59:25.500
I see him on the attendance.

3250
05:59:25.500 --> 05:59:28.000
Yeah, I just promoted him.

3251
05:59:28.000 --> 05:59:30.000
Sorry about that.

3252
05:59:30.000 --> 05:59:32.000
Can you hear me?

3253
05:59:32.000 --> 05:59:34.500
Can you hear me now?

3254
05:59:34.500 --> 05:59:36.500
Good afternoon.

3255
05:59:36.500 --> 05:59:38.500
Good afternoon.

3256
05:59:38.500 --> 05:59:40.500
Strangely, my screen changed.

3257
05:59:40.500 --> 05:59:44.500
I do want to clarify before I start.

3258
05:59:44.500 --> 05:59:55.000
I'm Joe Colella, the director of child passenger safety for the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, that conceptually we support this bill.

3259
05:59:55.000 --> 05:59:58.000
I know I'm listed as opposition.

3260
05:59:58.000 --> 06:00:00.500
We support this bill conceptually.

3261
06:00:00.500 --> 06:00:05.000
Our concern is just about some of the wording.

3262
06:00:05.000 --> 06:00:26.000
And just to tell you how much I support it, I've been an instructor and have worked with some of your, with Tom Leach and with Cindy Tuttle for many years, trying to educate people on the importance of child passenger safety.

3263
06:00:26.000 --> 06:00:30.500
So today I'm representing the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.

3264
06:00:30.500 --> 06:00:38.000
We appreciate Chairman Walsh and Transportation Committee the opportunity to testify on House Bill 251.

3265
06:00:38.000 --> 06:00:53.500
We're a not-for-profit trade organization representing 95% of the prenatal to preschool industry, including the producers, the importers, and distributors of a broad range of child care articles, including car seats.

3266
06:00:53.500 --> 06:01:01.500
And we exist to advance the interests and the growth and the well-being of the industry.

3267
06:01:01.500 --> 06:01:19.000
As your committee considers the improved child occupant protection legislation for New Hampshire families, the JPMA would like to support the effort and to help assure consistency with the latest research and the current recommendations.

3268
06:01:19.000 --> 06:01:25.500
And I know you're already on that path because I've heard your testimony.

3269
06:01:25.500 --> 06:01:27.500
I've read your bill.

3270
06:01:27.500 --> 06:01:41.000
The updated policy statements from both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommend delaying transition to the next type of restraint.

3271
06:01:41.000 --> 06:01:54.000
So forward-facing for as long as possible based on the specific weight, height, and age limits in the manufacturer instructions for the specific car seat model.

3272
06:01:54.000 --> 06:02:05.000
And as Tom Leach already mentioned, we're seeing more car seats that are coming out that go to higher weights rear facing.

3273
06:02:05.000 --> 06:02:26.500
We generally support that expansion, but when you choose an age as the requirement, like age two is currently chosen, we have to consider that these are safety devices and that they're designed and tested to protect children within specified height and range.

3274
06:02:26.500 --> 06:02:31.500
I'm sorry, height and weight ranges when they're used correctly.

3275
06:02:31.500 --> 06:03:05.500
And for that reason, what we're strongly recommending is specifying that the child restraint manufacturer instructions for height, weight, age, and usage must be followed, and that the requirement not only be applied to children underage too, but that same requirement, the manufacturer's instructions for height, weight, age, and usage need to apply to all children, regardless of the type of restraint that they're that they're writing it.

3276
06:03:05.500 --> 06:03:26.500
To further assist with that, I, with our written testimony, I sent some model language that JPMA worked on with experts in the field that's already been endorsed by Safe Kids Worldwide and the Safe States Alliance because they agree with it.

3277
06:03:26.500 --> 06:03:38.000
And basically what it does is it takes the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations and converts them into what could be legislative requirements.

3278
06:03:38.000 --> 06:03:49.000
So that's our biggest concern is making sure that there's full deference to manufacturers instructions and the limitations of the specific models.

3279
06:03:49.000 --> 06:03:59.500
Also, separately, on the topic of New Hampshire child restraint legislation, I do want to take the opportunity to express J.P.

3280
06:03:59.500 --> 06:04:04.000
May's concern with a New Hampshire OHRV operations law.

3281
06:04:04.000 --> 06:04:07.000
of New Hampshire child restraint legislation.

3282
06:04:07.000 --> 06:04:24.500
I do wanna take the opportunity to express JPMA's concern with a New Hampshire OHRV operations law that improperly requires the child restraint certified for use in motor vehicles are used by OHRV child occupants.

3283
06:04:24.500 --> 06:04:29.000
Child restraint manufacturer instructions do not provide for that.

3284
06:04:29.000 --> 06:04:32.000
They do not authorize such use.

3285
06:04:32.000 --> 06:04:48.000
And we know that it's good intention that that's been done, but chowder strains and booster seats are designed and tested in accordance with federal regulations and not for the OHRV environment.

3286
06:04:48.000 --> 06:05:07.500
Unlike cars, vans, SUVs, and light trucks, OHRVs lack protective systems that include regulated attachment systems for attaching the car seat to the vehicle and other required safety features that supplement the protection offered by the car seat itself.

3287
06:05:07.500 --> 06:05:21.000
So we strongly recommend revising that law and eliminating the requirement for using conventional child restraints outside of their instructions, outside of what's allowed by their manufacturers.

3288
06:05:21.000 --> 06:05:34.000
So with that, I'll conclude and I'm happy to answer any questions at all on child restraint from the JPMA perspective or from an advocate perspective.

3289
06:05:34.000 --> 06:05:37.500
I've been an advocate for 26 years.

3290
06:05:37.500 --> 06:05:39.500
Thank you, sir.

3291
06:05:39.500 --> 06:05:47.000
Have you reached out to the prime sponsor possibly of some of these suggested changes?

3292
06:05:47.000 --> 06:06:04.000
I do remember when we dealt with this a few years ago, I think it was the height and weight versus the age that was the problem for us extending this to and under.

3293
06:06:04.000 --> 06:06:09.500
I think that's why we left it alone at the time.

3294
06:06:09.500 --> 06:06:15.500
So if there's some, without getting into today, if there's some suggestions.

3295
06:06:15.500 --> 06:06:20.500
Yeah, we did send a letter to the original sponsor.

3296
06:06:20.500 --> 06:06:24.000
And we were happy to further consult.

3297
06:06:24.000 --> 06:06:31.000
We also sent our model language to the original sponsor and to the committee.

3298
06:06:31.000 --> 06:06:33.000
I don't know.

3299
06:06:33.000 --> 06:06:35.000
Thank you, sir.

3300
06:06:35.000 --> 06:06:38.500
I do have a couple of questions.

3301
06:06:38.500 --> 06:06:40.500
One's from Representative Hill.

3302
06:06:40.500 --> 06:06:42.500
Thank you, Mr.

3303
06:06:42.500 --> 06:06:44.500
Chairman.

3304
06:06:44.500 --> 06:06:48.000
and thank you for taking my question.

3305
06:06:48.000 --> 06:06:59.000
I'm wondering if your organization has ever considered model legislation or supported the idea of school buses being fitted with rear-facing seats.

3306
06:06:59.000 --> 06:07:01.000
That's an interesting question.

3307
06:07:01.000 --> 06:07:06.500
At this point, our organization has not weighed in on that.

3308
06:07:06.500 --> 06:07:21.000
And that's primarily because at this point, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does not have systems in place that would allow for the attachment of rear-facing car seats.

3309
06:07:21.000 --> 06:07:34.500
But that is definitely something that we would look at as an organization in the most favorable light possible if there were such requirements for school buses.

3310
06:07:34.500 --> 06:07:36.500
Thank you.

3311
06:07:36.500 --> 06:07:38.500
Representative Sykes.

3312
06:07:38.500 --> 06:07:40.500
Thank you, Mr.

3313
06:07:40.500 --> 06:07:42.500
Chairman.

3314
06:07:42.500 --> 06:07:44.500
Thank you, Mr.

3315
06:07:44.500 --> 06:07:47.000
Kallala, for taking my question.

3316
06:07:47.000 --> 06:08:10.000
The concern or confusion that I'm having is how do we deal with manufacturers who may not belong to your association, who may develop seats that don't meet standards, and how do we then give parents guidance even when they buy, if you will, non-compliant seats?

3317
06:08:10.000 --> 06:08:12.500
And that's an excellent question.

3318
06:08:12.500 --> 06:08:26.000
First of all, all car seats that are certified for use as child restraints in the United States have to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No.

3319
06:08:26.000 --> 06:08:30.500
213, and that's through the Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

3320
06:08:30.500 --> 06:08:47.000
There are some non-compliant devices, some alternative designs that have been made, but your law, because it requires the ones that meet the federal standard, your current law, already disallows those car seats.

3321
06:08:47.000 --> 06:09:05.500
As far as membership goes, there are two or three car seat manufacturers, legitimate car seat manufacturers, that are not currently part of our organization, but they have to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 213.

3322
06:09:05.500 --> 06:09:09.500
So they still meet all of the requirements.

3323
06:09:09.500 --> 06:09:23.000
Again, the importance in this context is that the limitations for the height, weight, and ages set by the manufacturers can't be superseded by a state law.

3324
06:09:23.000 --> 06:09:32.000
It used to be, we could just say properly used, and that meant according to the manufacturer's instructions.

3325
06:09:32.000 --> 06:09:53.500
But as laws become rightfully more prescriptive, adding in an age minimum, then they have to also clarify that the car seat still has to be used the way it was designed to be used, the way it's been tested to be used.

3326
06:09:53.500 --> 06:09:58.500
So within specific weight ranges and age ranges, height ranges.

3327
06:09:58.500 --> 06:10:00.500
Does that make sense?

3328
06:10:00.500 --> 06:10:05.500
Well, I appreciate you taking a stab at the answer.

3329
06:10:05.500 --> 06:10:13.000
I'm not sure that it completely clarifies my puzzlement, but thank you for that attempt.

3330
06:10:13.000 --> 06:10:15.000
Okay.

3331
06:10:15.000 --> 06:10:17.000
Yeah.

3332
06:10:17.000 --> 06:10:22.000
Just to clarify, it's not JPMA that sets the standards.

3333
06:10:22.000 --> 06:10:27.000
Our members all meet the standards set forth by NHTSA.

3334
06:10:27.000 --> 06:10:35.500
And non-members who sell car seats in New Hampshire still have to meet those same NHTSA requirements.

3335
06:10:35.500 --> 06:10:39.000
The non-compliant seats are normally counterfeit seats.

3336
06:10:39.000 --> 06:10:41.500
They're coming from other countries.

3337
06:10:41.500 --> 06:10:46.000
And those do not necessarily meet the NHTSA standards.

3338
06:10:46.000 --> 06:10:55.500
And those would also not meet your law because your law specifies only car seats that meet the standards.

3339
06:10:55.500 --> 06:11:01.500
I guess my concern, I'm going to use, if I may, Mr.

3340
06:11:01.500 --> 06:11:03.500
Chairman, with a follow-up.

3341
06:11:03.500 --> 06:11:05.500
Thank you, sir.

3342
06:11:05.500 --> 06:11:10.000
Just as an analogy of what I'm struggling with.

3343
06:11:10.000 --> 06:11:14.500
So I spent decades being a fire prevention officer.

3344
06:11:14.500 --> 06:11:24.000
And every smoke detector manufactured in the United States legitimately comes with manufacturers guidelines on how to install them.

3345
06:11:24.000 --> 06:11:34.500
But people invariably look to the laws to know how they should do that and very rarely read the manufacturer's instructions.

3346
06:11:34.500 --> 06:11:43.500
And so I wonder if there isn't a dual role here that we need to be mindful of.

3347
06:11:43.500 --> 06:11:51.000
I don't expect you to respond to that, but that's where my thinking is going.

3348
06:11:51.000 --> 06:11:53.000
Yeah.

3349
06:11:53.000 --> 06:12:02.000
And I'm going to respond to it anyway, if you don't mind, if you give me 30 seconds.

3350
06:12:02.000 --> 06:12:12.500
We agree that there's definitely a role in state legislation for further prescribing and that age too, we fully support it.

3351
06:12:12.500 --> 06:12:19.000
We like that because there are car seat manufacturers that allow for it.

3352
06:12:19.000 --> 06:12:22.000
And biomechanically, rear facing is safer.

3353
06:12:22.000 --> 06:12:26.500
That's what all of the research is showing us.

3354
06:12:26.500 --> 06:12:28.500
So we appreciate that.

3355
06:12:28.500 --> 06:12:45.500
But you can't use a car seat that has a limit of 22 pounds on it for a 35 pound two-year-old and still expect it to perform adequately in the event of a crash.

3356
06:12:45.500 --> 06:12:54.500
You have to make sure you also follow the limitations put on that child restraint by the manufacturer.

3357
06:12:54.500 --> 06:12:57.000
Who was it designed for?

3358
06:12:57.000 --> 06:13:16.000
So yes, we agree that New Hampshire should pursue this rear-facing to age two, but specify in there, express in there that the manufacturer's instructions for weight, height, age, and usage must also be followed in that process.

3359
06:13:16.000 --> 06:13:24.000
You have to get the right car seat for your kid and the kid's size, basically.

3360
06:13:24.000 --> 06:13:26.000
Thank you very much.

3361
06:13:26.000 --> 06:13:28.000
Sure.

3362
06:13:28.000 --> 06:13:35.000
So that raises a question with me, so I'm going to take this one.

3363
06:13:35.000 --> 06:13:37.000
Okay.

3364
06:13:37.000 --> 06:13:40.000
You mentioned, that's a good question.

3365
06:13:40.000 --> 06:13:59.500
You just mentioned that there are certain seats that have certain weight limitations, and you think it's somehow legislatively possible for us to make sure that people are using the right seat for the right kid in each car.

3366
06:13:59.500 --> 06:14:11.500
Can you send us examples, possibly, of the different products and how they're rated, and just a little more information on the products themselves?

3367
06:14:11.500 --> 06:14:27.000
Yeah, there's an excellent resource list that I can point you to, and I can send you the link to it, But it's put out by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

3368
06:14:27.000 --> 06:14:31.000
And basically, it categorizes all rear-facing car seats.

3369
06:14:31.000 --> 06:14:39.500
And it tells you the height and the weight limits set by the manufacturer for each model.

3370
06:14:39.500 --> 06:14:44.500
Each model has its own height limits and weight limits.

3371
06:14:44.500 --> 06:14:53.000
Some of them start where the maximum weight of a child riding rear-facing could be 22 pounds.

3372
06:14:53.000 --> 06:15:03.000
And other ones, as Tom Leach mentioned, go all the way up to 50 pounds in that same rear-facing mode.

3373
06:15:03.000 --> 06:15:13.500
It's just a question of the materials and the designs and the testing that has been done on the specific model.

3374
06:15:13.500 --> 06:15:20.500
So I'd be happy to send you, if that's what would help you, Mr.

3375
06:15:20.500 --> 06:15:45.500
Chairman, the list of all the cars that there are and what their height and weight limits are, just so you can also include in your wording, as many other states have already done, that you have to follow the manufacturer's instructions in addition to the age that we've prescribed.

3376
06:15:45.500 --> 06:15:47.500
Thank you.

3377
06:15:47.500 --> 06:15:50.000
Send me what you can.

3378
06:15:50.000 --> 06:15:53.500
But you are certainly refreshing my memory.

3379
06:15:53.500 --> 06:15:55.500
Thank you for that.

3380
06:15:55.500 --> 06:15:59.000
Representative, I don't know who was first.

3381
06:15:59.000 --> 06:16:01.000
Representative Aaron.

3382
06:16:01.000 --> 06:16:04.000
Can you put my hand down?

3383
06:16:04.000 --> 06:16:06.000
I'm sorry.

3384
06:16:06.000 --> 06:16:08.500
Okay, there was a mistake.

3385
06:16:08.500 --> 06:16:10.500
Representative Talersky.

3386
06:16:10.500 --> 06:16:12.500
Thank you.

3387
06:16:12.500 --> 06:16:15.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

3388
06:16:15.000 --> 06:16:17.000
Chairman.

3389
06:16:17.000 --> 06:16:20.000
Thank you for taking my question.

3390
06:16:20.000 --> 06:16:27.500
I tracked down on my email the email from JPMA, which was sent January 29th.

3391
06:16:27.500 --> 06:16:36.500
So I think I had to go back and refresh my memory because it had been a while.

3392
06:16:36.500 --> 06:16:42.500
And I'm looking at your suggested verbiage here on what you recommend.

3393
06:16:42.500 --> 06:16:51.000
And it's quite extensive the way it goes through each age requirement and how you do it.

3394
06:16:51.000 --> 06:16:55.500
I'm curious, is this wording from a certain state?

3395
06:16:55.500 --> 06:16:58.000
Is this just a suggestion?

3396
06:16:58.000 --> 06:17:12.000
Or is there a state in particular who actually has nailed it and has the verbiage that you'd like to see in terms of the suggested manufacturer usage?

3397
06:17:12.000 --> 06:17:14.000
Excellent question.

3398
06:17:14.000 --> 06:17:26.500
The verbiage is actually because so many states moved since 2015, when the American Academy of Pediatrics first changed their recommendations to include age two.

3399
06:17:26.500 --> 06:17:32.500
there have been 16 states that have passed laws that require that.

3400
06:17:32.500 --> 06:17:54.000
And each one of those laws has its own way of doing that, some of them more effectively than others, so that they're representing not only the child needs and the overall desire, the concept of rear-facing longer, but also the manufacturer's instructions.

3401
06:17:54.000 --> 06:18:15.000
What we saw, And this was in consultation with the president of Safe Kids Worldwide and their staff, as an example, the director of the Safe States Alliance, we saw providing guidance to states of wording, model wording, could assist in that.

3402
06:18:15.000 --> 06:18:19.500
Right now, we're talking about changing your existing law.

3403
06:18:19.500 --> 06:18:26.500
So basically putting a band-aid or putting an extension onto your existing legal wording.

3404
06:18:26.500 --> 06:18:41.000
The model law is if you saw a fit to actually replace your law, and it breaks down every age, it just takes the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations.

3405
06:18:41.000 --> 06:18:44.000
There's no editorial content in it.

3406
06:18:44.000 --> 06:18:54.500
It takes the American Academy of Pediatrics and puts it in a form that could be enforceable requirements for state legislation.

3407
06:18:54.500 --> 06:19:06.000
And that's why we worked with leading advocate organizations like Safe Kids Worldwide and Safe States Alliance to come up with it jointly.

3408
06:19:06.000 --> 06:19:20.500
The closest state that has passed something close to it, there's one slight difference because it happened during the drafting of the wording that you're looking at, is Louisiana.

3409
06:19:20.500 --> 06:19:24.500
That's the closest to having the prescriptive wording.

3410
06:19:24.500 --> 06:19:29.500
They passed it in, I believe, in June of 2019.

3411
06:19:29.500 --> 06:19:35.000
So it's not exact, but it's very close in the requirements.

3412
06:19:35.000 --> 06:19:54.000
We've, most states that we deal with, that we, that we work with are really looking at that, taking the existing legislation and making a couple of changes to it, as opposed to replacing it with model wording.

3413
06:19:54.000 --> 06:20:01.000
So it's really a question of what your committee desires to do with it.

3414
06:20:01.000 --> 06:20:15.500
If you want to replace your entire law, that wording would be more representative of the current recommendations than just making slight changes, slight modifications to your existing law.

3415
06:20:15.500 --> 06:20:17.500
Does that make sense?

3416
06:20:17.500 --> 06:20:19.500
Thank you.

3417
06:20:19.500 --> 06:20:22.000
Yes, thank you very much.

3418
06:20:22.000 --> 06:20:24.500
Further questions from the committee?

3419
06:20:24.500 --> 06:20:26.500
See none.

3420
06:20:26.500 --> 06:20:28.500
Thank you, sir.

3421
06:20:28.500 --> 06:20:31.000
Okay, thank you very much.

3422
06:20:31.000 --> 06:20:33.500
Further questions from the committee?

3423
06:20:33.500 --> 06:20:36.000
Seeing none, thank you, sir.

3424
06:20:36.000 --> 06:20:38.000
Okay, thank you.

3425
06:20:38.000 --> 06:20:43.000
That's everybody I've got signed up in advance to speak.

3426
06:20:43.000 --> 06:20:47.500
Who do we have in the queue, Representative O'Hara?

3427
06:20:47.500 --> 06:20:52.500
The sponsor of the bill has his hand up again.

3428
06:20:52.500 --> 06:20:54.500
Excuse me?

3429
06:20:54.500 --> 06:20:57.500
The sponsor has his hand up.

3430
06:20:57.500 --> 06:20:59.500
Oh, as a question?

3431
06:20:59.500 --> 06:21:03.000
Representative Donovan Benton has his hand up.

3432
06:21:03.000 --> 06:21:05.000
Let's see it.

3433
06:21:05.000 --> 06:21:10.000
Do we still have, was it for the previous speaker?

3434
06:21:10.000 --> 06:21:12.000
I'm still here.

3435
06:21:12.000 --> 06:21:14.000
Okay.

3436
06:21:14.000 --> 06:21:18.500
How come I don't have him on my screen?

3437
06:21:18.500 --> 06:21:22.000
I just added Ben as a analyst.

3438
06:21:22.000 --> 06:21:24.000
Can you hear me?

3439
06:21:24.000 --> 06:21:26.000
Okay.

3440
06:21:26.000 --> 06:21:29.000
You had a question for Mr.

3441
06:21:29.000 --> 06:21:31.000
Colella?

3442
06:21:31.000 --> 06:21:34.000
I just wanted to let Mr.

3443
06:21:34.000 --> 06:21:38.000
Colella know that I did see his recommendation.

3444
06:21:38.000 --> 06:21:43.000
Actually, I just forwarded him the amendment for the bill.

3445
06:21:43.000 --> 06:21:52.500
I just had received it today, so he should have that in his inbox about the manufacturer laws amended.

3446
06:21:52.500 --> 06:21:57.000
So I just want to let him know that.

3447
06:21:57.000 --> 06:21:59.000
Oh, thank you.

3448
06:21:59.000 --> 06:22:01.000
Appreciate that.

3449
06:22:01.000 --> 06:22:06.500
I will look at it as soon as we get off.

3450
06:22:06.500 --> 06:22:08.500
Okay.

3451
06:22:08.500 --> 06:22:10.500
Thank you again, sir.

3452
06:22:10.500 --> 06:22:12.500
Pleasure.

3453
06:22:12.500 --> 06:22:14.500
Thank you.

3454
06:22:14.500 --> 06:22:41.500
We have anybody else with their hands raised mr see any on my screen i am seeing none okay okay um what we have these numbers are only inclusive of who signed up in advance as it turns out for this bill they're pretty accurate in support of the bill signed up in advance.

3455
06:22:41.500 --> 06:22:46.500
As it turns out for this bill, they're pretty accurate.

3456
06:22:46.500 --> 06:22:54.000
In support of the bill, signed up in advance, including the people that spoke, 58.

3457
06:22:54.000 --> 06:22:56.000
Opposed, three.

3458
06:22:56.000 --> 06:23:03.500
And again, all these records are available if you need to see them later on.

3459
06:23:03.500 --> 06:23:09.000
With that, I'll close the public hearing on House Bill 251.

3460
06:23:09.000 --> 06:23:13.000
Just a couple of notes before we go.

3461
06:23:13.000 --> 06:23:15.000
I wanna thank everybody.

3462
06:23:15.000 --> 06:23:19.000
We're actually moving right along through our bills.

3463
06:23:19.000 --> 06:23:28.000
There were, like I said earlier, a couple I was hoping to exec today, but no big deal.

3464
06:23:28.000 --> 06:23:33.000
We're gonna have plenty of time in the following weeks.

3465
06:23:33.000 --> 06:23:38.500
Next week, I don't know if you've seen the calendar yet.

3466
06:23:38.500 --> 06:23:50.500
I scheduled a pretty healthy morning with some good bills and an afternoon full of exec session, which will get us somewhat caught up.

3467
06:23:50.500 --> 06:23:55.000
We won't get all of them, but getting closer.

3468
06:23:55.000 --> 06:24:00.500
The following week, I have not been able to schedule yet.

3469
06:24:00.500 --> 06:24:12.000
I'm still waiting to get my day, but I'm actually going to be seeking a second day for next week, the following week.

3470
06:24:12.000 --> 06:24:22.000
I still want to make sure that we dispose of all our bills comfortably before the deadline of March 11th.

3471
06:24:22.000 --> 06:24:30.000
So as soon as I know if that's a possibility, I will let you all know.

3472
06:24:30.000 --> 06:24:38.500
I just want to give you an early heads up that we actually kind of have to.

3473
06:24:38.500 --> 06:24:45.500
We've got 32 bills to take care of in a short amount of time.

3474
06:24:45.500 --> 06:24:52.000
So it's not unusual to see a second day once in a while.

3475
06:24:52.000 --> 06:24:54.000
Thank you.

3476
06:24:54.000 --> 06:24:56.500
actually kind of have to.

3477
06:24:56.500 --> 06:25:03.000
We're 32 bills to take care of in a short amount of time.

3478
06:25:03.000 --> 06:25:09.500
So it's not unusual to see a second day once in a while.

3479
06:25:09.500 --> 06:25:15.000
We're putting it up, but it's going to have to happen.

3480
06:25:15.000 --> 06:25:20.500
Any questions from the committee for the good of the cause?

3481
06:25:20.500 --> 06:25:22.500
Representative Lennie.

3482
06:25:22.500 --> 06:25:25.500
I'm just looking at the calendar.

3483
06:25:25.500 --> 06:25:31.000
So our next day that's scheduled is next Friday the 19th.

3484
06:25:31.000 --> 06:25:36.500
The following week we're in session the 24th and the 25th.

3485
06:25:36.500 --> 06:25:44.000
So are you saying you want to meet that week two days, two extra days?

3486
06:25:44.000 --> 06:25:46.000
You're right, you're right.

3487
06:25:46.000 --> 06:25:48.000
So my apologies.

3488
06:25:48.000 --> 06:25:51.000
I was forgetting about session days.

3489
06:25:51.000 --> 06:25:53.000
You know what?

3490
06:25:53.000 --> 06:25:55.000
That's a great point.

3491
06:25:55.000 --> 06:26:03.000
After two days in session, let's see what even the Friday is going to look like.

3492
06:26:03.000 --> 06:26:43.000
There's good chance now looking at it that way that we just might wait until the following week and do a double day then again i can't do this in advance only because i don't get to create the schedule of the rooms but uh let me as soon as i know i'll let you all know thanks for bringing that point up thank you anybody else see none have a great afternoon thanks everybody I'll let you all know.

3493
06:26:43.000 --> 06:26:46.000
Thanks for bringing that point up.

3494
06:26:46.000 --> 06:26:48.000
Thank you.

3495
06:26:48.000 --> 06:26:50.000
Anybody else?

3496
06:26:50.000 --> 06:26:53.000
