00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
all right our first bill
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
that we're going to consider is hb 340
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
which is has to do with the designation
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
of open containers
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
on uh in municipal lands
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to at this point
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
recognize the sponsor that bill
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative van
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
so i'm actually here to ask the
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much instantly
 
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
itl this bill after i put it in because
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh during the coveted times my town
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
peterborough was struggling with how to
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
help local restaurants
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of pushback
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
from the code officer and from various
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
public officials about well we couldn't
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
do this and we can't do that and we
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
can't do this other thing because
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
you know it violates the open container
 
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.590 align:start position:0%
you know it violates the open container
law

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
so i thought okay well let's
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
let's offer a fix
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
with the help of the um office of the
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know the drafting office i put this
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
bill together but friday i got a call
 
00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:55.430 align:start position:0%
bill together but friday i got a call
from

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.310 align:start position:0%

the

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%

for sorry for the liquor commission and
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
the lawyer for the liquor commission
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
told me that actually towns and cities
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
and every jurisdiction already has the
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
ability to do what i was attempting to
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
do with this bill therefore the bill is
 
00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.550 align:start position:0%
do with this bill therefore the bill is
redundant

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
and i would like to ask the committee to
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
vote it and expedient to legislate

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.150 align:start position:0%
this is uh representative silber from
belknap2

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
belknap2
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh there's some co-sponsors
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh from several uh from a couple of
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
different districts including bellap2
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
the issue here is
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
one dealing with the budgeting process
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
that takes place
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
in the counties
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
the schools the towns the cities
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
i've been chair of the budget committee
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
in my town for a while in the past
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
we just finished doing the budget in
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
belknap county by the delegation
 
00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.669 align:start position:0%
belknap county by the delegation
so

00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
i apologize for going through things
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
which many members of the committee if
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
not all might already know but i think
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
you need to take this all in context
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue administration
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
promulgates a chart of accounts that's
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
used by all the different entities that
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
has numerous general ledger accounts
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
and they use these general ledger
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
accounts to keep track of
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
not only expenditures but budgeting
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
items for each of each category of
 
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.270 align:start position:0%
items for each of each category of
expenditures

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
so what happens is in the budgeting
 
00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:43.029 align:start position:0%
so what happens is in the budgeting
process

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
depending upon what which entity is
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
involved whether it's the county the
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
county commissioners produce a proposed
 
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.549 align:start position:0%
county commissioners produce a proposed
budget

00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
in the schools the school board produces
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
a proposed budget in sb2 towns
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
the budget committee produces a proposed
 
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.549 align:start position:0%
the budget committee produces a proposed
budget

00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
in other cities other other bodies may
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
produce a proposed budget in which
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
these numerous and sometimes in the
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
hundreds of line items general ledger
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
line items are shown in the budget and
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
they're up for approval in the case of
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
the county budget it has to be voted in
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
by the county delegation or convention
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
which just happened in belmont in the
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
case of the school boards and the towns
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
in sb2 towns they're presented as
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
warrant articles that are voted on by
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
the tax the voters in the towns and in
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
ins i
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
assume in some cities there the adoption
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
of the proposed budget is by
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
selectmen or whatever the board happens
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
to be called in the town
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
many times during the process of going
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
through the different budget items which
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
would have having all the requests
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
a determination is made
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
that a particular line item should be
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
zeroed out
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
and that means that nothing should be
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
spent in that particular category
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
so then the budget goes for approval
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
the budget is approved showing some line
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
items one or more line items with zero
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
in there and that's the budget that is
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
then adopted
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
then what happens is the particular
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
group whether it's the county the
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
schools the town
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
has to report on the adopted budget to
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
the dra and they use the forms that are
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
commonly known as the ms forms and the
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
ms forms report
 
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.310 align:start position:0%
ms forms report
by

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
conglomerating a lot of these individual
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
line items into a smaller number of
 
00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:38.390 align:start position:0%
line items into a smaller number of
entry

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
entry
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
lines on the ms forms so the ms forms
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
presently do not show the full detail of
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
the budget that has been approved by the
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
voters or the governing body
 
00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:50.710 align:start position:0%
voters or the governing body
so

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
what we found happens is and after i
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
consulted with someone a staff at the
 
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.870 align:start position:0%
consulted with someone a staff at the
dra

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
dra
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
is that they take the position that
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
even though an individual general ledger
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
line item has been zeroed out in the
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
approved budget approved by the
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayers by the the voters
 
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.669 align:start position:0%
taxpayers by the the voters
that

00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
the governing body still has the
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
authority to make transfers
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
into that road line item
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
as long as the total does not exceed the
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
total shown in that particular master
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
line on the ms forms
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
so what it means is that transfers can
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
be made into a line item
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
even though it's you know been prohibi
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
essentially prohibited by the voters so
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
the dra doesn't have the full story on
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
the ms forms so what this build does is
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
in three parts deals with this issue in
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
three parts
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
the first is requiring that in a as a
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
supplement to the ms forms
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
the reporting body
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
sends in a schedule of all of the
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
general ledger line items that have been
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
zeroed out and that's a supplement or
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
addendum to the ms form so the dra has
 
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.470 align:start position:0%
addendum to the ms form so the dra has
it

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
the second aspect of the bill is that it
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
expressly prohibits transfers
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
into line items that were in those in
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
general ledger line lines that were
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
zeroed out
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the third is an enforcement
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
mechanism which basically gives
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to challenge if a a transfer
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
has been made into a zeroed out line
 
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.390 align:start position:0%
has been made into a zeroed out line
item

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
it gives an enforcement mechanism to get
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
that money put back and to basically
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
prohibit a future action
 
00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:33.110 align:start position:0%
prohibit a future action
now

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
what i found in working on the budget
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
committee for several years in my town
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
the way to deal with the issue is if you
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
in your in the wisdom of the the budget
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
committee or the delegation
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
wants to preserve the right for the
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
governing body to transfer funds into a
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
line item that has little or nothing in
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
it as opposed to zero
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
we would put in a dollar as a we called
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
it a placeholder
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
so once that line item has a dollar in
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
it you can now make a transfer and
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
that's there's no problem because the
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
voters have approved the budget
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
containing that line item with a
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
placeholder in it with the full
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge that transfers can be made but
 
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.310 align:start position:0%
knowledge that transfers can be made but
to

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
make a transfer into a line item with
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
zero in there
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
is really contrary to what the voters
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
have approved
 
00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.070 align:start position:0%
have approved
so

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.870 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
basically you know there's going to be
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
some opposition i'm sure there'll be
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
people who support it and there's going
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
to be people who oppose this and the
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
question i ask myself is why would
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
someone why would anyone or an
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
organization oppose this well people
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
would oppose this because they want the
 
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.350 align:start position:0%
would oppose this because they want the
ability

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
ability
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
to override what the voters have said
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
in their
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
approval of a budget with a zero line
 
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.950 align:start position:0%
approval of a budget with a zero line
item

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
on a particular topic or particular area
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
of expenditure so what this does it
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
gives full transparency and full effect
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
to the votes to approve the budget by
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
the voters
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
will you be able to stay with us for the
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%

okay what i'm gonna do is is uh
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
is ask a couple of more people who are
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
who have asked to speak to speak and
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
then we'll uh open it up for questions
 
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
for everybody is that okay with you
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
and by the way i i did put on a tie and
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
a code today but even though i'm not on
 
00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.350 align:start position:0%
a code today but even though i'm not on

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.870 align:start position:0%
very nice thank you so much
uh

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
next i'm going to uh recognize someone
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
who opposes the bill
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
and uh that will be justin campo
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go to after that becky
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
benvenuti and skip murphy i'll ask all
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
three of you to limit your testimony to
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
four minutes i know
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
skip you've asked for 10 but i'm gonna
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
hold you
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
to four
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
justin campbell you're up
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
hello can everyone hear me
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
yep you're good perfect
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to thank you for allowing me
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
this time to discuss this bill i am in
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
opposition of the bill
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
um as you're well aware a budget is a
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
financial plan of what the municipality
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
intends to do
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
i believe if this bill would be voted
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
into law that would end up backfiring on
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
the purpose that's intended to do with
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
we plan our budget months before it
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
actually goes into place and unlike the
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
private sector if something were to
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
happen that caused a shift
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
required a shift we would not have the
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
ability to do so i would say it was
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
voted by the public
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
speaking right now from this webcam is a
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
perfect example this time last year
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
there was zero thought about purchasing
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
webcams and laptops for town employees
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.669 align:start position:0%
in order to
maintain

00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
the town hall during the uh pandemic
 
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.669 align:start position:0%
the town hall during the uh pandemic
operation

00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
um yet a worldwide pandemic hit and it
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
becomes a requirement if this bill were
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
to take place i would be looking at a
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
personal fine for doing what is best for
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
my taxpayers my job as a finance
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
director for the town of wandery is to
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
protect the people's tax dollars and be
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
as transparent as possible by showing
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
them where their money is spent
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
i believe in keeping historically
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
accurate expense records so it can
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
reflect the future budgets and be used
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
to plan where the tax dollars need to be
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
spent this bill doesn't reflect this and
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
i believe instead request expense be
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
hidden by charging them to inaccurate
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
accounts which is not fair to do to the
 
00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:24.630 align:start position:0%
accounts which is not fair to do to the
taxpayers

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
if passed my recommendation to my town
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
manager and town council was to budget
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
every single account line even if it has
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
not been used in years
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
at one dollar
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh and that to me is not transparent to
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers it doesn't reflect an
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
accurate budgeting document it makes it
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
less accurate and therefore less
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
transparent quaint and simple it goes
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
against my job my job is to be as
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
transparent as possible and show my
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers where their money is being
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
spent and this bill tells me to do
 
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.390 align:start position:0%
spent and this bill tells me to do
otherwise

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
if house bill 459
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
as if passed house bill 4059 implies it
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
is more important to remain within the
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
financial planning plan made over one
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
year earlier than to be transparent to
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
my taxpayers it is an attempt to take
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
control at the state level over local
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
governments and tie the hands of local
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
governments preventing them from doing
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
what is best for their taxpayers
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
this doesn't consider the actual
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
functionality and annual expenses that
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
occur in local governments
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
currently when there is a need to
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
transfer funding to the general ledger
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
with the zero balance the finance
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
department would be required to explain
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
the reasoning and purpose behind it
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
should this bill pass the expense will
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
be charged on account where it does not
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
belong the municipality will no longer
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
be keeping historically accurate records
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
rsa 3195b which allows municipalities to
 
00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:41.750 align:start position:0%
rsa 3195b which allows municipalities to
accept

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
accept
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
and expend unanticipated revenues will
 
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
become an irrelevant statue further
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
encouraging west transparency should
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
this pass
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
if a town is anticipating the funding
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
whether it be from grants rebates or
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
state aid
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
there if they're not anticipating it
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's minimal chance it'll be budgeted
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
for meaning the account line will be
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
zero this bill will not allow the town
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
to accept the funding as the account was
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
budgeted at zero dollars
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
instead the town has potentially added
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
to an inaccurate account or pass on the
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
funding hurting the taxpayers further
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
i'm asked to maintain a budget of well
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
over 40 million dollars will manage over
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars with minimal staff
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
as section 32 5 e3 states in inadvertent
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
error a simple accidental mistake that
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact the bottom line but
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
rather a single account line
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
in which londonderry's general fund
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
alone has approximately over a thousand
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
will result in a civil fine men exist
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
large amount of money with less than
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
three staff members no longer seems
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable and require additional staff
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
further burdening my taxpayers this bill
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
will inspire less transparency and place
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
a larger tax burden on my taxpayers
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
instead of encouraging expenses to be
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
charged to be
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
to instead of encouraging expenses to be
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
charged to appropriate accounts
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
please allow me my cuisinart myself and

budget committee uh was vice chair of
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
and for full disclosure i and
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
representative norm silber live in the
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
same town and we share the same concern
 
00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.389 align:start position:0%
same town and we share the same concern
while

00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
and i do have to address mr campos
 
00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.149 align:start position:0%
and i do have to address mr campos
testimony

00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
where he said that there is no way to
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
change things the budgetary law does
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
allow for
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
a town or city to go to court and ask
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
for a special meeting if such an
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
emergency such as the pandemic needing
 
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.310 align:start position:0%
emergency such as the pandemic needing
webcams

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
webcams
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
or any other kind of issue uh that might
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
arise in a particular town to seek and
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate additional money so the
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
nuance that i believe he left was that
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
well our hands are tight is is really
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
not so much
 
00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:09.510 align:start position:0%
not so much
um

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
budget budget members spent hundreds of
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
hours going through the budgets at a
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
general ledger line item basis meeting
 
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.510 align:start position:0%
general ledger line item basis meeting
with

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
all the departments in all of the
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
tax spending
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
governing bodies be it the school board
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
the town
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
selectmen or water district or what have
 
00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:32.710 align:start position:0%
selectmen or water district or what have
you

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of time and what we found
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh norm and i
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
is that basically transparency was
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
erased because when we would say this is
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
not something that the town's
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money should be spent on
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
because of the way that the ms forms are
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
created and dealt with
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
that purpose and that's a singular uh
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
word that has very much meaning in the
 
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.070 align:start position:0%
word that has very much meaning in the
process

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
that purpose if the voters approved to
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
do away with then the governing bodies
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
be they
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
town administrators finance directors
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
selectmen school board members what have
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
you basically override the
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
the will of the people and i think while
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
mr campo talked about it making his life
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
more difficult
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
i would urge this committee to think
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
about the voters who have said this is
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
how we wish to have our money spent
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
and this also this process uh which i
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
had designed
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
not only says here's the line items that
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
cannot have monies expended against them
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
also gives a budget committee who then
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
proposes you know gives their budget to
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
the voters to approve can also
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
put more money into a general line item
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
which then tells the governing bodies
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
the voters have decided to spend more on
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
this so it works both ways as well
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
but it really
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
really is um in my mind a way for more
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
transparency because the voters say we
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
will do this we won't do that and i know
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
that in my town
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
we have caught uh the finance directors
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
or the governing bodies blithely
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
spending money on things that were not
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
approved and i think that's wrong from
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
the voters standpoint
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
we also see a lot of money being moved
 
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.830 align:start position:0%
we also see a lot of money being moved
around

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
such that things that were not approved
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
were then
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
purchased anyways and i think that's
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's a wrong thing
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan matter this is
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
more of a technical fix
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
because of the the way that the ms forms
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
are have been written in our processes
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
representative silber said this is
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
simply trying to repair a gap in the
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
process because of the way those forms
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
have been done it's basically put a
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
small spreadsheet together here are the
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
general line item account numbers here's
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
the description for what that single
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
line purpose for spending was whether
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
it's for canine dog food or a brand new
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
fire engine or what have you
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
it keeps the governing bodies
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh from violating the will of the voters
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
and i think from my standpoint mr murphy
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
yes i'm done your time is up do you have
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
any final comments you want to make
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
i do well no i will leave it at that
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
pretty much norm uh representative norm
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
silver and i are on the same page on
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
that and i'm willing to address any
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
questions afterwards all right thank you
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
few more minutes when we get to the
 
00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:44.070 align:start position:0%
few more minutes when we get to the
questions

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%

the chart of accounts is structured but
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's not a static financial
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
organizational tool it's dynamic and
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
over time the chart of accounts is
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
tailored and refined to continuously
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
reflect and report the details of
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
evolving municipal operations and
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
services and justin gave great examples
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
this bill appears to target the use of
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
general ledger expense accounts but as
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
written this bill would prohibit the
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
creation of any new general ledger line
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
items which would include all asset
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
liability revenue and fund balance
 
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.430 align:start position:0%
liability revenue and fund balance
accounts

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to expenses municipal
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
budgets include revenues liabilities and
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
operating fund transfers
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
many times when the budget is created
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
there are a few line items which show a
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
zero balance because of the importance
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
in keeping that account open or
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
to show the previous year's actual
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
expenditure that was made in that
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
account in the budget document for
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
comparison comparison
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
interestingly as was mentioned some
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
accounting software show these accounts
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
with a one dollar balance in order to
 
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
keep the account open
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
under this bill it appears that any
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
accounts with a one dollar balance
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
rather than a zero would be unaffected
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
so that you know that may be the
 
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.069 align:start position:0%
so that you know that may be the
solution

00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to set up new general ledger
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
line items throughout the year is
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
important to properly classify and
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
provide transparency and i'd just like
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
to give you a couple of examples over
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
the last few years laser jet printers
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
were originally provided by the state to
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities when municipalities were
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
required to become state municipal motor
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle agents and they were used to
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
prevent print all motor vehicle forms
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
registrations titles state forms when
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
those printers reached their life
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
expectancy and began failing
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities were informed the state
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
would not replace them
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities found themselves mid-year
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
having to purchase these printers when
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
they were not budgeted
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
under this bill this expense would
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
likely qualify as an unforeseen expense
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
and the creation of a new general july
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
item would be allowed however before
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
doing this calling a special meeting
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
would be necessary
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
to appropriate additional money to the
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
budget rather than the governing body
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
simply being able to create the new
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
general ledger line item transfer and
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation from an unexpended balance
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
of another approved appropriation to
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
fund this expenditure in order not to
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
increase the budget
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
another example of a real problem that
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
could come out of this is a municipality
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
passes the budget and they don't think
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to need a tan so they put
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
zero down for interest in in the tan
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
line item something happens and they
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
need a tan they end up either not being
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
able to get a tan which is a taxi
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
anticipation no i'm sorry i shouldn't
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
have just assumed that um they might not
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
be able to get the tan because they are
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
prohibited from paying the interest or
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
they have to do it anyways and get fined
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
and taken to court
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
there's no time to call a special
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
meeting and request that additional
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
money be appropriated for the budget
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
which is of course the reason for
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
needing the tan in the first place
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
also when the bill refers to calling a
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
special meeting in an emergency we are
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
assuming it's talking about a special
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
town meeting not meal or selectmen's or
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
a council meeting and that calling that
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
special meeting to appropriate money
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
would require court approval so the town
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
would have to a spend money on a lawyer
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
b spend money for the cost of the town
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
meeting and c then appropriate
 
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate additional money all instead
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
of just moving an appropriation from one
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
line to another which wouldn't cost
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
anything so for all these reasons we
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that you vote hb
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
459 inexpedient to legislate thank you
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%

stavis at least that would like to ask
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
questions let me start with a
 
00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.670 align:start position:0%
questions let me start with a
distinguished

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
distinguished
 
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.710 align:start position:0%
distinguished
uh

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
i don't know who to direct this question
 
00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:22.790 align:start position:0%
i don't know who to direct this question
to

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to put it out there
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
there are two issues that i'm
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about here
 
00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:31.750 align:start position:0%
concerned about here
one

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
it seems that
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
individual members of a governing board
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
would be fined
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
and that there would be no recourse but
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
for them to pay it out of their own
 
00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.589 align:start position:0%
for them to pay it out of their own
pocket

00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
pocket
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
if they were found guilty
 
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.510 align:start position:0%
if they were found guilty
um

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's my first concern and my second is
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of of holding a special meeting
 
00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.750 align:start position:0%
the cost of of holding a special meeting
so

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
the initial the question about the
 
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.349 align:start position:0%
the initial the question about the
individual

00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
members being fined
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
would you think that this might have a
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on
 
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.430 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on
volunteer

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
board members in small communities i
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
know in hillsboro we have a hard enough
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
time finding um people to run for office
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
if they knew they might be fined a
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
certain amount of money they have to pay
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
out of their own pocket plus the cost of
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
court proceedings that they might be
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
concerned about that and not want to run
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
and the second is calling a special
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
meeting costs money and how does that
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
fit into this um this budgeting
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
snafu that we have here representative
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
silva you want to take a stab at that
 
00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:44.069 align:start position:0%
silva you want to take a stab at that
first

00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
i'm unmuted now right
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
you kidding me okay
 
00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:49.990 align:start position:0%
you kidding me okay
okay

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh i'll do it in reverse order uh the
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
concern about a special the expense of
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
having to call a special meeting
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
can normally be obviated by the fact
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
that most budgets
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
that are designed well
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
contingency fund
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
number a line item for a contingency
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
fund for unanticipated expenditures
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
so that would cover for example the
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
replacement of uh printers that there
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
have exceeded their life expectancy now
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
only if the contingency fund was not
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
adequate would there be a necessity for
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
calling a special meeting
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
as far as the personal liability of the
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh the people in the governing body
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
as being a chilling effect on their
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
ability to function
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's the enforcement mechanism is
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
designed to be a chilling effect on
 
00:41:41.839 --> 00:41:42.630 align:start position:0%
designed to be a chilling effect on
their

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
ability to ignore the will of the voters
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
as expressed in the budget so that if
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
they do not vote to transfer into a zero
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
line item that's been in approved budget
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
they have no liability but if they do
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
they know that they face the potential
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
for a citizen bringing an action to hold
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
them accountable for that so that's you
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
know that's the answer to those two
 
00:42:05.359 --> 00:42:06.309 align:start position:0%
know that's the answer to those two
questions

00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:42:06.319 --> 00:42:07.349 align:start position:0%
questions
okay

00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i'll give you
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh mr campbell one minute to offer
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
mr chair all right mr campo you still
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
all right ron he's uh getting his
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
computer uh squared away we'll go to uh
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.950 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
perfect

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
so uh with the contingency fund i'm
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
assuming we're talking about rsa 3198a
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh the town of londonderry currently
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that because we looked at
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
it and it allows you to do one percent
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
of the budget
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
we've been giving back or we've been
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
underexpending by about under one
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
percent so we didn't think it was fair
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
to over tax our taxpayers
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
as for holding a special meeting i guess
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
that that is an option you're absolutely
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
right but timing becomes an issue
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
several times especially looking at a
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic where
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
we are you know we had trouble getting
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
a special me we had trouble
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
with the current elections for the
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
primary and general where now we're
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
having a special meeting closer to the
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
start of the pandemic and we're spending
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
additional taxpayer money to be able to
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
reappropriate taxpayer money to me it
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
just seems like we're spending a lot of
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
to solve a problem that really fully
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
isn't there
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i understand the concern that's
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
there but in a case like this budgeting
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
one dollar across the board
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
to me that seems less transparent
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
next we have a question from
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
the committee representatives davis do
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
you have a question you'd like to
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
address anyone in particular
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
i do have a question and it's a kind of
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
in the weeds question and i think i'd
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
address this to representative silber
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at page two of the bill
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
um section
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
2 lines 24 through roughly 28 or 29
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
upon a good faith belief that a county
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
city town or other local government
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
entity has violated rsa 325d
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
any citizen of this state believing they
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
have been aggrieved so that's my
 
00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:29.589 align:start position:0%
have been aggrieved so that's my
question

00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
what is the burden
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
of evidence
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
on the aggrieved party here it seems to
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
me that this is a guilty until proved
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
innocent situation
 
00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.670 align:start position:0%
innocent situation
um

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
okay if you can hear me okay uh i
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
believe i'll give you the lawyer-like
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
answer which is that it's like any other
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
civil action because this is a civil
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
matter and it is the greater weight or
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
the preponderance of the evidence it is
 
00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.589 align:start position:0%
the preponderance of the evidence it is
not

00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
you go in there and the scale is evenly
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
balanced and the person claiming to be
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
agreed has to present evidence that a
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
violation has occurred the people who
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
are accused of doing that present
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
defense and if the scale tips one way or
 
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
the other that's the side that wins
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's the preponderance of the evidence
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
the greater weight of the evidence it's
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
a civil matter it's not it's not uh
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's not uh uh you know any
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
anything from the criminal law it's
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
basically a civil a civil matter and
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's the greater weight of the evidence
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you i'm ready to adjourn the
 
00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:36.230 align:start position:0%

that anyone would like to make
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
schedule to move to the next bill
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh but if someone on the committee has
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
some last comments they would like to
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
make or have a last question remember
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
this is our time to find out about the
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
bill not to not to argue or debate the
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
bill that we'll do that next week but uh
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%

please raise your hand and and we'll
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%

okay i'm gonna end the uh mr chair yeah
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
but mr silver raised his hand again i
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
don't know if he wanted to recognize him
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
okay representative silva you uh do you
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
want to speak some more on the bill
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
the only comment i would like to make is
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
that when i asked the legislative
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
services to draft the bill
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
i asked them to call the bill
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
what we have called it the people who

house bill 586
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative alexander who is a
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%

want to talk to this bill and it's
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
going to be very difficult to get
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
everybody in
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%

limit your time to two minutes each
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
and if you need more time please ask for
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
it and uh we'll see where we are at that
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
point so we'll start with uh
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh hi mr chair can you hear me i can yes
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay great um for the record my name is
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
representative alexander i represent
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county district 6 which is
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
the town of goffstown
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
this bill has been
 
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.109 align:start position:0%
this bill has been
submitted

00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
because we understand that housing and
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in the state is a
 
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.109 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in the state is a
problem

00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
this was a problem before kovid and i
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
think it still will be after
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
we got here because the governor
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
convened a housing task force in 2019
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
which aimed at solving the housing
 
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.910 align:start position:0%
which aimed at solving the housing
crisis

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
through different um different avenues
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
but they came up with policy
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations so fast forward
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
those policy recommendations were
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
submitted last year
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
um through two different bills and i
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
believe the governor alluded to those
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
two bills in the letter that he sent
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
this morning to the committee to
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
so this bill is a
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
this bill you've pretty much heard in
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee last year in municipal county
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
it was voted out of this committee um
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
in a positive way
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
let me be clear there's there's no
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
mandate in this bill and i want to go
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
through just a couple of the things that
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
this bill does to
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
solve the housing crisis in this state
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
so it directs office's strategic
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
initiative to develop a standard of
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
training materials to members of zoning
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
and planning boards free of charge
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
it um says that any fee on a development
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
applicant shall be published in a
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
location accessible to the public so
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
transparency of fees it streamlines the
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
approval and appeals process for
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
affordable housing development
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
it sets limits on how long the courts
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
that if if a decision was appealed by a
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
local planning or zoning board
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
um if a municipality allows increased
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
density or reduced lot size or expedited
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
approval of any procedural incentive for
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
housing with older persons the same
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
incentives must be offered for workforce
 
00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.230 align:start position:0%
incentives must be offered for workforce
housing

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
it expands the definition of workforce
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
housing from 60 to 100 percent
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
of the area median income to 60 to 120
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
percent of the area minimum income
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
it allows municipalities to um
 
00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.910 align:start position:0%
it allows municipalities to um
uh

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
allow for inclusionary zoning ordinances
 
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.750 align:start position:0%
allow for inclusionary zoning ordinances
um

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.790 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
that includes standards that don't
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
reduce the economic viability of
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
developments but do require or
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
but do allow for
 
00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.630 align:start position:0%
but do allow for
um

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry let me go back
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
um so it it allows for inclusionary
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances that include standards
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
that do not reduce the economic
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
viability of the development
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
and it establishes a housing champion
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
certification that's developed through
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
office of strategic initiatives and it
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
shall develop criteria for earning
 
00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.430 align:start position:0%
shall develop criteria for earning
certification

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
finance authority and we strongly
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
support this legislation and thank
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative alexander and other
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
for introducing it again this year
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing supports this
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
because it will help to make housing
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
development um
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
a little smoother at the local level and
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is really the issue at hand here
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason why
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh the governor's task force and now the
 
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
governor is is uh in support of this
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and was last year with house
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
bill 1629 and 1632.
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
we all recognize i think that we've got
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
a problem with the housing supply in new
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire and that has is having an
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
impact on housing prices and rental
 
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.390 align:start position:0%
impact on housing prices and rental
prices

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
prices
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
and the ability of employers to find and
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
keep people
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
there's a great article in last week's
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%

there's a extensive quotes from the ceo
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
of fox biosciences in londonderry and
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
salem uh tom taylor talks about the
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
difficulty of
 
00:53:35.599 --> 00:53:36.470 align:start position:0%
difficulty of
uh

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
getting and keeping people in his
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
company um because of in part because of
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
the housing supply this legislation does
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
a number of things as representative
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
alexander pointed out i'd like to focus
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
on a couple of them and i'm happy to
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions at any time mr
 
00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.309 align:start position:0%
take any questions at any time mr
chairman

00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
um first off the the provision on
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
inclusionary zoning this is on page two
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
lines 14 through 26.
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
right now new hampshire law allows
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities to adopt inclusionary
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
zoning as a provision in their zoning
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
ordinances which is
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
as defined under current new hampshire
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
law a voluntary inducement to get
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
developers to build affordable housing
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
a number of jurisdictions uh
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
allow municipalities to mandate such
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
development and this would allow
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities both eat or either to do
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
voluntary inclusionary zoning or
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
mandatory inclusion or inclusionary
 
00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
zoning with the caveat that if it is
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
mandatory it cannot be less economically
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
viable the development cannot be less
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
economically viable than it would be
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
without the inclusionary requirement and
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
this addresses one of the concerns
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
raised in a number of other
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions such as california vermont
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh florida and maryland where mandatory
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
inclusionary zoning is allowed but it
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
simply passes on the cost to the other
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
units in the development increasing
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
those prices uh this would require
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
essentially a municipality to do some
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
math if it were going to do mandatory
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
inclusionary zoning to figure out what
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
would make the project
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
equally viable um
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
another section this is also on page two
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
the requirement for written findings of
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
fact i do lots of land use law lectures
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the office of strategic
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
initiatives and the municipal
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
association and this is something i
 
00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.470 align:start position:0%
association and this is something i
always

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
say to the local board members you
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
really should be doing findings of fact
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
in every decision because it is your
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
instructions to we're reviewing court
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
this is why we made this decision
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
local boards are already required to do
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
a written notice of decision and this
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
could be embedded into that written
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
notice of decision
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple other changes here
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
i would say that uh on pages three
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
and four
 
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:55.990 align:start position:0%
and four
um

00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
mr frost this is the
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
darren dolan i would just ask that uh
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
you gotta wrap your comments in the next
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
30 seconds
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
um let me wrap it up then thank you mr
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
chairman for keeping a tight
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
time clock on this
 
00:56:10.319 --> 00:56:11.589 align:start position:0%
time clock on this
um

00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
the the provisions in this legislation
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
allow for a smoother process a more
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
transparent process one that is
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
will yield i think more
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
consistent outcomes at the local level
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
so that a developer going into the
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
process will have a better idea of what
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
the likely outcome is going to be and
 
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'll stop there
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
through uh some of the points that i saw
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
when i reviewed uh the language of this
 
00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.549 align:start position:0%
when i reviewed uh the language of this
bill

00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
i'm here testifying today as a concerned
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
resident and a contributor to a local uh
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
to local government i spent the last
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
five years engrossed in local planning
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
matters and zba cases
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
i've taken the office of strategic
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
initiatives training for planning board
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
members and presented many arguments at
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
local zba and planning board meetings
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
my involvement has allowed me to see the
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
disadvantage that local residents are
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
presented with when opposing well-funded
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
and legally represented developers at a
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
local board
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert by profession but my
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
experience provides me important insight
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
into this bill
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
i've reviewed the proposed language of
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
hb 586 and i find significant problems
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
with much of the language i've
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
identified 20 specific problems uh
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
problematic items and i've included
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
those in my written testimony i'm not
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
going to be able to touch on all them
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
today but i would appreciate if you go
 
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
back and review that
 
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
um today i'd like to highlight seven of
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
the most uh significant things that i
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
see in the bill
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
first uh we see allowing workforce
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
housing at the same the same density
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
benefits as housing for older persons
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to go through the list
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
and then i'll touch on the details the
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
second is allowing mandatory
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
requirements for the production of
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
workforce housing
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
adding time limits to planning and
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
zoning board actions
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
defining public use as
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
private land development
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
instantiating a mostly unelected board
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
with no representation from residents or
 
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.150 align:start position:0%
with no representation from residents or
municipalities

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh requiring zoning ordinances that
 
00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.190 align:start position:0%
uh requiring zoning ordinances that
enable

00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
enable
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh the planning board to waive local
 
00:59:11.119 --> 00:59:12.470 align:start position:0%
uh the planning board to waive local
requirements

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
and imposing costs on the butters just
 
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
to access the judicial system so i'll go
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
through these quickly so you can see
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
where i'm coming from on each one
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
so firstly is um
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
housing for older persons uh to receive
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
the same benefits at i'm sorry workforce
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
housing to receive the same benefits as
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
housing for older persons
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
this section overrides local zoning
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
ordinances which currently allow
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
retirement housing often at much greater
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
density than single-family homes
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
town residents carefully consider the
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
of allowing retirement homes at these
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
high densities
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
when they voted to include retirement
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
communities in their ordinance municipal
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
budgets are based on those calculations
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
it is well known that the most
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
the largest part of local taxes are
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
allotted to local schools and retirement
 
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.710 align:start position:0%
allotted to local schools and retirement
communities

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
retirement communities do not increase
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
those costs nearly as much as workforce
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
housing developments disagree but i know
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
long list that you're going through but
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask you to try to wrap it
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
in about a minute
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
can we fix the feedback there yeah
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
now okay
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
so that's dramatically changing the um
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
ordinance that voters specifically chose
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
for their towns next i want to go on to
 
01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:36.309 align:start position:0%
for their towns next i want to go on to
um

01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
requiring the production of workforce
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
housing now this is a fundamental change
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
here because this allows ordinance
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities to require workforce
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
housing to be developed previously it
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
was incentivized requiring it is is
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
basically telling a property owner how
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
they would manage or what profits they
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
could make from their own private
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
property and i think that's a
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
problematic place to go from a state
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
from the state uh
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
01:01:07.119 --> 01:01:08.390 align:start position:0%
point of view
imposing

01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
imposing
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
time limits on both planning board and
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
zoning boards this one here is
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
is particularly problematic
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh the bill removes the ability of the
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
planning board and the select board to
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
extend the duration of the review
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
of a development proposal and the
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
problem here is that when development
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
proposals come in
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
they vary widely they they're each
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
individual dependent on the land that
 
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
they're developing
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
and many of them you could get
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
developments for one single family home
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
two three of them or you could get
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
developments for hundreds of of units at
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
a time
 
01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.430 align:start position:0%
a time
so

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
it is important that the planning board
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
has the flexibility to increase those
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
time limits because the amount of
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
engineering work
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
to review a large development of 50 100
 
01:01:53.599 --> 01:01:54.549 align:start position:0%
to review a large development of 50 100
units

01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
units
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
it requires that extra time you cannot
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's not possible for someone to
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
carefully review all of the details in a
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
large proposal in the the fixed time
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
limits that this bill has taking those
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
abilities away from select boards
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
planning boards and zoning boards
 
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.510 align:start position:0%
planning boards and zoning boards
is

01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
guaranteed to result in poor decisions
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
due to lack of information and lack of
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
time to to do the right thing
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
is do you have enough time to be able to
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh stick around for the rest of the
 
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.270 align:start position:0%
uh stick around for the rest of the
meeting

01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
i do
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay because i'm going to move on
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
to a couple of
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
of committee members who have questions
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
and i know you have more you'd like to
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%

for
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
in support or
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
in opposition like the blue sheet if i

if you could uh
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
mention that that would be very helpful

thank you you have uh i have a list of
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
that we have

36 who signed up to support
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
11 have opposed
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
who else has that thank you
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have my hand up but i'm
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
really willing to yield my time to the
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
the others who have waited for vayne
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay could you did you put uh
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
patrick puti's hand down for me
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative maturi uh why don't you
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
go next and then we'll go to
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
representative lasalle's after you
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair my question i guess
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
to representative alexander i'm just
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
curious now that the housing appeals
 
01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.990 align:start position:0%
curious now that the housing appeals
board

01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
is in full effect now that we are in the
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
second year of the budget
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
is there any conflict in the areas where
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
appeals need to go to the superior court
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
with what we now know is available
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
through the housing appeals board
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative for asking
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
that question um i would say this bill
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
just provides a different avenue for
 
01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.029 align:start position:0%
just provides a different avenue for
appeal

01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
and it also i mean it would
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
it would just
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
shorten the time that decisions need to
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
be made so i believe for the if i check
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
my notes
 
01:04:47.599 --> 01:04:48.549 align:start position:0%
my notes
um

01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
for the superior court it's 120 days and
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
for the supreme court it's 90 days but
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
it would just provide a different avenue
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
should should a developer or somebody
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
else choose that avenue
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you secretary

uh

01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
under that under the age of 35 to
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
purchase a home in this field because

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.789 align:start position:0%
the homes are so expensive
so

01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%

i am a proud supporter of this i
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
identify the fact
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
and i i know that i might take some heat
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
within the community for supporting this
 
01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.230 align:start position:0%
within the community for supporting this
but

01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
i do
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
and i think it would uh move
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
our community as well as the state in
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%

01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
someone who may have testified before
 
01:07:48.319 --> 01:07:49.109 align:start position:0%

truncate your testimony in that way
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
rather than just repeating what others
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%

01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
organization lakes region community

developers is a non-profit
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%

community facilities throughout the
 
01:09:01.199 --> 01:09:02.309 align:start position:0%

and we are in support of this bill
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
one thing i would point out are you know
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
apart from your feelings on some of the
 
01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.829 align:start position:0%
apart from your feelings on some of the
regulatory

01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill i want to make sure
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
everyone takes a look at some of the
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
financial incentives that are also
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
included um
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of communities that are
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know very forward thinking and i
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
would say welcoming of affordable
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
housing and they have a rather limited
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
toolbox to use and so
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know we we work with the city of
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
laconia and many other towns in our
 
01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:37.910 align:start position:0%
laconia and many other towns in our
region

01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
region
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
several of whom are trying to help us
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
figure out how to build affordable
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
starter homes for first-time buyers and
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
there's virtually no toolbox for us to
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
use to do that right now in new
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i think one of the most
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
critical pieces of this bill from our
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
perspective has to do with the amending
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
the mending rsa
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
162-k which has to do with tax increment
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
financing districts
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
because enabling communities to use
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
tax increment financing for housing
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
development would be a game changer
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
often the reason why we cannot develop
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
affordable starter homes is because the
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
cost of the infrastructure
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
is just too much to get the water and
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
sewer to the site that we've
 
01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.310 align:start position:0%
sewer to the site that we've
selected

01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
selected
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
and so we just simply can't make the
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
project work so i really think this
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
aspect of the bill in particular could
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
be really impactful for those
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
communities that have already decided
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
they want more affordable housing and
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
are ready and willing and even
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
helping us find sites this would give
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
them a really powerful new tool in their
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
toolbox that they could use to build
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
that so i'll leave it at that and thank
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to speak good luck
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
with the rest of your hearing
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative gallagher do you have
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
um yes i do i was just
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
wondering um
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
if i could
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
get a quick clarification on the
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
distinction between age-restricted
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
housing and workforce housing and
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
how they're handled in this bill from
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
some of the um drafters of this bill
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
if if mr frost is still on the line i'd
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
ask you to see if he could handle that
 
01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.390 align:start position:0%
ask you to see if he could handle that
question

01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to mr chairman can you hear
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
me yes
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
great uh so representative gallagher
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question um the the these
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
are two different statutes that are in
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
play here
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh the elderly housing or age restricted
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
housing um is governed by rsa 354 a
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
colon 15 that is housing for older
 
01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:44.310 align:start position:0%
colon 15 that is housing for older
persons

01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
persons
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
and it is an exception
 
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
prohibition against age discrimination
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
so it allows for age discrimination
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
where a municipality or a
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
builder property owner is
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
is choosing to make a development a
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
property available for people who are
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
60 or 55 and older or 62 and older
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
depending upon the circumstances and
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
they vary slightly
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
so municipalities have used this to say
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
yes we'll give you a developer
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
additional density if you're going to do
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
age restriction which you are legally
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to do under that law and that is
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
so the state law matches um essentially
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
word for word federal law on on that
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
matter workforce housing is a new
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire statute in rsa 674 i think
 
01:12:35.199 --> 01:12:36.790 align:start position:0%
hampshire statute in rsa 674 i think
it's

01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
58 through
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
61 or 62
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
and was adopted in 2008 by the
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
legislature and it has a specific
 
01:12:44.239 --> 01:12:45.510 align:start position:0%
legislature and it has a specific
definition

01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
for what constitutes workforce housing
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
although that law says that every
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
municipality has to allow a reasonable
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
and realistic opportunity for the
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
development of workforce housing as
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
defined and it targets
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
property that is to be owned or to be
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
rented based upon the incomes of the
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
owner or the renter
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
it the objective there is to um
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
one to codify the existing case law but
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
also to put some additional meat on the
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
bones of what the the courts were saying
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
was the municipal responsibility so
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
there are these two different statutes
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh and what uh house bill 56586
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
on page two uh lines six through
 
01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.830 align:start position:0%
on page two uh lines six through
thirteen

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
thirteen
 
01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:36.790 align:start position:0%
thirteen
um

01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
it says if a municipality is allowing
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
additional density or other sorts of
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
inducements for property owners and
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
developers to do elderly housing
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
that's age restricted housing housing
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
for older persons as defined in 354 a15
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
then it must also allow the same sorts
 
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:56.630 align:start position:0%
then it must also allow the same sorts
of

01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
bonuses density inducements for
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
i hope that's responsive to your
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
next i'd like to
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
recognize representative porter and then
 
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to come back to the public
 
01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.630 align:start position:0%
we're going to come back to the public
uh

01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%

01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
mr penn case after representative porter
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um this question is
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
sort of for clarification and i'm going
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
to ask um ask it of representatives
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
alexander and ben frost
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
both of you have mentioned bills that
 
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
came through this committee um in the
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
past session
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
and but neither of you mentioned in your
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
comments that the bills that came
 
01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.470 align:start position:0%
comments that the bills that came
through

01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
were significantly amended
 
01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.830 align:start position:0%
were significantly amended
um

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
by this committee prior to their passage
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh make sure that
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
i am right in saying that
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
when those bills were amended that's the
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
amended version of the bill that we are
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
seeing now number one and number two
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that were expressed in the
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
hearings then were addressed in that
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
amendment so i'm asking you if you can
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
tell me yes that is exactly right or no
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
i am wrong in that
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
um representative porter thanks for
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
asking the question i would just say
 
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
you're exactly right in that the
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee went through amended um
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
addressed a lot of the significant
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
changes or made significant changes that
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
address concerns from last year um the
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
reason why this bill was resubmitted is
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
because of last year due to covid
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of bills
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
had to
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
get itled um because of the state of
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
emergency so that's why this bill was
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
resubmitted but it's the it's almost a
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
carbon copy of what you voted out of
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee last year
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative alexander and
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
next we're going to go to mr pinkasic
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%

01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
for allowing me the opportunity to speak
 
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
i live in hollis new hampshire erin and
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
pin kasich and i oppose the bill because
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
part of the reason we moved to hollis
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
was because we
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh we we value our property value
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
right and my concern is that high
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
density housing
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
in this town which is a farming
 
01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.229 align:start position:0%
in this town which is a farming
community

01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
will reduce our property value
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
significantly and i don't think that's
 
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
fair to the to the residents of this
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
town who moved here
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of the town staying the
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
way it is
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
and i'll stop with that and yield back
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%

a short time ago he had an additional
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%

going to start a little bit late on that
 
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
586 going overtime so again those who
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
are called upon to speak i would ask
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
that you try your best to to just hit
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
the high points but like i said we are
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
now in an overtime situation
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm next going to go through
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
chris carley
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh who is neutral on the bill that would
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%

just looking for the last name uh
c-a-r-l-e-y

01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
is he not with us uh not by the last
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
name but that could be because it's
 
01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.030 align:start position:0%
name but that could be because it's
noted

01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
noted
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%

good morning chairman dolan members of
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
the committee i assume that you can hear
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
me i will be very brief when this
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
legislation was proposed last year there
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
were some provisions in it that we
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
opposed but as representative porter has
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
pointed out and the sponsors have
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
pointed out um this bill this year's
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
bill shows the includes the amendments
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
that were put in last year that we were
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
happy with that we worked on with
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
various stakeholders and so we are
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
officially neutral on the bill the bill
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
does have some provisions too that i
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
think will be helpful to municipalities
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
certainly we are always supportive of
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
additional training uh resources and
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
support so that concludes my testimony
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%

oxford county maine but that is not as
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%

we we fully support this legislation um
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know it housing is a multi-faceted
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
issue facing our state and this brings
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
multiple tools to bear against that
 
01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.110 align:start position:0%
multiple tools to bear against that
issue

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
specifically for many of our communities
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns is that housing is
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
rapidly turning away from an issue of
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
just folks being able to get somewhere
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
to live
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
and is also rapidly turning into our
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
businesses not being able to keep their
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
doors open for lack of employees i've
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
spoken with many business owners in the
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
area who have
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
job offers have been turned down due to
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
lack of housing and that is not just you
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
know from restaurants and retail stores
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
that also comes from our hospital it
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
comes from our
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
our school administrative units um you
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
know we're having a hard time filling
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
positions um simply because there is
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
nowhere for people to live if they
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
should choose to take them um so you
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
know this is something that is starting
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
to become a
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
rapidly increasing economic issue in our
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
area and um and as a regard to that we
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
are fully in support of this bill thank
 
01:21:14.719 --> 01:21:15.669 align:start position:0%

provisions and i want to thank all of
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
the members of the legislature who are

01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
for me really very clearly is workforce
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%

01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
employers in the state of new hampshire
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
pretty much across the board
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
and deeply connected with that is our
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
ability to continue to recruit workforce
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
and bring workforce to the state of new
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we are in a competition
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
with other states across the northeast
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
for this purpose
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
um we have seen over the last few months
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
that a few years excuse me
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
great progress in that area the karshi
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
school has done over unh has done their
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
regular net migration
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
numbers and we continue to show strong
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
progress in younger populations coming
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire but the thing that we
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
need to remember is that the connection
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
to housing and the ability to find
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
housing for people that are going to be
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
needed to continue to grow the economy
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
and do it in a responsible way that
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
allows communities to make their own
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
decisions as to how they want to proceed
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
under this under these important issues
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
is uh is really reflected in this
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation and my department and i
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
personally strongly support this bill
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
and we stand ready to help the committee
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
work through any issues that they may
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
see here
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
but we really need to make the
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
connection between available and
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%

just the highlights of my testimony
as

01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative porter pointed out
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
the house bill 586 is really the result
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
of years of evaluation discussions and
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
compromise those of you who were part of
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
this committee last year of course
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
worked on the amendments for house bills
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
1629 1632 so what you have
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
um as a result of those discussion
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
and as you know commissioner caswell
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
just noted the governor's housing task
 
01:24:34.239 --> 01:24:35.110 align:start position:0%
just noted the governor's housing task
force

01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
force
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
pulled a lot of these proposals together
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
but these proposals have been also part
 
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
of prior study committees and
 
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
commissions such as
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
the study commission on barriers to
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
housing development housing we need
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholder recommendations the sb-43
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
commission on land density and many
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
others the list goes on
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
in many ways we could call this toolbox
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
build the low hanging fruit proposals
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
as um
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
developer carmen lorenz noted you know
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
opening up economic development programs
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
like tiffin 79e to affordable housing
 
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.030 align:start position:0%
like tiffin 79e to affordable housing
development

01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
just makes sense
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
and then there's the issue of there's an
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
unquestionable need the lack of
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
affordable housing has been called a
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
crisis by new hampshire business
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
magazine new hampshire business review
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
as well as other business publications
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
it's a high priority for workforce
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention and as we have
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
learned important social determinant of
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
our collective public health so uh we
 
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
urge you to move uh this bill along in
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
the process and thank you for your
 
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%

01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%

committee
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm here on behalf of the 7 000 realtors
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
across the state asking for you to
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
support hp 586. i know it's hard to
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
overstate the need for this legislation
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
housing inventory across the state is at
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
a historic low and we don't think people
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
recognize just how dire the situation
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
has become so i'm going to share some
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
statistics just five years ago in
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
january of 2016 new hampshire had over 7
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
500 residential properties for sale
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
today there are fewer than 1500 homes
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
for sale across the state
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
that's an 80 drop in inventory
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
in just five years
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
a healthy level of inventory in the
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
residential market is usually considered
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
to have four to five months of supply
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
this means that if all properties on the
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
market currently were to sell and
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
nothing new came on the market those
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
homes would be completely sold out in
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
four to five months
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
as of december 2020 just a couple months
 
01:26:59.110 --> 01:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
ago our inventory is a little over three
 
01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.070 align:start position:0%
ago our inventory is a little over three
weeks

01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
three weeks and everything would be gone
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
this means new hampshire families are
 
01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
being priced out of the market it's
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
simply supply and demand um supply is so
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
low in demand so high that prices are
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely skyrocketing the median sale
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
price for a single family home is 350
 
01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.790 align:start position:0%
price for a single family home is 350
dollars

01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
five years ago the median sale price was
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
two hundred and thirty thousand dollars
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's a fifty two percent increase in
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
just five years
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
the condo market's even worse with
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
prices doubling in just the past seven
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
years and in some instances the prices
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
are increasing by 16 from sale to sale
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
hb 586 is not a silver bullet but it's
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
an important step in the right direction
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
realtors can attest that the frustration
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
our clients are experiencing is very
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
real the tears many new hampshire
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
residents shed as they are outbid time
 
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
and again by people just as desperate to
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
find housing is all too real and
 
01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:57.830 align:start position:0%
find housing is all too real and
heartbreaking

01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
we all need to recognize the developable
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
you try to wrap about 30 seconds
 
01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.470 align:start position:0%
you try to wrap about 30 seconds
sure

01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
developable land in new hampshire is
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
finite if we allow development for over
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
55 housing that means less opportunity
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
for young workers so we need to keep our
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
economy moving forward
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
everyone plays a role in this so um
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%

director of stay work play and as
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative alexander mentioned we
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
are a statewide nonprofit whose mission
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
is to attract and retain more young
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
people here in the granite state and
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
that's uh very much a necessity as we
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
are the second oldest state in the
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
country with one of the lowest
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates even during the time
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
of covid and one of the biggest out
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
migration rates of uh of high school
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
graduates seeking a four-year degree so
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
long story short we need all the people
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
we can get in general all the young
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
people in particular
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
we did a big data collection about three
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
asking young people in new hampshire
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
what's what are the reasons you might
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
leave the number one reason that came
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
back that said that they might leave new
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire this is people between the
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
ages of 20 and 40 said lack of housing
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
that's affordable both on the rental end
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
of the uh spectrum and home ownership as
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
well we heard this again last year as we
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
went around the state as part of our
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
policy and pint series to nine regions
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
all across the state and again the
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
number one thing we heard was it's too
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
expensive to live here um especially you
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
know and leading uh cause being the cost
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
of housing and for young people of
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
course this you know it's expensive for
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
everybody but it's especially expensive
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the young people we need because a
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know they're younger earlier in
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
their careers making less money as you
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
might expect often we have one of the
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
als also too we have one of the highest
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
student debt loads um average in the
 
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.709 align:start position:0%
student debt loads um average in the
country

01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of a perfect storm and so
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
we are in full support of this bill and
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
looking at any ways to reduce housing
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
costs in new hampshire thank you

raised from
 
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
people who have joined a meeting that
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%

01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
um i support mandy i'm a plenty
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
consultant in the state
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
i haven't done a lot of work on
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
workforce housing and there's one
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
particular section
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
that i'm very concerned about uh in this
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
bill i support the issue of workforce
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
housing it's very vital to our economy
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
but section seven would amend the
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
workforce housing statute and increase
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
the wage the income criteria to 120
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
percent of area median income
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
this will drastically impact the
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
affordability of housing in the state in
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
a negative way for example right now in
 
01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.470 align:start position:0%
a negative way for example right now in
nashua

01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
um the income ratio is at 100 is 113 000
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
which means that an affordable home is
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
394 000
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
if we increase that to 120
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
income will increase to 136 000 and
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
obviously the price point of a home will
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
increase i don't see how
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to 120 is going to help our
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
economy um i urge the committee to amend
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
this back to 100 and not change that
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%

staff appointing staff in manchester

that gave me a full
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
binder of information but i know it's a
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
huge barrier to entry for young people

join these planning and zoning boards

the education and learning more about

these laws it's a barrier to entry so i
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
support this bill because of the the
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
training component and also because my

a down payment but there is nothing

available so we are renting for the
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
disabled future just because there's
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
almost no housing
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%

i have um on this bill is
um

01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
i understand that there's an amendment
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
changing the the days um to close the
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
books from 30 to 45. my question is
 
01:42:36.239 --> 01:42:37.590 align:start position:0%
books from 30 to 45. my question is
historically

01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that counties typically do
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
not take longer than 45 days to close
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative i can't talk about
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh other counties in carroll county uh
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
at this present time one of the reason
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
this bill was was
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
written was
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's no specific time limit that
 
01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
counties have to close their their books
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
and we've had problems in county where
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh we're just finishing up our 2019
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh audit
 
01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to put a little pressure
 
01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:18.790 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to put a little pressure
on

01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
when some of the counties get these
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
things done in a timely fashion and if
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
there's a problem
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
they can go to uh
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh d-a-e-r and ashford extension and the
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh as representative porter
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
question there is an amendment to this
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
to this bill and
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
you will be provided a copy of that
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
amendment to consider at the executive
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%

01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
want to adopt that amendment or not
 
01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay with that i'm going to close the
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
the session
 
01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
on hb
 
01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.950 align:start position:0%

record state rep pattern rockingham 19
 
01:44:41.199 --> 01:44:42.550 align:start position:0%
record state rep pattern rockingham 19
stratum

01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
stratum
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'm here to introduce house bill 164.
 
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
this pill uh was house bill 1104 last
 
01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:50.550 align:start position:0%
this pill uh was house bill 1104 last
year

01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
it passed this committee and anonymously
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
it passed the floor on consent calendar
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
and died to death with hundreds of other
 
01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
bills in the senate
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
the bill just wasn't taken up in the
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
senate last year along with hundreds of
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
other bills
 
01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
so basically this is the house position
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
what it does it makes a minor change
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
to rsa 41 colon 14-a
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
the last time this chapter was updated
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
was back in in 2008
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
so what the chapter does if a town
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
if a tom adapts what this provision
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
currently says
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
that the select board shall have the
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
authority to acquire or sell land
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
building or both however they first must
 
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.109 align:start position:0%
building or both however they first must
submit

01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
submit
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
any such proposal of acquisition or sale
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
to the planning board
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
or the conservation commission
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
which they were only have the ability to
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
review and comment to back to the select
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
board on
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
what happens next is that
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
there are two public hearings
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
must be held
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
before a vote now during that period
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
if if there are 50 signatures from
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
voters it can become a warrant article
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
and again this is an enabling
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
legislation the town has to adopt this
 
01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
legislation the town has to adopt this
provision

01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay and this is i'm talking about
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
current law now
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
so what does the bill do many times have
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
adopted this provision
 
01:46:20.639 --> 01:46:21.669 align:start position:0%
adopted this provision
uh

01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%

01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%

uh 41 11-a is the controlling statute
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
if they don't excuse me if they don't
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
adopt this provision the controlling
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.719 --> 01:46:40.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:42.629 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
in check in checking with the municipal
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
it is not clear how many towns have
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
adopted this this
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
provision uh but i have i did by the way
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
i did communicate with the uh the
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
municipal association this year i just
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
communicated over the weekend and they
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
they they have no position on the bill
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
just as they did last last
 
01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:08.629 align:start position:0%
just as they did last last
year

01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:47:08.639 --> 01:47:10.870 align:start position:0%
year
so

01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
so what what does this bill do it makes
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
two changes to rsa 41 14-8
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
it adds to demolition or disposal of
 
01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:20.790 align:start position:0%
it adds to demolition or disposal of
buildings

01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
to acquire or sell land or buildings
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
because

01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
why building what the reason why is that
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
buildings can be gotten rid of in many
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
ways that are not selling they can be
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
torn down
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
what it does is it adds to the provision
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
in addition to the planning board and
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
the conservation commission having to
 
01:47:45.119 --> 01:47:46.310 align:start position:0%
the conservation commission having to
say

01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
it adds
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
it adds only
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh the conservation commission
 
01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
to that list
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
and when the bill was in
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee last year uh representative i
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
see i see you there representative
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
gilman from exeter
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
she added in committee an amendment
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
to include
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
the historic districts as well
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
so that's what you see in this bill
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
which is the bill that the bill you see
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
informing you in front of you hasn't
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
changed that is the bill that passed on
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
the house floor last year
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
so that's what it does
 
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.430 align:start position:0%
so that's what it does
uh

01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
mr canada

testimony we just heard
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%

bromley did the uh did the job i would
 
01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
just like to add there are a few
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
examples of uh municipal buildings that
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
have been threatened or actually have
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
lost to demolition um
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
historic and you know historic buildings
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
that uh show the heritage of the
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
community and how it's grown over time
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
so this bill is is just a way to protect
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
that and give the public the opportunity
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
to say okay
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
we don't need to keep this or no i want
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
to keep this
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i this is a bill that i
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
have indications from those
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
testifying or wanting to testify there
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
is no opposition to this bill
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh among representatives or the public
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm considering heading towards and
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
executing this bill when we're done with
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
the testimony unless i hear opposition
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind next i'm going to
 
01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:54.830 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind next i'm going to
recognize

01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
and we have communicated with him on the
 
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
language it does appear to clarify the
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
question of the select board's authority
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
to demolish or otherwise dispose of
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%

representative of romney for
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative gilman do you do you feel
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
that that needs an amendment to uh
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
to line up the language there that was
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
that was a suggestion thank you mr chair
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
that was a suggestion that i made to
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative brownie because people
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
because towns are moving on to select
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
board instead of select men
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
um but uh i would
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know i no i have no objection to
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
leaving it as it is uh just
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
how many do you ever comment on that did
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
you want me to comment uh chair
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
right ahead
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah uh in most places we caught that
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
and we do have select board
 
01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:55.430 align:start position:0%
and we do have select board
uh

01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think the way it works is that once
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
the bill passes we could probably fix it
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
over in the senate
 
01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.270 align:start position:0%
over in the senate
or

01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll catch it because a lot
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
of these current statutes
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
that have selectable
 
01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:07.350 align:start position:0%
that have selectable
select

01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
select
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh selectmen
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
have are automatically being changed
 
01:54:14.070 --> 01:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
select board it's my understanding
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
right the other the other place to uh
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
change it would be when it goes to the
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
full house you can offer an amendment at
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
that point as well
 
01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:24.870 align:start position:0%
that point as well
right

01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
right we have a comment from
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative chip
 
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair if we're correcting things
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
and if you go to line four there's a
 
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
selection in console
 
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
so uh you might want to consider
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
changing that also
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
okay did you did uh representative
 
01:54:44.229 --> 01:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
romney did you hear that one as well
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
you might have to unmute yourself
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
um mr chair might i note that it it
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
seems to have been caught every place
 
01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.830 align:start position:0%
seems to have been caught every place
else

01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
selectmen was changed to select board it
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
seems to be it's those only those two
 
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.830 align:start position:0%
seems to be it's those only those two
spots

01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
spots
 
01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:04.870 align:start position:0%
spots
right

01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:08.870 align:start position:0%
of the bill
well

01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
i'd like to hear from the committee
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
would you be okay
 
01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:13.270 align:start position:0%
would you be okay
with

01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
accepting it with these
 
01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:15.910 align:start position:0%
accepting it with these
uh

01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
minor errors to execute now or would you
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
rather wait for an amendment
 
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
and then we can execute it next week
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%

01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:28.709 align:start position:0%
committee on that either one way or the
other

01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%

yes thank you mr chair my
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
question is not in regards to the
 
01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:43.669 align:start position:0%
question is not in regards to the
wording

01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
wording
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
this is to the prime sponsor was any
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
consideration paid attention which i'm
 
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
really glad to see that historic
 
01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:52.550 align:start position:0%
really glad to see that historic
preservation

01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
preservation
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
and uh restoration commission is also in
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
support of this there is a process of
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
getting approval from historic
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
resources natural and historic resources
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
that timeline can be as long as
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
18 to 24 months uh in new hampshire
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
there is no precedence in terms of how
 
01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719 align:start position:0%
long it takes is there any
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh attention paid to that to restore
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
old building before it's considered for
 
01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:29.109 align:start position:0%
old building before it's considered for
demolition

01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
demolition
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll admit that i'm not an expert
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
so i i can't really uh answer that
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
question i wish i could
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
um maybe someone on this committee knows
 
01:56:43.589 --> 01:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
better than i about that
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
this uh just to follow up uh mr chair
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
this is really good in terms of
 
01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:50.550 align:start position:0%
this is really good in terms of
um

01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
reducing the
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
carbon footprint in terms of net zero so
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
the process if there is an incentive the
 
01:56:59.199 --> 01:57:00.310 align:start position:0%
the process if there is an incentive the
process

01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
and i think if jennifer goodman can
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative mayman has her hand up
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
idiot my hand is up and the carpenters
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
are loud sorry i was just going to say
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
that in terms of the language i'd be
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
comfortable passing it on
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
and catch those language issues
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the senate i think that's safe to do
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
and i think there's an advantage to go
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
ahead and finishing this up today
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%

earlier

01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:47.679 align:start position:0%
two things one i'm in favor of passing
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
it with these two minor changes that we
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
can attack attack and change in the
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
senate and second in regards to
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%

regards to how long do buildings hang
around

01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
dover is a success story as far as sax
 
01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
is concerned we have just signed a deal
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
with a local developer mr chinberg and
 
01:58:09.149 --> 01:58:09.159 align:start position:0%
we will be
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
refurbishing and adding on to and
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
opening up our old county courthouse
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
which is on first and second street in
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
dover and that thing has been empty
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
forever and it's a gorgeous old dover
 
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
building so
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's almost like never say never keep
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
hoping keep waiting keep trying to find
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
the right partnership because we've got
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%

to charter schools
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
and whether demolition of any municipal
 
01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
buildings would also
 
01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:53.990 align:start position:0%
buildings would also
qualify

01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
and be something that could be offered
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
in your list of
 
02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
offerings to various organizations
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
whether it would be offered to the
 
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
department of education for the charter
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
school coordinator
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
well while i am
 
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
not an expert i i do uh
 
02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
understand that in the house we
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
typically have bills that deal with
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
single issues whereas the senate is more
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
apt to have what they call omnibus type
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
bills that will
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
clump together many issues under a
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
single bill so if if you were thinking
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
that this bill and a bill in another
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
committee could be combined that makes
 
02:00:34.639 --> 02:00:35.589 align:start position:0%
committee could be combined that makes
sense

02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
sense
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
it would be my uh thought that that
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
would that would be better accomplished
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the senate side
 
02:00:44.709 --> 02:00:44.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um what i was
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
referring to is
 
02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639 align:start position:0%
this would this would work in
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the other bill
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
the other bill is just merely talking
 
02:00:54.159 --> 02:00:55.109 align:start position:0%
the other bill is just merely talking
about

02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:00:55.119 --> 02:00:57.270 align:start position:0%
about
unused

02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
unused
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
school buildings this would be
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
expanding it to unused
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings of any kind
 
02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:07.189 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings of any kind
so

02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
they they actually do the same thing
 
02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i believe uh
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
the intent and i'm ready to be
 
02:01:16.950 --> 02:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
contradicted by
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
representative romney or representative
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
gilman i think the intent is
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings would it would also
 
02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:23.990 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings would it would also
include

02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
include
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh school buildings as well
 
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
that would be terrific if that's
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
included in in there i just didn't see
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh charter schools listed
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
along with all of the other
 
02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:38.390 align:start position:0%
along with all of the other
um

02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh going to the historical
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
commission and things like that um
 
02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
if if charter schools were included in
 
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
that listing that would be um then it
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
would work
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
symbiotically with the the bill in the
 
02:01:52.719 --> 02:01:54.070 align:start position:0%
symbiotically with the the bill in the
house

02:01:54.070 --> 02:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%

so i'm uh i'm still in the ultimate
representative

02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative porter yes please uh
 
02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
please continue
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm just trying to
 
02:02:33.270 --> 02:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
remember back to the testimony that we
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
heard last year when we heard this bill
 
02:02:38.709 --> 02:02:38.719 align:start position:0%
and my understanding was
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
this was um
 
02:02:44.070 --> 02:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
brought forward by a community who had
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
lost a lovely building um
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
it was a beautiful building and and
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
someone had donated to the town and
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
before anybody could really do anything
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
about it it was destroyed or sold or
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the thing was so i think that
 
02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
that was the impetus between between
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
behind this particular bill i might be
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
wrong and representative uh gilman and
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative abrami might
 
02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
just you know dissuade you of what i'm
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
saying but i think that was the goal of
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
this bill was to preserve these
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
buildings or give the community the
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
chance to preserve these buildings
 
02:03:15.679 --> 02:03:16.790 align:start position:0%
chance to preserve these buildings
before

02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
they were just automatically
 
02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:20.149 align:start position:0%
they were just automatically
destroyed

02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
destroyed
 
02:03:22.709 --> 02:03:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gilman
 
02:03:25.589 --> 02:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to uh back uh to
 
02:03:28.229 --> 02:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
respond to representative porter that
 
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
indeed that was the purpose of of this
 
02:03:31.990 --> 02:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill but also
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
to add we wanted to add in the historic
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
district commission and the heritage
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
commission because that aspect of a
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
building wasn't included and also the
 
02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
conservation commission
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't at least in my town doesn't deal
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
with buildings at all or just one um and
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
the city and the planning board
 
02:03:50.639 --> 02:03:51.669 align:start position:0%
the city and the planning board
doesn't

02:03:51.669 --> 02:03:51.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
02:03:51.679 --> 02:03:52.709 align:start position:0%
doesn't
consider

02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:03:53.910 --> 02:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
that kind of aspect i guess okay thank
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
you uh just before i we go on to uh to
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
executives as i still i'm still inclined
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
to accept this now
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh i think it'll go pretty fast and uh
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
that will lighten our load next
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
monday afternoon
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
from a committee standpoint but i wanted
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
to mention a couple of administrative
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
things that i may have admitted earlier
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
if members of the committee
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
were present in the llb need to take a
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
bathroom break
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
or take an urgent telephone call outside
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
the hallway
 
02:04:32.069 --> 02:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh you just do that on your own you
 
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
don't need to ask my permission you just
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
use your own judgment
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
but there is a there is a big but with
 
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
that if we are indeed
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
asking a question or a question is put
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
forth an executive session and that
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
happens and you're out of the room when
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
you return you will not be allowed to
 
02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:50.310 align:start position:0%
you return you will not be allowed to
vote

02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
on that particular question
 
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
so uh you need your judgment
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
especially during hearings but
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
especially be careful in executive
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%

and we would follow the same
 
02:12:41.199 --> 02:12:42.870 align:start position:0%
and we would follow the same

purchasing
 
02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:44.229 align:start position:0%
purchasing
requirements

02:12:44.229 --> 02:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
laid out in the statute by hillsborough
 
02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:48.470 align:start position:0%
laid out in the statute by hillsborough
county

02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
we have been in contact with all the
 
02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:55.599 align:start position:0%
hillsborough representatives and i have
 
02:12:55.599 --> 02:12:57.030 align:start position:0%
hillsborough representatives and i have
uh

02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
correspondence from the delegation chair
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
and vice chair from hillsborough
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
no objection
 
02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
and see no problem with carroll county
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
being added to their statue
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
i think that the
 
02:13:13.199 --> 02:13:15.350 align:start position:0%
i think that the
statute

02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
evidently has worked well for them
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's been in place for uh a number of
 
02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:21.830 align:start position:0%
uh it's been in place for uh a number of
years

02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
and uh i think it would be very
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to proceed for carroll
 
02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:29.030 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to proceed for carroll
county

02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:31.599 align:start position:0%
and um with that i'm i'm glad to answer

thank you very much uh chairman uh for
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
the record my name's gary abbott
 
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
i'm the executive vice president of the
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of new
 
02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:07.030 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of new
hampshire

02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that i ran this
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislation before i represent
 
02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
commercial and industrial contractors
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
and subcontractors
 
02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
and we only raised the concern
 
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns we had was having
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
multiple statutes for different counties
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
with different competitive bidding it
 
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
sounded like the amendment that was just
 
02:14:34.390 --> 02:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
proposed kind of addresses that concern
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we were concerned
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
about is having multiple county
 
02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding language in the
 
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
state statutes
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
cities and towns as far as i know do not
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
do this
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
and it just
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
i worked long and hard many years ago
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
on construction building codes and all
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
of those things
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
not to have individual codes in the
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
statutes but having a building code
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
review board that has the
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh power outside of it and was just a
 
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
concern that was raised with the
 
02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
contractors was we ought to be careful
 
02:15:11.669 --> 02:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
as to writing separate we have
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding requirements in the
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
statutes for the state
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
but as we develop
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
the concern was if we started to do it
 
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
for counties and then are we going to do
 
02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
it for cities and towns i would just
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
leave that with the committee it's
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
completely up to your committee and the
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
legislature to decide that but i thought
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
we would give that additional input
 
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like the amendment's going to
 
02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
follow another statute of the
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county and and that sounds
 
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
like a good plan if counties had a
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
standard statute that addressed it in
 
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
one place that makes a lot of sense i
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
would end there and thank you for
 
02:15:49.270 --> 02:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
letting me have the opportunity to speak
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you for giving us your
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
testimony if you have anything you'd
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
like to submit in writing please do
 
02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions uh we see your hand
 
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
up from representative power
 
02:16:06.069 --> 02:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for taking my
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
question my question um pertains to the
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment that's proposed
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
ties both the counties of hillsborough
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
and carroll together in the statute
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
and um i guess my concern is that due to
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that these counties are
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
dissimilar in many ways is it prudent
 
02:16:26.950 --> 02:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know have this
 
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
statute combined
 
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
the the concern being that if um
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
one of the counties wanted to make a
 
02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
change then it affects
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
the other county that's um listed in the
 
02:16:41.599 --> 02:16:42.870 align:start position:0%
the other county that's um listed in the
statute

02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
well good question let me let me bounce
 
02:16:47.509 --> 02:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
it back to representative fordelli is
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
the other counties combined or did did
 
02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
you just
 
02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
copy and paste language from one county
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
to the other document
 
02:16:56.709 --> 02:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
02:16:59.669 --> 02:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
refers to hillsboro hillsborough county
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
and in the amendment we just add carroll
 
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
county to that so the
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
title of the
 
02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph leads competitive bidding
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
hillsborough and carroll counties
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
so the same
 
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh provisions apply to both counties um
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
i think that the provisions
 
02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:20.950 align:start position:0%
i think that the provisions
are

02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh quite uh reasonable and standard in
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh other places that uh i have been and
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
worked in
 
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that
 
02:17:34.709 --> 02:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
any differences between our counties uh
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
will have a
 
02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
significant impact at all
 
02:17:40.830 --> 02:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate the
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you anything else
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%

02:17:48.399 --> 02:18:04.310 align:start position:0%

02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
to take a phone call this is melissa
 
02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
siemens the executive coordinator for
 
02:18:59.190 --> 02:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
the board of commissioners um i believe
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:02.559 --> 02:19:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:06.469 align:start position:0%
okay
seaman

02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
seaman
 
02:19:06.479 --> 02:19:11.910 align:start position:0%
seaman
yes

02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
on behalf of commissioner terry mccarthy
 
02:19:17.349 --> 02:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
she asked that i left
 
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know that the carroll county
 
02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
commissioners are opposed to hb 445
 
02:19:26.399 --> 02:19:27.349 align:start position:0%
commissioners are opposed to hb 445
and

02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
had passed a statement to me to read
 
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
the short argument is that this bill
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
even the amendment
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
infringes on the executive branch's
 
02:19:38.950 --> 02:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
authority to manage the county pursuant
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
to its obligations
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
the board of commissioners is
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for all county departments
 
02:19:46.950 --> 02:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
and exercise budgetary oversight of all
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
county finances
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
other responsibilities include the
 
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
management of county buildings and land
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
and personnel authority to permanently
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
hire discipline and discharge a county
 
02:19:56.560 --> 02:19:57.910 align:start position:0%
hire discipline and discharge a county
employee

02:19:57.910 --> 02:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
or out solely the responsibility of the
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
county commissioners unless otherwise
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
provided for
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
the statement goes on to note articles
 
02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire constitution
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
including article number 37 the
 
02:20:11.429 --> 02:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
separation of powers
 
02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
usurping the authority of the executive
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
the statement also references article 39
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
and notes the county convention is the
 
02:20:26.309 --> 02:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
legislative branch of government and the
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
powers of the convention are laid out by
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
law and constitution
 
02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:32.309 align:start position:0%
law and constitution
and

02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:37.590 align:start position:0%
 
which

02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:39.030 align:start position:0%
which
clearly

02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
delineates the powers of the delegation
 
02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
the commissioners are tasked with all
 
02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
necessary acts relating to the concerns
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
of the county
 
02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
and that is what i have handed to me in
 
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
this statement at this moment
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:56.469 --> 02:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
seaman i would ask that if you could
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
take that what you just read and submit
 
02:21:00.389 --> 02:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
it to the committee at the very least
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
submit it to our clerk so we can put it
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
i will certainly do that
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes just a quick question mr chair thank
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question how many
 
02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
uh signed up in a position or in support
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
on the blue shield thank you yeah we
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
have four in support and one in
 
02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:31.510 align:start position:0%
have four in support and one in
opposition

02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:33.429 --> 02:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
and those are the people who signed up
 
02:21:33.439 --> 02:21:35.190 align:start position:0%
and those are the people who signed up
before

02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
and i would say that
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we've had one
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
testify and and supported two in
 
02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.590 align:start position:0%
testify and and supported two in
opposition

02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
now this is
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
in my view not a candidate for
 
02:21:52.870 --> 02:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
executive session because of the immense
 
02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
amendment that's going to be coming
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
forth to change the entire film
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to consider that next week
 
02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
when we uh do the executive session
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair there is one new hand that is
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
raised from the attendees brody dushane
 
02:22:06.240 --> 02:22:09.270 align:start position:0%
raised from the attendees brody dushane
okay

02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
yes this is uh representative de chase
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
from carol 6 which is wolfeboro new
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh representing one of the um
 
02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
seats that is part of the carroll county
 
02:22:23.359 --> 02:22:25.030 align:start position:0%
seats that is part of the carroll county
delegation

02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
02:22:27.030 --> 02:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
i wasn't going to testify but i will now
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm testifying in support of this
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
legislation the purpose of this
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
legislation is to create oversight that
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
requires our county to have competitive
 
02:22:37.439 --> 02:22:38.710 align:start position:0%
requires our county to have competitive
contracts

02:22:38.710 --> 02:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
right we've had a number of head
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
department heads that have contracted
 
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
the same supplier of services or goods
 
02:22:49.349 --> 02:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
for now almost nearly uh over six years
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
without going to any competitive bid
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
process and so many of the delegates on
 
02:22:55.670 --> 02:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
behalf of our taxpayers
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
saw that there was a need for
 
02:23:00.710 --> 02:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
regulation to make sure that our county
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
was going through a competitive bid
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
process to save tax dollars and to save
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
tax money and to ensure that if we need
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
to make expenditures in other parts of
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
our county budget that we would be able
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
to shore up that kind of resources i
 
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
also would like to point out that the
 
02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
state's power does indeed trump the
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
county's power so if the state wants to
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
regulate a county like in the existing
 
02:23:23.590 --> 02:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
rsa for hillsborough county it can this
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and the amendment
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
that would change the legislation is
 
02:23:30.389 --> 02:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
perfectly constitutional it even though
 
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
it juxtaposes and um the commissioner
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
cited i believe it was rsa 30 that
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if the state wants to
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
step in and decides that it is necessary
 
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
to regulate a county it can do so in a
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
number of ways and this is one way that
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know the courts have upheld and no
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
one has ever challenged the power of the
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
state to ensure that a county goes
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
through a competitive bid process so the
 
02:23:55.270 --> 02:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is just to ensure
 
02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
that our county administrators
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
and the commissioners
 
02:24:02.550 --> 02:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
are having competitive bid processes for
 
02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
any kind of expenditure that's more than
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars and that would
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
also include delivery
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify everything and i am
 
02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
supporting this nearly every um it's a
 
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill
 
02:24:17.990 --> 02:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's 10 of our delegates who are
 
02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
currently on this piece of legislation i
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
believe it's 10 from carroll county
 
02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
and my assumption is nearly all 15 of
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
our county delegates will be voting for
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation thank you
 
02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:33.280 align:start position:0%

02:25:43.990 --> 02:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
carroll county commissioner
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
and uh was recently elected and
 
02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
i've reviewed the bill and i have some
 
02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:51.110 align:start position:0%
i've reviewed the bill and i have some
concerns

02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
um i think it's an awfully cumbersome
 
02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:55.830 align:start position:0%
um i think it's an awfully cumbersome
process

02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:56.790 align:start position:0%
process
uh

02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
to go to the executive committee with
 
02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:00.150 align:start position:0%
to go to the executive committee with
everything

02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
any any contract over five thousand
 
02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:03.349 align:start position:0%
any any contract over five thousand
dollars

02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:26:05.429 --> 02:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of service contracts
 
02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
that we might not need to competitively
 
02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:09.349 align:start position:0%
that we might not need to competitively
bid

02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
bid
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
history and who we've been
 
02:26:15.910 --> 02:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
been working with in the past and
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge of
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
of what needs to be done for the county
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
if if we have a service contract with
 
02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
someone that's performing well
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's a value and continuity of
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
extending that contract
 
02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:33.110 align:start position:0%
extending that contract
but

02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding as i see it that
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
the county delegation
 
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
appropriates the funding
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh the commissioners
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
oversee the spending of the the money to
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
to carry out the business of the county
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
i i don't
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
feel the need
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
for the executive committee
 
02:26:59.600 --> 02:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
for the executive committee
to

02:26:59.820 --> 02:26:59.830 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:26:59.830 --> 02:27:01.030 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh micromanage essentially every
 
02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:05.190 align:start position:0%
uh micromanage essentially every
contract

02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
contract
 
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
of five thousand dollars or more
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
it just seems like an overreach to me
 
02:27:12.389 --> 02:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that it's going to be
 
02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to create a lot of problems
 
02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
and take a lot of time
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
to have every one of those
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
every one of those contracts reviewed a
 
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
second time after decisions have been
 
02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:26.790 align:start position:0%
second time after decisions have been
made

02:27:26.790 --> 02:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
02:27:40.399 --> 02:27:43.670 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
commission

02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:45.270 --> 02:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
answer no questions would anybody else
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
hey thank you uh
 
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
for the additional testimony i'm sorry
 
02:27:57.910 --> 02:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
my computer decided it
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
had no more power so i had to go plug it
 
02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:01.270 align:start position:0%
had no more power so i had to go plug it
in

02:28:01.270 --> 02:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:28:05.349 --> 02:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to be uh relying more on
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
representing my fury because
 
02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm now blind to the
 
02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
to the raising their hands so is there
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else that has
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
indicated they'd like to speak

place has his hands still up but i i
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%

might be old there we go he's taking the
 
02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
stand down so no sir no mr chair we did

mr chair i have a question before we go
 
02:29:05.910 --> 02:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes is it all right if i ask it now
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
in the spirit of bipartisanship and i
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
really enjoy working with you i do have
 
02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
a question about the process that we're
 
02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:13.190 align:start position:0%
a question about the process that we're
using

02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
using
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
yeah this time
 
02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:16.710 align:start position:0%
yeah this time
and

02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
usually in the past in hearings a person
 
02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
testifies and then the committee members
 
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
get a chance to question that person
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
before we move on to the next person
 
02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
testifying um and
 
02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
that process is different not the one
 
02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
that we're using in this committee now
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if
 
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm finding it kind of confusing and
 
02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if this is the process we're
 
02:29:43.110 --> 02:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
going to be using
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
from now on
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's a great question what i'm going to
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
do is before we leave for the day
 
02:29:51.270 --> 02:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask for a critique of how
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
the day went and that would be one of
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
the comments that you make
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
to see if we want to you know alter or
 
02:29:59.270 --> 02:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
change the process going forward
 
02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
all right i would welcome those comments
 
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%

02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%

i'm obviously i'm at work and they're
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
closing down for the day so it's about
 
02:30:13.830 --> 02:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
an hour commute from here to home
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna
 
02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
shut down and come back uh once i get
 
02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:18.870 align:start position:0%

02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
any more executive sessions which
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%

yes
 
02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
hi it's ivy vann i also have a
 
02:30:44.710 --> 02:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
procedural question
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the day you said uh
 
02:30:50.309 --> 02:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
that we should say whether we were
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
by ourselves or not by ourselves so
 
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh my husband i shoot him we both work
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
in the same
 
02:31:02.230 --> 02:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
but i uh
 
02:31:05.349 --> 02:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
shooed him out of the room and
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering and it's very cold where
 
02:31:11.670 --> 02:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
he is now so my question is
 
02:31:13.750 --> 02:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
is it possible for him to work at his
 
02:31:16.469 --> 02:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
regular place across the room for me or
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
does he have to be in a different room
 
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
altogether no it certainly is possible
 
02:31:22.389 --> 02:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
as long as that's disclosed we're fine
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:31:26.070 --> 02:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay i am disclosing that my husband is
 
02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
working at the table across the room for
 
02:31:27.760 --> 02:31:28.630 align:start position:0%
working at the table across the room for
me

02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:29.750 align:start position:0%
me
thanks

02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
he'll be grateful
 
02:31:34.230 --> 02:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
all right well uh
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
we will reconvene in eight minutes
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
and mr chair just seen though that again
 
02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:40.630 align:start position:0%
and mr chair just seen though that again
procedurally

02:31:40.630 --> 02:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
procedurally
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
the reporting is going to continue we do
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
not stop recording it is still live
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
streamed if we do stop recording then we
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
lose the entire connection and therefore
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
consider your mic to still be yes that's
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
a very excellent reminder your mics are
 
02:31:57.270 --> 02:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
hot and if there's something that you
 
02:31:59.110 --> 02:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
might chat about privately that you
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
don't want to go out on the internet
 
02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
consider that before you say it
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
all right we'll see you at noontime
 
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:22.000 --> 02:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
 
simple

02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:25.520 --> 02:39:06.469 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:08.389 --> 02:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
i might drop in just to say hi to some
 
02:39:09.750 --> 02:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
of them because i'm not in that
 
02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
community at this time so that's right
 
02:39:14.910 --> 02:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
there's some of the people that
 
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:46.160 --> 02:40:04.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:04.319 --> 02:40:18.469 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:40:18.469 --> 02:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.399 --> 02:40:56.389 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:40:56.389 --> 02:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:56.399 --> 02:41:29.830 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:41:29.830 --> 02:41:29.840 align:start position:0%

02:41:39.670 --> 02:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
well i think i might
 
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
be one of the oldest selectmen
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:59.190 --> 02:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
yes i am
 
02:42:04.230 --> 02:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
i had about three bad days
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
you must be one of the 99.8 percent to
 
02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:33.269 align:start position:0%
you must be one of the 99.8 percent to
survive

02:42:33.269 --> 02:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
we're about to hear
 
02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:37.920 align:start position:0%

um i'm a co-sponsor of housewife 516 the
 
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor has a scheduling conflict
 
02:42:52.630 --> 02:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
which has become the norm
 
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
in this building 560 is a bill to deal
 
02:42:59.269 --> 02:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
solely with rockingham county it is a
 
02:43:02.790 --> 02:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
change in the length of offices for a
 
02:43:04.870 --> 02:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
number of positions
 
02:43:06.950 --> 02:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
and as uh
 
02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
as some of you may may have there is an
 
02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:17.269 --> 02:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
h the amendment
 
02:43:20.469 --> 02:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
adds an omitted position of county
 
02:43:23.190 --> 02:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
treasurer that was accidentally let off
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
left off the original writing of the
 
02:43:24.479 --> 02:43:25.670 align:start position:0%
left off the original writing of the
bill

02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:43:29.830 --> 02:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
the purpose of 560 is
 
02:43:31.750 --> 02:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
multiple i happen to also sit on the
 
02:43:33.030 --> 02:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
executive committee for rockingham
 
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
county and this is something that some
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
of us have spoken about and if you
 
02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
notice the um
 
02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsor list you'll see that with
 
02:43:42.150 --> 02:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
the exception of senator boatswell they
 
02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
are all members of the executive board
 
02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
of the county
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
so representative ryan asked me to uh
 
02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
bring a couple points for today to the
 
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
committee and the
 
02:43:53.190 --> 02:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
points that i share as well so i will
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
provide those to you
 
02:43:56.230 --> 02:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
once again silly affects rockingham
 
02:43:56.240 --> 02:43:57.750 align:start position:0%
once again silly affects rockingham
county

02:43:57.750 --> 02:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
the the county has experience already
 
02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
with four-year terms because our county
 
02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
commissioners run on a rotating basis so
 
02:44:07.110 --> 02:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
running a rotating
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh four-year term
 
02:44:10.469 --> 02:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
is really not going to
 
02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
be anything foreign to us
 
02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
the public does not seem to have an
 
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of county government as
 
02:44:16.630 --> 02:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're aware
 
02:44:19.190 --> 02:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
and when we have done recounts
 
02:44:20.550 --> 02:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
over the years one of the things that
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
we've noticed is that county government
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
really does have a tendency to just not
 
02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:24.790 align:start position:0%
really does have a tendency to just not
be

02:44:24.790 --> 02:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:44:27.110 --> 02:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
something that folks like to fill in
 
02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh we need to put this on a four-year
 
02:44:31.030 --> 02:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
election cycle in the off year of the
 
02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
presidential elections to give more
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
attention to these offices of the county
 
02:44:37.269 --> 02:44:37.279 align:start position:0%
and we would hope that this the first
 
02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
election affected by this law will be
 
02:44:40.389 --> 02:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
the 2022
 
02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
election all of these offices require
 
02:44:46.230 --> 02:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
special qualifications or experience
 
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
for the county attorney
 
02:44:50.030 --> 02:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
they must be an attorney typically with
 
02:44:52.469 --> 02:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial experience the sheriff is
 
02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
almost always someone with a law
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement background the register of
 
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
deeds is usually someone with experience
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
in researching and detailing deeds
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
the treasurer is almost always an
 
02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:04.469 align:start position:0%
the treasurer is almost always an
accountant

02:45:04.469 --> 02:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
accountant
 
02:45:06.150 --> 02:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
and although we went through the probate
 
02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
for most cases only exists in the
 
02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
constitution we should include that
 
02:45:13.349 --> 02:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
office on here to be consistent
 
02:45:14.710 --> 02:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
the third year term will give us more
 
02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
stability in these offices and a chance
 
02:45:18.469 --> 02:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
for long-range planning
 
02:45:20.150 --> 02:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
the disruption of having to run every
 
02:45:22.309 --> 02:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
other year is a distraction this change
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
will give us more efficient government
 
02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
for rockingham county please let us try
 
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
to see if this is worthy of being
 
02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:28.950 align:start position:0%
to see if this is worthy of being
adopted

02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
02:45:31.990 --> 02:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
in a broad scan manner i had the
 
02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
personal experience of spending some
 
02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
time with the
 
02:45:37.349 --> 02:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
county attorney
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
during the election period
 
02:45:41.590 --> 02:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
and it's uh it's amazing the amount of
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
time that is required by these four
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
these are full-time county people
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know they're not like the delegation
 
02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
that meets on a short-term basis and
 
02:45:51.990 --> 02:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
then we go away these are folks that are
 
02:45:53.670 --> 02:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
doing full-time work for the county and
 
02:45:54.950 --> 02:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
they have to take a tremendous amount of
 
02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
time out of their hands to run every two
 
02:45:58.790 --> 02:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
years for office and at state reps we
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
can all appreciate the
 
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
requirement of having to run every two
 
02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
years so that that's the gist of house
 
02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill 560
 
02:46:07.750 --> 02:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm happy to take any questions
 
02:46:11.429 --> 02:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
certainly that uh anybody may have
 
02:46:13.349 --> 02:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh any questions from the members of the
 
02:46:15.429 --> 02:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative
 
02:46:17.190 --> 02:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
the first hand i saw went up with all
 
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
due respect to the representative who's
 
02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:21.990 align:start position:0%

02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
disclosure we've entered the 1950s my
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
husband has come home for lunch
 
02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
very open concept home so he'll be
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
eating his lunch and saying goodbye in
 
02:46:37.110 --> 02:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
about half hour
 
02:46:38.550 --> 02:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
all right make sure he chews with his
 
02:46:42.309 --> 02:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:44.309 --> 02:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for that disclosure
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
any anyone spell representative michelle
 
02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
first yes representative
 
02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this seems to make
 
02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of sense are there any
 
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
i absolutely don't know
 
02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know where the counties do it
 
02:47:04.070 --> 02:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
i've i'm a lifelong resident of uh
 
02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
minus my college days and a little stiff
 
02:47:08.150 --> 02:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the 70s in baltimore pretty much a
 
02:47:09.990 --> 02:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
lifelong resident of rockingham county
 
02:47:11.429 --> 02:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
and i honestly we're gonna we've been
 
02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
our executive friend i've never had the
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
occasion to look to see what another
 
02:47:19.110 --> 02:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
county does so that would be more uh
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:33.429 --> 02:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense
 
02:47:34.950 --> 02:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
it certainly does
 
02:47:37.269 --> 02:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
any anyone else yes we uh the next stand
 
02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
up is representative
 
02:47:41.670 --> 02:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
02:47:44.230 --> 02:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and mine is not a
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
question in terms of this but i think if
 
02:47:51.510 --> 02:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
it is just one county
 
02:47:52.710 --> 02:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
02:47:55.030 --> 02:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
and you know it has to be uniform in
 
02:47:57.349 --> 02:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
that sense right if you're changing an
 
02:48:00.550 --> 02:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
election for one county and not the
 
02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's a is that a
 
02:48:09.349 --> 02:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
question to me yeah
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
um honestly um
 
02:48:14.230 --> 02:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
i you know the rockingham county is a
 
02:48:17.670 --> 02:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
legal subdivision in and of itself and
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
the actions of rockingham county are
 
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
are their own so
 
02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
you know as far as any sort of statute
 
02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
requiring that all counties do things in
 
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
a similar manner i'm not familiar with
 
02:48:32.550 --> 02:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
with a statute that would say that so
 
02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know this is something that the
 
02:48:35.429 --> 02:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
rockingham county
 
02:48:37.269 --> 02:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
officials wanted to bring forward and
 
02:48:37.279 --> 02:48:38.389 align:start position:0%
officials wanted to bring forward and
certainly

02:48:38.389 --> 02:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:48:40.630 --> 02:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
if this works other counties are more
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
than welcome to
 
02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
to jump on the bandwagon and this um
 
02:48:46.950 --> 02:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
02:48:49.030 --> 02:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
primary and general elections for the
 
02:48:50.950 --> 02:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
state and federal as well
 
02:48:52.469 --> 02:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
yeah the
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
the hope was that uh and if you look at
 
02:48:56.630 --> 02:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
the bill uh beginning of the election in
 
02:48:59.110 --> 02:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
november of 2022 it would be a midterm
 
02:49:00.630 --> 02:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
or what we would call a midterm election
 
02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:01.670 align:start position:0%
or what we would call a midterm election
cycle

02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
for that rather than dropping that in
 
02:49:04.469 --> 02:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:49:06.150 --> 02:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
with the presidential
 
02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
election cycle that's great any any
 
02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
other questions from
 
02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:14.790 align:start position:0%
other questions from
representative

02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:17.590 --> 02:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair one of um
 
02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire doesn't have any ability
 
02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
to recall
 
02:49:22.950 --> 02:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
an elected official there's no recall
 
02:49:25.429 --> 02:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
elections here and one of the reasons
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
that was was given when this issue came
 
02:49:30.070 --> 02:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
up in the past one of the reasons that
 
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
was given is that because we have our
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
elections every two years if someone is
 
02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
not functioning well or doing things
 
02:49:37.990 --> 02:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
that are unacceptable and the voters
 
02:49:39.190 --> 02:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
aren't happy with them they can just
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
vote them out
 
02:49:43.030 --> 02:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
and that's why we don't have referendums
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's why we don't have recall
 
02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
elections in new hampshire and i'm
 
02:49:46.319 --> 02:49:47.269 align:start position:0%
elections in new hampshire and i'm
wondering

02:49:47.269 --> 02:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
02:49:50.070 --> 02:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
you said your commissioners are voted in
 
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
for four-year terms
 
02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:54.710 align:start position:0%
is that
accurate

02:49:54.710 --> 02:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
the idea no um the idea is that the
 
02:49:59.750 --> 02:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
commitment our commissioners run on a
 
02:50:01.349 --> 02:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
rotating basis
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
and that was just as an example of how
 
02:50:05.429 --> 02:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
the county handles
 
02:50:05.439 --> 02:50:06.790 align:start position:0%
the county handles
um

02:50:06.790 --> 02:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:08.790 --> 02:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
right elections beyond two years because
 
02:50:11.590 --> 02:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
our commissioners do serve a longer term
 
02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
than two years and it rotates
 
02:50:17.510 --> 02:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
one of your commissioners does
 
02:50:19.349 --> 02:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh several of the commissioners do it's
 
02:50:20.630 --> 02:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
a staggered
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
okay but one at a time does
 
02:50:24.630 --> 02:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying yeah the
 
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
county commissioners are not up for
 
02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
election at the same time with the
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
exception of
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
it happens eventually after
 
02:50:34.710 --> 02:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
several cycles
 
02:50:36.389 --> 02:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
the way that they're staggered
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh but for the most part they're they're
 
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
not replaced all at once that's a
 
02:50:41.429 --> 02:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
continuity of government issue that the
 
02:50:43.510 --> 02:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
county likes to maintain so that you
 
02:50:46.389 --> 02:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
don't bring an entirely green board
 
02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
into a into a executive role and plot
 
02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
them down at one single time
 
02:50:53.830 --> 02:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
so so can i continue my question mr
 
02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:54.710 align:start position:0%
so so can i continue my question mr
chair

02:50:54.710 --> 02:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
go right ahead okay so
 
02:50:59.110 --> 02:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
in a case where one of these elected
 
02:51:03.910 --> 02:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
officials was um performing illegally or
 
02:51:06.150 --> 02:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
doing something that they shouldn't do
 
02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
there's no recourse to get them out of
 
02:51:08.160 --> 02:51:09.110 align:start position:0%
there's no recourse to get them out of
office

02:51:09.110 --> 02:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:51:09.120 --> 02:51:10.550 align:start position:0%
office
um

02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
02:51:15.190 --> 02:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
their next election do they would
 
02:51:17.349 --> 02:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm con that gives me a concern
 
02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
about this so i'm wondering how you
 
02:51:22.230 --> 02:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
would handle somebody who
 
02:51:24.469 --> 02:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
was corrupt for example
 
02:51:26.950 --> 02:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
if uh if uh an elected official of the
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
county level violence the law they would
 
02:51:30.550 --> 02:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
be subject to prosecution
 
02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
just just like anybody else
 
02:51:34.469 --> 02:51:34.479 align:start position:0%
but they wouldn't be subject to
 
02:51:40.230 --> 02:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:42.469 --> 02:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
they would still be the elected official
 
02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:46.389 --> 02:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
02:51:47.990 --> 02:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
because i i don't know if a judge could
 
02:51:49.670 --> 02:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
position that
 
02:51:49.680 --> 02:51:50.950 align:start position:0%
position that
um

02:51:50.950 --> 02:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:54.790 --> 02:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
after a guilty finding of a criminal act
 
02:51:54.800 --> 02:51:56.950 align:start position:0%
after a guilty finding of a criminal act
so

02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:51:58.870 --> 02:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
i guess the question would be what what
 
02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
would cause an elected official to be
 
02:52:05.830 --> 02:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what we have in our
 
02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
laws to allow that because we have
 
02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
elections every two years
 
02:52:15.670 --> 02:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you for taking my question i
 
02:52:17.830 --> 02:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
mean you run the risk of that
 
02:52:19.990 --> 02:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
certainly if someone's elected to a
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
two-year term and commits a crime
 
02:52:24.950 --> 02:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
at the initial stages of their term
 
02:52:27.110 --> 02:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know that that situation could
 
02:52:29.830 --> 02:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
certainly exist already right so as you
 
02:52:31.510 --> 02:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
know as far as the requirements go i
 
02:52:34.070 --> 02:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
mean you know the we do have certain
 
02:52:35.750 --> 02:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
requirements as far as eligibility for
 
02:52:37.190 --> 02:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
office for folks that are convicted
 
02:52:39.670 --> 02:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
felons and things like that so
 
02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:08.309 --> 02:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
attorney is one of the attendees but
 
02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
does not
 
02:53:12.790 --> 02:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:53:15.190 --> 02:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
miss conway if you want to uh speak if
 
02:53:16.630 --> 02:53:16.640 align:start position:0%

the same thing with sheriff massaso's if
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
if you're uh if you're online as well i

have you both asking to speak but
 
02:53:28.630 --> 02:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
just no indication yet electronically
 
02:53:32.230 --> 02:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:35.030 --> 02:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
my attorney has her hand raised and i am
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
asking to fund you okay uh attorney
 
02:53:40.950 --> 02:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
conway here yeah
 
02:53:44.710 --> 02:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
hi good morning everybody see me
 
02:53:44.720 --> 02:53:46.150 align:start position:0%
hi good morning everybody see me
yeah

02:53:46.150 --> 02:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
you can just hear me but you can't see
 
02:53:50.830 --> 02:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
me is that how it works right
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
so in in terms of the issue we were just
 
02:53:56.950 --> 02:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
discussing i i
 
02:53:58.950 --> 02:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'd have to research that
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
particular issue in terms of
 
02:54:04.150 --> 02:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
um if there's any statutory authority
 
02:54:07.110 --> 02:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
that would allow
 
02:54:09.910 --> 02:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
the public essentially to strip a person
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
of their position
 
02:54:14.070 --> 02:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
however what i will say at least with
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
regard to the county attorney's office
 
02:54:17.110 --> 02:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:54:18.469 --> 02:54:18.479 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
02:54:20.230 --> 02:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
to be the county attorney you have to be
 
02:54:23.190 --> 02:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
an attorney if you commit a crime
 
02:54:27.830 --> 02:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh you could be potentially um disbarred
 
02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh you could also be placed on leave
 
02:54:32.550 --> 02:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
i know that some of you are probably
 
02:54:34.469 --> 02:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
02:54:36.389 --> 02:54:36.399 align:start position:0%
before i became county attorney the
 
02:54:38.469 --> 02:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office investigated
 
02:54:40.790 --> 02:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
my predecessor
 
02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:41.750 align:start position:0%
my predecessor
who

02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:54:44.469 --> 02:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
was basically
 
02:54:47.269 --> 02:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
put on leave and we had an acting county
 
02:54:47.279 --> 02:54:48.630 align:start position:0%
put on leave and we had an acting county
attorney

02:54:48.630 --> 02:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
02:54:50.630 --> 02:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
who was appointed
 
02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh tim befetti who is an assistant
 
02:54:55.590 --> 02:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
attorney general so um
 
02:54:57.910 --> 02:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
that type of thing
 
02:55:00.389 --> 02:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
occurred although mr reems was never
 
02:55:03.190 --> 02:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
charged with anything uh criminally but
 
02:55:04.870 --> 02:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
there were some allegations and there
 
02:55:07.910 --> 02:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
was an investigation and there there is
 
02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
a procedure in terms of how to deal with
 
02:55:11.429 --> 02:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing
 
02:55:13.750 --> 02:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the statutory provision
 
02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm not aware and i have to
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
look into that but
 
02:55:20.790 --> 02:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
just in terms of support of the statute
 
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
i am in support of it i you know in
 
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
rockingham county we have about 41
 
02:55:27.750 --> 02:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
people that work in this office we're
 
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
the largest law firm in rockingham
 
02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:30.710 align:start position:0%
the largest law firm in rockingham
county

02:55:30.710 --> 02:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:31.590 align:start position:0%
county
and

02:55:31.590 --> 02:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:55:34.230 --> 02:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
when an official such as myself has to
 
02:55:36.230 --> 02:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
work every two years
 
02:55:38.950 --> 02:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
it can create some disruption in the
 
02:55:40.950 --> 02:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
office as you can probably imagine i
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
think you know my staff it creates some
 
02:55:47.510 --> 02:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
some anxiety and a feeling of just
 
02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
you know not knowing the future because
 
02:55:52.469 --> 02:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
the reality is is the county attorney i
 
02:55:55.269 --> 02:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
set the policies in the office
 
02:55:57.269 --> 02:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
i'm responsible for making sure that
 
02:55:59.910 --> 02:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's a positive work environment
 
02:56:02.150 --> 02:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
i set the expectations for everyone in
 
02:56:03.990 --> 02:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
my office in terms of what they need to
 
02:56:06.389 --> 02:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
be doing
 
02:56:09.910 --> 02:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
to do their job effectively and
 
02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:11.190 align:start position:0%
to do their job effectively and
when

02:56:11.190 --> 02:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
i have to run for county attorney every
 
02:56:15.349 --> 02:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
two years my staff they have no idea
 
02:56:16.710 --> 02:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen and they don't
 
02:56:19.030 --> 02:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
know who their boss will be
 
02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
my employee employees also don't get
 
02:56:22.870 --> 02:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
paid a ton of money
 
02:56:24.870 --> 02:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
comparatively speaking in terms of if
 
02:56:27.269 --> 02:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
they worked at a law firm
 
02:56:29.269 --> 02:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
so having that kind of that sense of
 
02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
sort of job security and knowing
 
02:56:33.670 --> 02:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
you know what you're going to face in
 
02:56:34.710 --> 02:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
the next
 
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
number of years as an employee i think
 
02:56:38.950 --> 02:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
is important to the employees of of our
 
02:56:42.389 --> 02:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
offices um and also i just if you look
 
02:56:44.550 --> 02:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
at if you looked at a law firm like
 
02:56:46.950 --> 02:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
maybe mclean or something in manchester
 
02:56:49.349 --> 02:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
and you know the partners the partners
 
02:56:50.630 --> 02:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
there don't
 
02:56:52.710 --> 02:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
flip over every two years i mean that
 
02:56:55.670 --> 02:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
would be crazy it would be crazy because
 
02:56:57.750 --> 02:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
it would just cause so much disruption
 
02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
to that that law office um
 
02:57:02.950 --> 02:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
and so for the same reasons i
 
02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:04.070 align:start position:0%
and so for the same reasons i
i

02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:57:06.710 --> 02:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
am in support of a four-year term rather
 
02:57:09.670 --> 02:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
than two and it's also difficult to get
 
02:57:12.230 --> 02:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
anything done in a office like this in
 
02:57:14.230 --> 02:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
two years in terms of programming like
 
02:57:17.110 --> 02:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
drug courts or veterans court
 
02:57:18.870 --> 02:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
diversion i mean we might be able to
 
02:57:21.990 --> 02:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
start things like that but to try to get
 
02:57:24.469 --> 02:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
a court like that or a diversion program
 
02:57:27.510 --> 02:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
going and really um becoming a solid
 
02:57:29.830 --> 02:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
program for the citizens of our county
 
02:57:32.710 --> 02:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's really difficult to do that in two
 
02:57:34.630 --> 02:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
years and arguably it wouldn't be two
 
02:57:37.269 --> 02:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
years because you know we have to start
 
02:57:37.279 --> 02:57:39.910 align:start position:0%
years because you know we have to start
campaigning

02:57:39.910 --> 02:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
campaigning
 
02:57:41.910 --> 02:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
you all know how it is because your term
 
02:57:43.830 --> 02:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
is two years but i mean basically you're
 
02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
you're always campaigning you can never
 
02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:47.110 align:start position:0%
you're always campaigning you can never
stop

02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
stop
 
02:57:49.830 --> 02:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
rockingham county is
 
02:57:53.349 --> 02:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
towns in one city it's a huge geographic
 
02:57:53.359 --> 02:57:54.389 align:start position:0%
towns in one city it's a huge geographic
area

02:57:54.389 --> 02:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:57:56.710 --> 02:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
and when you're campaigning obviously
 
02:57:58.469 --> 02:57:58.479 align:start position:0%
you have to try to hit all of those
 
02:58:01.110 --> 02:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
different towns in the city
 
02:58:03.750 --> 02:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
we have to fundraise obviously to buy
 
02:58:06.469 --> 02:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
signs and mailers and things like that
 
02:58:08.150 --> 02:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
and it takes
 
02:58:10.630 --> 02:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of time
 
02:58:13.030 --> 02:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
to do that and it's time away from this
 
02:58:14.469 --> 02:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
office it's time away from the
 
02:58:16.469 --> 02:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
rockingham county attorney's office and
 
02:58:18.150 --> 02:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
the work that we do here and i'm sure
 
02:58:19.750 --> 02:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
you all know
 
02:58:22.150 --> 02:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
we prosecute serious felony level
 
02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
offenses um like rape like burglaries
 
02:58:26.870 --> 02:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
like home invasions
 
02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:27.670 align:start position:0%
like home invasions
um

02:58:27.670 --> 02:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:30.070 --> 02:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
serious violent assaults negligent
 
02:58:30.080 --> 02:58:32.389 align:start position:0%
serious violent assaults negligent
homicide

02:58:32.389 --> 02:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
homicide
 
02:58:34.710 --> 02:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
these are cases that are very important
 
02:58:37.349 --> 02:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
to the citizens of our county i mean we
 
02:58:39.269 --> 02:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
need to do a good job
 
02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that we're
 
02:58:43.830 --> 02:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
professional in handling these cases
 
02:58:46.389 --> 02:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
ethically and the county attorney should
 
02:58:48.790 --> 02:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
be in the office
 
02:58:51.670 --> 02:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
all the time to supervise the attorneys
 
02:58:53.590 --> 02:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
to supervise the legal assistant to
 
02:58:55.349 --> 02:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
supervise the victim advocates to
 
02:58:57.510 --> 02:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
supervise the investigators
 
02:58:59.910 --> 02:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that these cases are
 
02:59:02.389 --> 02:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
being handled appropriately
 
02:59:04.469 --> 02:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
um because we're talking about people's
 
02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
lives we're talking about things we're
 
02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
talking about their families and we're
 
02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
also talking about defendants
 
02:59:10.790 --> 02:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know we want to make sure that we're
 
02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
handling cases fairly and we're treating
 
02:59:12.960 --> 02:59:14.469 align:start position:0%
handling cases fairly and we're treating
people

02:59:14.469 --> 02:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
fairly and equally so
 
02:59:19.750 --> 02:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
when we have to campaign
 
02:59:21.750 --> 02:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
all the time essentially or you know
 
02:59:24.230 --> 02:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
every other year it takes a tremendous
 
02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
amount of time away from our job
 
02:59:29.810 --> 02:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
responsibilities here in the office
 
02:59:29.820 --> 02:59:31.590 align:start position:0%
responsibilities here in the office
[Music]

02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:59:33.349 --> 02:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
so i think that's really all i have to
 
02:59:34.870 --> 02:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
say but i'm happy to answer any
 
02:59:34.880 --> 02:59:37.110 align:start position:0%
say but i'm happy to answer any
questions

02:59:37.110 --> 02:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:59:38.870 --> 02:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay do we have uh
 
02:59:43.670 --> 02:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
the sheriff available as well we do
 
02:59:45.910 --> 02:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
might be ready to go okay sheriff you're
 
02:59:45.920 --> 02:59:47.030 align:start position:0%
might be ready to go okay sheriff you're
up

02:59:47.030 --> 02:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:59:49.750 --> 02:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
can you hear me all right yes perfectly
 
02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
good i have to i have to agree with that
 
02:59:53.910 --> 02:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
county attorney um
 
02:59:55.990 --> 02:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
on everything that she said uh going
 
02:59:57.309 --> 02:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
02:59:57.319 --> 02:59:58.950 align:start position:0%
back to the
accountability

02:59:58.950 --> 02:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
03:00:02.389 --> 03:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
of uh elected officials um
 
03:00:03.830 --> 03:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:00:05.670 --> 03:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
i mean being being a law enforcement
 
03:00:07.429 --> 03:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
officer and being on police stands and
 
03:00:09.670 --> 03:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
trains council
 
03:00:11.830 --> 03:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
we have a high ethic for our law
 
03:00:13.590 --> 03:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement personnel
 
03:00:13.600 --> 03:00:14.469 align:start position:0%
enforcement personnel
um

03:00:14.469 --> 03:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:16.790 --> 03:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
i think if the sheriff
 
03:00:19.269 --> 03:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
did something illegally uh number one
 
03:00:21.349 --> 03:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
that we would lose our police stands and
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
we would lose our
 
03:00:25.510 --> 03:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
certification a police certification
 
03:00:25.520 --> 03:00:26.550 align:start position:0%
certification a police certification
um

03:00:26.550 --> 03:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:28.550 --> 03:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
and i think at that point i mean you
 
03:00:31.110 --> 03:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
would have to resign from that office
 
03:00:32.710 --> 03:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
because you're technically not a law
 
03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh officer
 
03:00:37.030 --> 03:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:39.750 align:start position:0%
and there's
um

03:00:39.750 --> 03:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:41.110 --> 03:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's any other
 
03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
instances where other officials had to
 
03:00:45.269 --> 03:00:45.279 align:start position:0%
resign for corruption
 
03:00:47.510 --> 03:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
um but that's something that would have
 
03:00:49.269 --> 03:00:49.279 align:start position:0%
to work out with you know
 
03:00:51.030 --> 03:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
with the judges or whatever that if
 
03:00:52.870 --> 03:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
someone did something wrong
 
03:00:54.469 --> 03:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
part of the agreement was that you would
 
03:00:56.550 --> 03:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
have to resign from your office
 
03:00:58.630 --> 03:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
because i mean being the sheriff
 
03:01:01.269 --> 03:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
you can't have a sheriff that's corrupt
 
03:01:03.670 --> 03:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
i mean you know no one's above the law
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
and we're here to uphold the law of the
 
03:01:07.750 --> 03:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
03:01:10.389 --> 03:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that helps you or not
 
03:01:13.030 --> 03:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
but but getting back to
 
03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:14.389 align:start position:0%
but but getting back to
um

03:01:14.389 --> 03:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:17.670 --> 03:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
talking points on my office alone i mean
 
03:01:21.030 --> 03:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'm coming off my first term and a
 
03:01:23.110 --> 03:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
well-run organization
 
03:01:25.190 --> 03:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
should have a clear and defined set of
 
03:01:28.150 --> 03:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
long-term goals at least three to five
 
03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:29.349 align:start position:0%
long-term goals at least three to five
years

03:01:29.349 --> 03:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:01:32.469 --> 03:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
these goals help set the direction of
 
03:01:34.630 --> 03:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
department operations by executing
 
03:01:37.110 --> 03:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
short-term goals to accomplish the
 
03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
desired uh long-term results uh two
 
03:01:42.150 --> 03:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
years isn't is not
 
03:01:44.630 --> 03:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
not sufficient time to successfully
 
03:01:46.870 --> 03:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
envision implement and accomplish
 
03:01:49.429 --> 03:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
accomplish long-range planning goals and
 
03:01:49.439 --> 03:01:50.710 align:start position:0%
accomplish long-range planning goals and
objectives

03:01:50.710 --> 03:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
objectives
 
03:01:52.950 --> 03:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
i campaigned on
 
03:01:55.190 --> 03:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
enhancing a rockingham county drug task
 
03:01:55.200 --> 03:01:56.150 align:start position:0%
enhancing a rockingham county drug task
force

03:01:56.150 --> 03:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
force
 
03:01:58.389 --> 03:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
and we've worked hard
 
03:02:00.389 --> 03:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
to improve community relations
 
03:02:03.349 --> 03:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the 37 towns in rockingham
 
03:02:05.670 --> 03:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
county not only with law enforcement but
 
03:02:07.269 --> 03:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
for the people that elected me as
 
03:02:07.279 --> 03:02:09.030 align:start position:0%
for the people that elected me as
sheriff

03:02:09.030 --> 03:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
sheriff
 
03:02:12.230 --> 03:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
we find it that it takes time to reach
 
03:02:15.349 --> 03:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
all 37 communities and reach out what
 
03:02:17.110 --> 03:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's office does
 
03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
and what we're
 
03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
able to do to provide the best possible
 
03:02:23.750 --> 03:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement services around um just
 
03:02:26.309 --> 03:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
our drug unit alone uh we had the
 
03:02:29.269 --> 03:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
largest seizure of
 
03:02:32.230 --> 03:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
fentanyl and state history but that was
 
03:02:35.030 --> 03:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know that was a goal that took us
 
03:02:37.750 --> 03:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
close to almost two years
 
03:02:39.910 --> 03:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
to to make the arrest and get guilty
 
03:02:41.750 --> 03:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
convictions and
 
03:02:43.190 --> 03:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know and get this stuff off the
 
03:02:46.070 --> 03:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
street and it takes a while to
 
03:02:49.349 --> 03:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
enhance that unit and you work you know
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
together with all the chiefs
 
03:02:53.190 --> 03:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
so they know what we're doing and stuff
 
03:02:54.389 --> 03:02:54.399 align:start position:0%
like that
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
it just takes a lot of time
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement programs like i said
 
03:03:01.190 --> 03:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
take time to implement sometimes they
 
03:03:03.910 --> 03:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
require legislative actions coordinating
 
03:03:06.070 --> 03:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
with multiple agencies and establishing
 
03:03:07.510 --> 03:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
new policies
 
03:03:10.230 --> 03:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
an effective way thought of our progress
 
03:03:11.910 --> 03:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
could take years to
 
03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
organize plan and execute you know a
 
03:03:16.550 --> 03:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
longer term would allow our department
 
03:03:18.790 --> 03:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to create more in-depth
 
03:03:20.550 --> 03:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
programs to help better protect our
 
03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:21.910 align:start position:0%
programs to help better protect our
citizens

03:03:21.910 --> 03:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
03:03:23.429 --> 03:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
you know and it takes
 
03:03:26.070 --> 03:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
it takes you know for new officials like
 
03:03:27.590 --> 03:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
myself i mean i've been with the
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
sheriff's office for 40 years
 
03:03:31.670 --> 03:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
so i know i basically know everybody
 
03:03:34.230 --> 03:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
there their staff but as time changes
 
03:03:36.070 --> 03:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
you get new personnel and new
 
03:03:38.230 --> 03:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
administrative assistants assistant
 
03:03:41.269 --> 03:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
administrative assistants i mean people
 
03:03:44.230 --> 03:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
um they get promoted they get put in new
 
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
jobs and that's stuff that we all we
 
03:03:48.230 --> 03:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
have to work with these people make sure
 
03:03:50.469 --> 03:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
that they're doing doing the right thing
 
03:03:50.479 --> 03:03:52.469 align:start position:0%
that they're doing doing the right thing
um

03:03:52.469 --> 03:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:54.230 --> 03:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know like i said it just takes times
 
03:03:56.070 --> 03:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
it would it would be a lot easier for us
 
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
to have longer terms
 
03:04:00.710 --> 03:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
as far as campaigning goes i agree with
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
the with the county
 
03:04:04.550 --> 03:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
um attorney um
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
i mean right now i mean every four years
 
03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
we're in on a presidential election now
 
03:04:14.070 --> 03:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
on this term alone um we were actually
 
03:04:16.469 --> 03:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
on the back of the ballot so people
 
03:04:18.630 --> 03:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
aren't paying attention okay to the
 
03:04:21.110 --> 03:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
count to the county uh officials that
 
03:04:23.910 --> 03:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
are running for office i mean all of us
 
03:04:26.230 --> 03:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
i mean most of the time we're on the
 
03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
bottom of the ballot and by the time
 
03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
people look at us
 
03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:30.630 align:start position:0%
people look at us
um

03:04:30.630 --> 03:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:31.830 --> 03:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:04:33.349 --> 03:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard for them to make a
 
03:04:35.510 --> 03:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
decision they need to you know when the
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
when they're electing a president or you
 
03:04:39.750 --> 03:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
know it's a big election you know i mean
 
03:04:41.830 --> 03:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
at least they'll have time to to look
 
03:04:44.469 --> 03:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
into us to see you know what we've been
 
03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
doing for the last you know four years
 
03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
or two years i mean two years now you
 
03:04:52.950 --> 03:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
know um so i get a
 
03:04:54.790 --> 03:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
and then you know plus campaigning i
 
03:04:57.910 --> 03:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
mean rock dan county is is a big county
 
03:05:01.429 --> 03:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
we have 37 communities i mean just
 
03:05:03.910 --> 03:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
campaigning alone
 
03:05:06.230 --> 03:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
to try doing the old-fashioned way of
 
03:05:08.469 --> 03:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
going to parades and meeting people
 
03:05:10.469 --> 03:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
going to meet and greets it takes up a
 
03:05:12.230 --> 03:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
lot of time it takes up a lot of time
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's in my office where i could be in
 
03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:17.760 align:start position:0%

job done so
 
03:05:29.429 --> 03:05:29.439 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman members of the
 
03:06:21.750 --> 03:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
committee my name is kathy stacy i'm the
 
03:06:24.070 --> 03:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
rockingham county register of deeds as
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
the committee should be aware i did send
 
03:06:28.469 --> 03:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
in a written testimony to you i don't
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
want to
 
03:06:31.349 --> 03:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
reiterate reiterate everything else
 
03:06:33.990 --> 03:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's been said today but i i
 
03:06:36.630 --> 03:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely ask you to support this bill
 
03:06:38.469 --> 03:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh the question that was asked by one of
 
03:06:40.070 --> 03:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
the representatives with regards to the
 
03:06:42.389 --> 03:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
commission's district the commissioners
 
03:06:45.349 --> 03:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
run so what happens is every third year
 
03:06:47.429 --> 03:06:47.439 align:start position:0%
they get a four year term
 
03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
so that's it's a is a rotation so that
 
03:06:51.269 --> 03:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
we do have consistency in rockingham
 
03:06:52.950 --> 03:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
county i think it's a wonderful thing
 
03:06:54.230 --> 03:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
and it's actually another piece of
 
03:06:56.710 --> 03:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
legislation that representative weiler
 
03:06:58.790 --> 03:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
put in several years ago and quite a few
 
03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
of the other counties have opted in to
 
03:07:03.190 --> 03:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
03:07:06.070 --> 03:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
i will just say that
 
03:07:07.590 --> 03:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think it is important to have
 
03:07:11.349 --> 03:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
consistency in the office my office is
 
03:07:14.790 --> 03:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
quite busy and as you know i i have the
 
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
largest volume of records in the state
 
03:07:20.150 --> 03:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
my records date back to 1629
 
03:07:22.870 --> 03:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
and one of the biggest things obviously
 
03:07:24.790 --> 03:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
is making sure that the public can
 
03:07:26.710 --> 03:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
access those records
 
03:07:29.670 --> 03:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
and during my tenure the most recent um
 
03:07:31.349 --> 03:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
software changes that we made in
 
03:07:33.349 --> 03:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
virginia's office it took me over three
 
03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
and a half years
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
to get a conversion to get the product
 
03:07:41.590 --> 03:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
tested and to get it out there for the
 
03:07:43.110 --> 03:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
public it isn't something that can be
 
03:07:45.510 --> 03:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
done in a year or two year it's a very
 
03:07:48.309 --> 03:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
lengthy process and my concern obviously
 
03:07:50.950 --> 03:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
would be if i left in the middle
 
03:07:50.960 --> 03:07:52.710 align:start position:0%
would be if i left in the middle
um

03:07:52.710 --> 03:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
that you know a year you know in every
 
03:07:57.030 --> 03:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
year the second year you're spending a
 
03:07:58.870 --> 03:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
lot of time
 
03:08:01.030 --> 03:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately campaigning
 
03:08:03.269 --> 03:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
um which which sometimes takes you out
 
03:08:05.269 --> 03:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
of the office and i am a hands-on
 
03:08:06.870 --> 03:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
register i am here
 
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
every day i know every job that's in my
 
03:08:13.110 --> 03:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
office and i can perform each job um and
 
03:08:14.630 --> 03:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that you have
 
03:08:16.630 --> 03:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who comes into
 
03:08:18.790 --> 03:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
a position such as mine that has the
 
03:08:21.510 --> 03:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge in the background and um you
 
03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
know when you look at
 
03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
surrounding states maine has a four-year
 
03:08:26.469 --> 03:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
term for all their county elected
 
03:08:29.190 --> 03:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
officials massachusetts has a six-year
 
03:08:31.590 --> 03:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
term uh new jersey has a five-year term
 
03:08:33.830 --> 03:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
new york and pennsylvania four years a
 
03:08:35.269 --> 03:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
lot of the other states vermont and
 
03:08:38.070 --> 03:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
connecticut but the town clerks um do
 
03:08:39.590 --> 03:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
this service everything's done at the
 
03:08:42.389 --> 03:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
local level for registry of d's that is
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
anyway um but you know i can't i can't
 
03:08:47.830 --> 03:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
stress enough the fact that we have seen
 
03:08:49.990 --> 03:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
when there's been issues with um an
 
03:08:53.269 --> 03:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
official in rockingham county and
 
03:08:55.030 --> 03:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
commissioners took charge and and things
 
03:08:59.190 --> 03:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
got you know changed in that office and
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
the person was asked to leave and they
 
03:09:04.070 --> 03:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
did they were locked out of the office
 
03:09:06.070 --> 03:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
03:09:07.590 --> 03:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
situation that was happening in that
 
03:09:10.389 --> 03:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
office but uh other than that if you
 
03:09:12.469 --> 03:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
have any questions for me i'm happy to
 
03:09:14.710 --> 03:09:14.720 align:start position:0%

03:09:20.469 --> 03:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
thank you miss stacy
 
03:09:22.870 --> 03:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
is there any other questions from the
 
03:09:22.880 --> 03:09:25.429 align:start position:0%
is there any other questions from the
committee

03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:27.110 --> 03:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative gallagher you have
 
03:09:29.110 --> 03:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
03:09:33.510 --> 03:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
so we've heard a lot of
 
03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:35.110 align:start position:0%
so we've heard a lot of
points

03:09:35.110 --> 03:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
points
 
03:09:37.429 --> 03:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
in favor of
 
03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
moving to for your election cycles but
 
03:09:43.990 --> 03:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
one thing i'm still kind of unclear on
 
03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:45.510 align:start position:0%
one thing i'm still kind of unclear on
is

03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
why this should only apply to rockingham
 
03:09:48.560 --> 03:09:50.550 align:start position:0%
why this should only apply to rockingham
county

03:09:50.550 --> 03:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
county
 
03:09:52.550 --> 03:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if some of the people
 
03:09:57.030 --> 03:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
should could answer the question of if
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
four-year election cycles are so good
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
why not extend them to the whole state
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
rather than having them just for
 
03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:12.070 --> 03:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
good question anybody online or whether
 
03:10:12.080 --> 03:10:13.110 align:start position:0%
good question anybody online or whether
you

03:10:13.110 --> 03:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:14.150 align:start position:0%
you
uh

03:10:14.150 --> 03:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:16.229 --> 03:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
we're under appearance and we want to
 
03:10:18.469 --> 03:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
want to take a shot at that can you
 
03:10:20.630 --> 03:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
still hear me mr chairman this is kathy
 
03:10:22.950 --> 03:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
stacy yes
 
03:10:25.510 --> 03:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
so my discussions with representative
 
03:10:27.830 --> 03:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
weiler was he wanted to do this as a
 
03:10:30.070 --> 03:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
pilot just as he did the commissioner
 
03:10:31.349 --> 03:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
when he changed the commissioner's
 
03:10:31.359 --> 03:10:32.389 align:start position:0%
when he changed the commissioner's
districts

03:10:32.389 --> 03:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
districts
 
03:10:34.630 --> 03:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
to see how it worked i mean obviously i
 
03:10:37.750 --> 03:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
am sure that um and the new hampshire
 
03:10:38.950 --> 03:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
and the legislative chair for the new
 
03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire association of counties and
 
03:10:43.510 --> 03:10:43.520 align:start position:0%

03:10:44.710 --> 03:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
where we stand on various pieces of
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
legislation um mike you know i would
 
03:10:51.429 --> 03:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
imagine you'll be hearing from us in the
 
03:10:53.269 --> 03:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
near future
 
03:10:55.510 --> 03:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
some counties probably will want to you
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
know if if if
 
03:10:59.349 --> 03:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know that some may want to some may
 
03:11:00.950 --> 03:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
not i don't know
 
03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh however i know that representative
 
03:11:04.630 --> 03:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
weiler's intention was to make this a
 
03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
pilot see how it works see if it worked
 
03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
well and then if other people wanted to
 
03:11:10.630 --> 03:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
hop on just like the other piece of
 
03:11:12.630 --> 03:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
legislation prior to this um to see how
 
03:11:14.870 --> 03:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
it goes but that's that's pretty much
 
03:11:16.550 --> 03:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
all i know about why uh he did what he
 
03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:18.070 align:start position:0%
all i know about why uh he did what he
did

03:11:18.070 --> 03:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:11:19.990 --> 03:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that was a good clarification
 
03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
anything else representative gallagher
 
03:11:25.190 --> 03:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
um that will be
 
03:11:28.630 --> 03:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
or yeah that's
 
03:11:30.550 --> 03:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
fine for now yeah
 
03:11:33.429 --> 03:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the uh
 
03:11:37.269 --> 03:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
from the public or that be observing or
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:42.630 --> 03:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
no sir
 
03:11:44.710 --> 03:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
okay i think that's it then uh right
 
03:11:46.229 --> 03:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
this bill will be
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
on the docket for next
 
03:11:50.469 --> 03:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
next monday
 
03:11:53.349 --> 03:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
very tech session excuse me
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
and at this point that concludes our
 
03:11:57.910 --> 03:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
hearings for the day i would ask the
 
03:11:57.920 --> 03:11:58.950 align:start position:0%
hearings for the day i would ask the
committee

03:11:58.950 --> 03:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
not leave the meeting yet
 
03:12:03.590 --> 03:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
unless you have uh
 
03:12:05.269 --> 03:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
an urgent appointment elsewhere because
 
03:12:06.790 --> 03:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
03:12:09.269 --> 03:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh do a just a few minutes of critique
 
03:12:11.349 --> 03:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
as to how the day went
 
03:12:13.910 --> 03:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
and how uh you might suggest
 
03:12:15.910 --> 03:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
to make improvements uh continuous
 
03:12:19.510 --> 03:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
improvement is a goal of mine and and uh
 
03:12:21.429 --> 03:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
i certainly would welcome
 
03:12:24.150 --> 03:12:24.160 align:start position:0%

03:12:26.229 --> 03:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:29.520 --> 03:12:34.309 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:12:34.309 --> 03:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:34.319 --> 03:12:35.349 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
still on the committee i see uh
 
03:12:39.190 --> 03:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative matt cutie has her hand
 
03:12:41.670 --> 03:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
up but i would again
 
03:12:44.389 --> 03:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh i certainly would welcome your inputs
 
03:12:44.399 --> 03:12:45.110 align:start position:0%
uh i certainly would welcome your inputs
uh

03:12:45.110 --> 03:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:12:47.750 --> 03:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
we did some experimenting today we
 
03:12:49.429 --> 03:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
we took some
 
03:12:51.750 --> 03:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh testimony at the end for the
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
committee as uh representative porter
 
03:12:57.190 --> 03:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned but we also
 
03:12:59.910 --> 03:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh did a little bit of uh back and forth
 
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
between the committee and testifiers as
 
03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:03.670 align:start position:0%
between the committee and testifiers as
well

03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:13:05.110 --> 03:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
some of the other things that we did
 
03:13:06.150 --> 03:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
today is
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
trying to stay on schedule by limiting
 
03:13:13.030 --> 03:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
testimony uh by with with time frames
 
03:13:15.110 --> 03:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh we still get everybody who
 
03:13:16.630 --> 03:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak did get a chance to
 
03:13:19.510 --> 03:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
there certainly were no filibusters
 
03:13:21.120 --> 03:13:23.269 align:start position:0%
there certainly were no filibusters
today

03:13:23.269 --> 03:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:13:23.279 --> 03:13:25.750 align:start position:0%
today
so

03:13:25.750 --> 03:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:28.630 --> 03:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
again i would like to hear your your
 
03:13:30.710 --> 03:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
feedback i do know
 
03:13:32.630 --> 03:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
that with one of our bills coming up
 
03:13:34.150 --> 03:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
next monday
 
03:13:36.630 --> 03:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
i'm anticipating a longer
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh period of testifying and for that
 
03:13:41.190 --> 03:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
goal i scheduled an hour
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a half hour so
 
03:13:46.630 --> 03:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
we'll see how that goes but uh let's
 
03:13:48.309 --> 03:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
start with uh representative mitch
 
03:13:48.319 --> 03:13:50.309 align:start position:0%
start with uh representative mitch
cooney

03:13:50.309 --> 03:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
cooney
 
03:13:52.630 --> 03:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just want to say
 
03:13:55.269 --> 03:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you it felt so much more
 
03:13:57.510 --> 03:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing the way we are doing
 
03:13:57.520 --> 03:13:58.229 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing the way we are doing
it

03:13:58.229 --> 03:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:14:01.349 --> 03:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
and i truly appreciate this openness and
 
03:14:04.229 --> 03:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
inclusiveness i was a nervous wreck
 
03:14:06.229 --> 03:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
before today
 
03:14:08.830 --> 03:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
and this being my first uh
 
03:14:12.309 --> 03:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
committee uh i mean first meeting with
 
03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
03:14:16.870 --> 03:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
and the second i would make a comment
 
03:14:19.670 --> 03:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
about you know i am a creature of habit
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of blue sheet how many opposing
 
03:14:26.070 --> 03:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
how many supporting not being able to
 
03:14:27.429 --> 03:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
see that
 
03:14:29.670 --> 03:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
virtually that would be something that
 
03:14:30.710 --> 03:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
would help
 
03:14:33.349 --> 03:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
me understand how this bill is received
 
03:14:33.359 --> 03:14:34.389 align:start position:0%
me understand how this bill is received
outside

03:14:34.389 --> 03:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
outside
 
03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i did get that from you and i
 
03:14:38.309 --> 03:14:38.319 align:start position:0%
forgot to mention this the last bill
 
03:14:39.190 --> 03:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
that we just
 
03:14:41.429 --> 03:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
looked at we had support from seven
 
03:14:43.590 --> 03:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
opposition for two
 
03:14:44.550 --> 03:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
but i
 
03:14:46.150 --> 03:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
know i'll try to
 
03:14:47.670 --> 03:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
include that with
 
03:14:51.030 --> 03:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
with each bill going forward
 
03:14:55.030 --> 03:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and the last one is i think uh
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
this switching back and forth with exact
 
03:14:58.160 --> 03:14:59.349 align:start position:0%
this switching back and forth with exact
uh

03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
was you know kind of interesting it was
 
03:15:04.630 --> 03:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
good fresh in the memory but at the same
 
03:15:07.190 --> 03:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
time for newbies like me at least for me
 
03:15:09.429 --> 03:15:09.439 align:start position:0%
it was a little
 
03:15:11.269 --> 03:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
quick but you know because there were a
 
03:15:13.750 --> 03:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
few that were totally
 
03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
no opposition that was fine but if it
 
03:15:19.110 --> 03:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
was something that we're gonna do
 
03:15:21.429 --> 03:15:21.439 align:start position:0%
if i know i had a time i would uh
 
03:15:24.950 --> 03:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
prepare better thank you yes i think
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
this was a follow-up i'm trying to be
 
03:15:28.229 --> 03:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
very cautious
 
03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
for those few opportunities where we go
 
03:15:33.269 --> 03:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
to execution right away
 
03:15:36.389 --> 03:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
and uh if anybody objects to that
 
03:15:39.349 --> 03:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh your objection whether it's one or
 
03:15:39.359 --> 03:15:40.229 align:start position:0%
uh your objection whether it's one or
more

03:15:40.229 --> 03:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:15:42.150 --> 03:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
will prevent me from doing that i will
 
03:15:44.150 --> 03:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
not uh try to force
 
03:15:47.190 --> 03:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
executive session unless unless i it's
 
03:15:48.550 --> 03:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
apparent to me that there's no
 
03:15:50.229 --> 03:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
opposition to that
 
03:15:53.110 --> 03:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
um and also consent calendar you've
 
03:15:54.389 --> 03:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
heard me
 
03:15:57.030 --> 03:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh make uh statements about without
 
03:15:59.510 --> 03:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
opposition i'm gonna put this on consent
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
i have
 
03:16:03.349 --> 03:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that when our votes
 
03:16:05.910 --> 03:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
are 18 to 1
 
03:16:09.349 --> 03:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh or 19 to zero if it's if there is
 
03:16:11.429 --> 03:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
more opposition than one committee
 
03:16:13.590 --> 03:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
member then there's not an option to put
 
03:16:15.670 --> 03:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
it in the consent calendar
 
03:16:15.680 --> 03:16:16.550 align:start position:0%
it in the consent calendar
and

03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:18.870 --> 03:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
even if it goes in the consent calendar
 
03:16:20.550 --> 03:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
any one of you
 
03:16:22.630 --> 03:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
actually anybody in the house can
 
03:16:24.150 --> 03:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
request that it be removed from the
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
consent calendar if you want to force a
 
03:16:27.750 --> 03:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
debate on the floor
 
03:16:30.150 --> 03:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
and talk to the bill more than just the
 
03:16:32.070 --> 03:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
consent because for those of you that
 
03:16:34.630 --> 03:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
are new a consent calendar basically
 
03:16:37.269 --> 03:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
puts a bunch of bills that that are
 
03:16:39.190 --> 03:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
pretty much unanimously either supported
 
03:16:40.550 --> 03:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
or opposed
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the in our calendar that has that
 
03:16:45.190 --> 03:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
blue sheet on it we don't haven't had
 
03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
any of those yet because that usually
 
03:16:46.880 --> 03:16:48.309 align:start position:0%
any of those yet because that usually
precedes

03:16:48.309 --> 03:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
precedes
 
03:16:50.790 --> 03:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
a meeting in representative hall or some
 
03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
parking lot somewhere whatever we want
 
03:16:54.070 --> 03:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
to do going forward
 
03:16:54.080 --> 03:16:55.510 align:start position:0%
to do going forward
and

03:16:55.510 --> 03:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:58.469 --> 03:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
then what happens is the speaker asks
 
03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
for a voice vote
 
03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar and all those
 
03:17:03.750 --> 03:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
bills that are in the consent calendar
 
03:17:04.870 --> 03:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
are either
 
03:17:07.110 --> 03:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh accepted or rejected based on what
 
03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
the committee recommended
 
03:17:12.469 --> 03:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
most often uh unanimously
 
03:17:14.710 --> 03:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
so that's just a quick lesson on what
 
03:17:16.469 --> 03:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
that means consent challenge for the new
 
03:17:16.479 --> 03:17:17.590 align:start position:0%
that means consent challenge for the new
folks

03:17:17.590 --> 03:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
folks
 
03:17:20.229 --> 03:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
all right uh next step at hand i have
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:25.269 --> 03:17:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for taking my
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
feedback first i concur with
 
03:17:29.990 --> 03:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative majipudi regarding the
 
03:17:33.190 --> 03:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
blue sheets and my second comment would
 
03:17:35.429 --> 03:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
be this was done to some extent at the
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
beginning of this
 
03:17:40.950 --> 03:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
hearing and meeting um
 
03:17:43.830 --> 03:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
i would um ask prior to going live
 
03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps the zoom moderator could sound
 
03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
check all participants just to make sure
 
03:17:52.309 --> 03:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
that we're clear and audible
 
03:17:56.630 --> 03:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:56.640 --> 03:17:58.150 align:start position:0%
 
feedback

03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
03:18:00.790 --> 03:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from
 
03:18:02.309 --> 03:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
03:18:04.870 --> 03:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
feedback that i've got from other chair
 
03:18:04.880 --> 03:18:06.150 align:start position:0%
feedback that i've got from other chair
persons

03:18:06.150 --> 03:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
persons
 
03:18:07.670 --> 03:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:18:10.150 --> 03:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
their meetings in some cases were more
 
03:18:10.160 --> 03:18:11.110 align:start position:0%
their meetings in some cases were more
bumpy

03:18:11.110 --> 03:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
bumpy
 
03:18:13.190 --> 03:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
than ours was because i think that our
 
03:18:15.030 --> 03:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
assistants have
 
03:18:16.870 --> 03:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
kind of learned the uh
 
03:18:19.830 --> 03:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
the trade here a little bit and uh i get
 
03:18:22.469 --> 03:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
becoming more proficient and i think us
 
03:18:23.830 --> 03:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
as a committee will become more
 
03:18:25.590 --> 03:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
proficient as well
 
03:18:27.990 --> 03:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh as we uh as we tend to use this
 
03:18:31.269 --> 03:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
process and learn from it uh and you get
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
to know me and and iu
 
03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh
 
03:18:39.269 --> 03:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
knowing when you want to speak and uh
 
03:18:40.790 --> 03:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
what you might want to say
 
03:18:42.950 --> 03:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
so uh again
 
03:18:45.030 --> 03:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh i appreciate your feedback and let's
 
03:18:46.469 --> 03:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
hear some more uh
 
03:18:50.630 --> 03:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think i think
 
03:18:54.630 --> 03:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
everything went well even though my
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
computer actually exploded during part
 
03:18:57.510 --> 03:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
of it
 
03:18:57.520 --> 03:18:58.950 align:start position:0%
of it
um

03:18:58.950 --> 03:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:01.510 --> 03:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
i want to follow up on representative
 
03:19:03.269 --> 03:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
manjapudi's uh
 
03:19:05.590 --> 03:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
discussion about the blue sheets
 
03:19:07.510 --> 03:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
when we met in person or when we're all
 
03:19:09.990 --> 03:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
meeting in person uh we can look at the
 
03:19:12.070 --> 03:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
blue sheets and see who has signed up
 
03:19:14.229 --> 03:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
and where they're from
 
03:19:16.309 --> 03:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
and sometimes that helps if it's like a
 
03:19:19.269 --> 03:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
fellow representative or someone from
 
03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
your town or a neighboring town
 
03:19:23.910 --> 03:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
so i don't i know we had one bill that
 
03:19:28.229 --> 03:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
had 47 in in support so i don't want to
 
03:19:30.389 --> 03:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
ask you to please read every name that's
 
03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
on this on the blue sheets but it's but
 
03:19:33.910 --> 03:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
if you could find out if there's some
 
03:19:36.389 --> 03:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
way for us to get the list
 
03:19:38.150 --> 03:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh that everybody's signing up for
 
03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
electronically if they're coming in
 
03:19:39.920 --> 03:19:41.590 align:start position:0%
electronically if they're coming in
remotely

03:19:41.590 --> 03:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
03:19:42.870 --> 03:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
to me
 
03:19:44.710 --> 03:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
prior to the meeting so if i can get
 
03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
them there's no reason why you can't get
 
03:19:46.319 --> 03:19:47.190 align:start position:0%
them there's no reason why you can't get
them

03:19:47.190 --> 03:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:19:48.389 --> 03:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
all right that's right
 
03:19:50.630 --> 03:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
let me see how uh how we would execute
 
03:19:50.640 --> 03:19:52.550 align:start position:0%
let me see how uh how we would execute
that

03:19:52.550 --> 03:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:52.560 --> 03:19:53.590 align:start position:0%
that
uh

03:19:53.590 --> 03:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:19:53.600 --> 03:19:54.950 align:start position:0%
uh
everything

03:19:54.950 --> 03:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:19:54.960 --> 03:19:55.830 align:start position:0%
everything
yeah

03:19:55.830 --> 03:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:20:00.790 --> 03:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:00.800 --> 03:20:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:20:03.429 --> 03:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
representative dan
 
03:20:05.990 --> 03:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
um i was just going to say if you have
 
03:20:08.229 --> 03:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
the sheet physically
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
you can screen share and show it to us
 
03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay yes and you know and what i would
 
03:20:17.349 --> 03:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
do is show it to us and say hey i'm
 
03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
counting and it so that you know because
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to count fast
 
03:20:23.349 --> 03:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
enough to tell who's for and who's again
 
03:20:24.870 --> 03:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
so if you could show us the thing and
 
03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
let us look at it for maybe 30 seconds
 
03:20:30.070 --> 03:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
and say we have 46 people signed in on
 
03:20:33.030 --> 03:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
opposition and 17 signed in and support
 
03:20:34.950 --> 03:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
that might be the easiest way to manage
 
03:20:34.960 --> 03:20:37.030 align:start position:0%
that might be the easiest way to manage
that

03:20:37.030 --> 03:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:20:37.040 --> 03:20:38.309 align:start position:0%
that
representative

03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:20:39.670 --> 03:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's something that
 
03:20:39.680 --> 03:20:40.710 align:start position:0%
that's something that
already

03:20:40.710 --> 03:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:21:01.510 --> 03:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i think the
 
03:21:05.670 --> 03:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
meeting was very well run i want to
 
03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
especially commend you on
 
03:21:11.030 --> 03:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
keeping people to their times especially
 
03:21:12.550 --> 03:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the meeting we sort
 
03:21:14.950 --> 03:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
of got long at the end
 
03:21:19.030 --> 03:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
but i think the not but and i think the
 
03:21:21.750 --> 03:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
comment to the person testifying it you
 
03:21:23.429 --> 03:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
know you have four minutes you have
 
03:21:25.269 --> 03:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
three minutes you have this long and
 
03:21:27.750 --> 03:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
then a warning it solidifies their
 
03:21:29.830 --> 03:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and also
 
03:21:31.510 --> 03:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
lets them know how important their
 
03:21:33.750 --> 03:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
written testimony is as well
 
03:21:36.790 --> 03:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
um i'm with representative porter
 
03:21:39.670 --> 03:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
i'd like to consider that we try asking
 
03:21:42.790 --> 03:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
people who are testifying before us
 
03:21:44.870 --> 03:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
after they've testified
 
03:21:46.710 --> 03:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
a few questions for them and then on to
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
the next person testifying because it
 
03:21:51.670 --> 03:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
does get very confusing as to
 
03:21:53.750 --> 03:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
who said what and who should i ask this
 
03:21:55.830 --> 03:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
question for
 
03:21:58.630 --> 03:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
my third thing is i really like seeing
 
03:22:01.750 --> 03:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
the people who are here at the meeting
 
03:22:03.429 --> 03:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
yet i know there are a few people who
 
03:22:03.439 --> 03:22:04.469 align:start position:0%
yet i know there are a few people who
are

03:22:04.469 --> 03:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:22:07.349 --> 03:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm assuming wrong in the room who
 
03:22:07.359 --> 03:22:08.229 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm assuming wrong in the room who
aren't

03:22:08.229 --> 03:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
03:22:10.229 --> 03:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
on the screen with us
 
03:22:12.229 --> 03:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
um and i don't know if that's because
 
03:22:13.910 --> 03:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have a computer in front of
 
03:22:16.790 --> 03:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
them or an ipad or something like that
 
03:22:18.950 --> 03:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
but i very much like seeing everybody
 
03:22:20.550 --> 03:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i have to commend
 
03:22:24.229 --> 03:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative mcbride on his faithful
 
03:22:26.150 --> 03:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
following of our meeting
 
03:22:30.469 --> 03:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
from his work in his car now to his home
 
03:22:32.469 --> 03:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
very impressive and nice job everybody
 
03:22:34.389 --> 03:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
else thank you
 
03:22:36.229 --> 03:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:38.550 --> 03:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative porter
 
03:22:41.750 --> 03:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair again i i don't i i
 
03:22:43.910 --> 03:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
was uncomfortable not being able to ask
 
03:22:46.870 --> 03:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
questions of a testifier right after
 
03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
they made their testimony
 
03:22:51.269 --> 03:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
um and i might get used to a new way but
 
03:22:53.670 --> 03:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
i would i would feel comfortable if we
 
03:22:56.150 --> 03:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
could try it the other way and let the
 
03:22:58.469 --> 03:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
the committee decide that because we
 
03:23:00.710 --> 03:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
have a lot of new members in this
 
03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:01.750 align:start position:0%
have a lot of new members in this
committee

03:23:01.750 --> 03:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:23:03.429 --> 03:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who might not be
 
03:23:05.750 --> 03:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with the law and the kinds of
 
03:23:08.070 --> 03:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
things that we deal with and they might
 
03:23:12.389 --> 03:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
need clarification on parts of bill's um
 
03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
specific line items and that sort of
 
03:23:16.630 --> 03:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
thing that would be awkward if we had to
 
03:23:18.469 --> 03:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
wait if after the hearing two or three
 
03:23:20.550 --> 03:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
people other than that i thought i
 
03:23:21.990 --> 03:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
thought it went well and
 
03:23:23.670 --> 03:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
it was interesting to see out and hear
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
all the little hums and dings and that
 
03:23:27.030 --> 03:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff so
 
03:23:28.710 --> 03:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for those comments i have made
 
03:23:31.110 --> 03:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
a note and i will work
 
03:23:33.670 --> 03:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
next monday to to do just that
 
03:23:33.680 --> 03:23:35.349 align:start position:0%
next monday to to do just that
uh

03:23:35.349 --> 03:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:23:36.710 --> 03:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
03:23:36.720 --> 03:23:37.990 align:start position:0%
my uh
the

03:23:37.990 --> 03:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:23:40.389 --> 03:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
behavior today by me was
 
03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh driven a little bit by trying to stay
 
03:23:45.750 --> 03:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
on schedule and trying to maintain
 
03:23:46.950 --> 03:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:23:48.550 --> 03:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
the schedule that was published so that
 
03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
we i've i have
 
03:23:52.870 --> 03:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh observed
 
03:23:55.030 --> 03:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh other committee members that
 
03:23:56.790 --> 03:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
other committees that have gone very
 
03:23:59.830 --> 03:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
long several hours past the
 
03:24:01.990 --> 03:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
past day schedule and i certainly don't
 
03:24:04.469 --> 03:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
want to uh
 
03:24:06.309 --> 03:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
have this committee get into that mode
 
03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
so so i'm i'm paying a little bit more
 
03:24:11.190 --> 03:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
into how the meeting being run as
 
03:24:13.110 --> 03:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to the content of the meeting
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
and so your comments are well taken and
 
03:24:17.670 --> 03:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
let's let's experiment a little bit with
 
03:24:19.030 --> 03:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
the other way
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
next monday and see how it's going so
 
03:24:23.990 --> 03:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
just a word of um advice from a former
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
chair and someone who's sat on this
 
03:24:27.510 --> 03:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
committee anything that has to do with
 
03:24:30.870 --> 03:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
dogs or librarians you want to have a
 
03:24:33.750 --> 03:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
long time for them because they all come
 
03:24:39.030 --> 03:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:40.950 --> 03:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
any other comments or critique that
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
you'd like to offer yes uh
 
03:24:46.389 --> 03:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
i would just like to add to
 
03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative porter's list
 
03:24:50.640 --> 03:24:52.389 align:start position:0%
representative porter's list
of

03:24:52.389 --> 03:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:24:54.950 --> 03:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
maybe longer testimony the subject of
 
03:25:01.030 --> 03:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
but but i'd also like to just echo what
 
03:25:05.750 --> 03:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
everybody has said representative dolan
 
03:25:08.710 --> 03:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh i think that this was a exceedingly
 
03:25:11.429 --> 03:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
well-run meeting and um and i think in
 
03:25:13.670 --> 03:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
large part that is due to your efforts
 
03:25:16.070 --> 03:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
as chair so thank you very much well
 
03:25:19.030 --> 03:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you we have uh at least one item
 
03:25:21.349 --> 03:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
of administration
 
03:25:23.110 --> 03:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
to deal with uh
 
03:25:25.510 --> 03:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
we did the exact two bills as you
 
03:25:25.520 --> 03:25:26.630 align:start position:0%
we did the exact two bills as you
remember

03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
remember
 
03:25:30.070 --> 03:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
and when we exec a bill we need to get a
 
03:25:32.950 --> 03:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
majority uh write-up or a minority
 
03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
write-up uh to the output of the bill so
 
03:25:38.309 --> 03:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh i i would
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
actually lean on representative van
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
to write up uh the first bill her first
 
03:25:46.630 --> 03:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
bill as to why we it feed it
 
03:25:50.070 --> 03:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
and then uh we otp another bill and uh
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
john is that something that
 
03:25:53.750 --> 03:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
is your bill i think
 
03:25:56.389 --> 03:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:58.469 --> 03:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair
 
03:25:59.830 --> 03:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
i can write
 
03:26:01.349 --> 03:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
i can write up the
 
03:26:03.349 --> 03:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
blurb for the itl
 
03:26:05.590 --> 03:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
or whatever we're calling them now
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
i know we're not supposed to call them
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
boys i know we're not i'll write up the
 
03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
report and get it to you by tomorrow
 
03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you when you and please
 
03:26:16.950 --> 03:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
also include representative mcdonald's
 
03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
on that distribution of that report okay
 
03:26:22.150 --> 03:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
great and you do you need the vote on it
 
03:26:24.469 --> 03:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
it was 19. it was 18 to 0 because
 
03:26:26.630 --> 03:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
somebody wasn't here yet should i
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
include that in my report
 
03:26:29.910 --> 03:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
that would be fine
 
03:26:32.950 --> 03:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay i can do that
 
03:26:32.960 --> 03:26:36.070 align:start position:0%
okay i can do that
representative

03:26:36.070 --> 03:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:37.910 --> 03:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
i was thinking i was gonna have to go
 
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
home and uh get on my computer to get
 
03:26:43.990 --> 03:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:46.950 --> 03:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'll sit close to the front next time
 
03:26:49.030 --> 03:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
03:26:51.830 --> 03:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
i i agree with uh representative porter
 
03:26:53.110 --> 03:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:26:53.120 --> 03:26:54.389 align:start position:0%
that uh
i

03:26:54.389 --> 03:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
being able to answer questions
 
03:26:58.070 --> 03:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
immediately after the testimony is
 
03:26:59.910 --> 03:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
probably a better way but since you're
 
03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
not bashful about uh telling people to
 
03:27:05.110 --> 03:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
hurry up i think we can stay on schedule
 
03:27:08.469 --> 03:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
right you know so uh i i agree it's a
 
03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
good meeting
 
03:27:10.950 --> 03:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:27:13.429 --> 03:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
those who know me from last year know
 
03:27:15.190 --> 03:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
that i'm not bashful
 
03:27:18.550 --> 03:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
but i also i'm i tend not to be impolite
 
03:27:19.510 --> 03:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:27:21.510 --> 03:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
in that in the bill that we had so many
 
03:27:21.520 --> 03:27:22.550 align:start position:0%
in that in the bill that we had so many
uh

03:27:22.550 --> 03:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:27:26.229 --> 03:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh people testing fine on which was 586
 
03:27:28.389 --> 03:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
we did hear from everybody who had asked
 
03:27:30.229 --> 03:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
to testify which i was surprised that we
 
03:27:31.750 --> 03:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
were able to get them all we went over
 
03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
about an extra half hour
 
03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
03:27:37.190 --> 03:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
we would eliminate some people to a
 
03:27:38.790 --> 03:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
minute to two minutes
 
03:27:41.590 --> 03:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
which i'm sure they wanted more but but
 
03:27:44.150 --> 03:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative porter's comment
 
03:27:45.910 --> 03:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
it shows the importance of written
 
03:27:47.910 --> 03:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
testimony being submitted
 
03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
so that you don't you don't come and
 
03:27:51.990 --> 03:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
testify for 15 minutes if all you're
 
03:27:53.590 --> 03:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
going to do is read us
 
03:27:55.349 --> 03:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
a two or three page single space
 
03:27:57.510 --> 03:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
document it's much better to summarize
 
03:27:59.670 --> 03:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
it in a minute or so and submit it in
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
writing and then we'll have the
 
03:28:02.469 --> 03:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
03:28:03.510 --> 03:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
03:28:05.590 --> 03:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
to take our time and read them as they
 
03:28:06.950 --> 03:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
get submitted
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:28:09.910 --> 03:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's i think that's good feedback so i
 
03:28:11.910 --> 03:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty unanimous that you'd
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
like to uh
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
try a little different way to
 
03:28:17.349 --> 03:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
interrogate those testifying
 
03:28:20.550 --> 03:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
and uh i've made myself a note
 
03:28:23.110 --> 03:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
about that and uh oh i've made notes
 
03:28:24.469 --> 03:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
about all your comments so we'll see
 
03:28:26.710 --> 03:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
what i can do i know i made a note for
 
03:28:29.590 --> 03:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
myself and that we need ac power up here
 
03:28:31.830 --> 03:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
because my computer ran out of juice and
 
03:28:34.150 --> 03:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
there's no place to plug it in so
 
03:28:36.389 --> 03:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
i'll work on getting that fixed
 
03:28:36.399 --> 03:28:37.990 align:start position:0%
i'll work on getting that fixed
uh

03:28:37.990 --> 03:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:28:39.750 --> 03:28:39.760 align:start position:0%

who ahead of this meeting worked with
 
03:28:59.990 --> 03:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
our researcher christina dyer to make
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%

without his diligence
 
03:29:19.750 --> 03:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we would have uh it
 
03:29:21.590 --> 03:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
might not have gone as smoothly so thank

who is our researcher
 
03:29:29.670 --> 03:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
for staying on top of this the entire
 
03:29:32.070 --> 03:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
time yeah i'm confident that
 
03:29:33.750 --> 03:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
by expecting a third meeting we're gonna
 
03:29:36.950 --> 03:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
be flying uh really smooth
 
03:29:38.710 --> 03:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative p monty had a comment
 
03:29:41.030 --> 03:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i have uh one i just wanna know if
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:47.110 --> 03:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
if everybody got the amendments to the
 
03:29:47.120 --> 03:29:49.750 align:start position:0%
if everybody got the amendments to the
bills

03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
bills
 
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
just like anybody not that manchester uh
 
03:29:55.190 --> 03:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
that were spoken operating he did or i
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
was going to do it
 
03:29:56.960 --> 03:29:57.830 align:start position:0%
was going to do it
um

03:29:57.830 --> 03:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:01.429 --> 03:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:03.510 --> 03:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
they were emailed two of them were
 
03:30:05.510 --> 03:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
emailed i got
 
03:30:05.520 --> 03:30:07.429 align:start position:0%
emailed i got
okay

03:30:07.429 --> 03:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:30:09.510 --> 03:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
the thing of it is they're supposed to
 
03:30:12.309 --> 03:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
go through ann fitzgerald upstairs
 
03:30:16.150 --> 03:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
anybody that has a bill and it creates a
 
03:30:17.670 --> 03:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
03:30:18.790 --> 03:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
has to
 
03:30:20.309 --> 03:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
get in touch with her because she's the
 
03:30:22.630 --> 03:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
one that distributes distributed
 
03:30:24.870 --> 03:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
distributes those
 
03:30:27.349 --> 03:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
amendments right and um
 
03:30:29.429 --> 03:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that was just done
 
03:30:32.229 --> 03:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
properly or not right it will certainly
 
03:30:34.950 --> 03:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
slow our executive sessions down if
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
committee members don't have the
 
03:30:38.070 --> 03:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
amendments of being asked to vote on
 
03:30:38.080 --> 03:30:38.950 align:start position:0%
amendments of being asked to vote on
them

03:30:38.950 --> 03:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:30:41.830 --> 03:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh we'll try to make sure that our tech
 
03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
person in this case representative
 
03:30:45.670 --> 03:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
maggiore has them at least so we can
 
03:30:48.309 --> 03:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
screenshot them but i think that that is
 
03:30:50.389 --> 03:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
03:30:51.590 --> 03:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
a minimal
 
03:30:51.600 --> 03:30:52.389 align:start position:0%
a minimal
uh

03:30:52.389 --> 03:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:30:54.229 --> 03:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
solution because it really doesn't give
 
03:30:56.150 --> 03:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
you a chance at a screenshot to read
 
03:30:58.710 --> 03:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
through an amendment that's that's might
 
03:31:01.269 --> 03:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
be uh single spaced and maybe multiple
 
03:31:03.510 --> 03:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
pages long so we'll try to get them in
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
your hands if they're not
 
03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh you know i'll certainly entertain
 
03:31:08.399 --> 03:31:09.670 align:start position:0%
uh you know i'll certainly entertain
uh

03:31:09.670 --> 03:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:31:12.229 --> 03:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
comments from the committee to push to
 
03:31:14.630 --> 03:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
postpone a hearing or an executive
 
03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
session where you don't have the
 
03:31:16.319 --> 03:31:17.670 align:start position:0%
session where you don't have the
documentation

03:31:17.670 --> 03:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
03:31:19.510 --> 03:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
that you need to make the decisions that
 
03:31:21.670 --> 03:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
you're asked to make so
 
03:31:23.830 --> 03:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
we'll work hard on that uh we'll talk
 
03:31:23.840 --> 03:31:24.630 align:start position:0%
we'll work hard on that uh we'll talk
with

03:31:24.630 --> 03:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh especially miss goalie is the
 
03:31:29.279 --> 03:31:30.710 align:start position:0%
uh especially miss goalie is the
um

03:31:30.710 --> 03:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
is the assistant that really handles our
 
03:31:35.750 --> 03:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
documentation more than
 
03:31:38.389 --> 03:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
than dyer uh ms dyer
 
03:31:41.110 --> 03:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
kind of handles the electronic
 
03:31:44.229 --> 03:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
communication and the zoom part of it uh
 
03:31:47.110 --> 03:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
but as far as the documentation goes
 
03:31:50.070 --> 03:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's goalie is the one as she was
 
03:31:52.150 --> 03:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
last year she does usually a very good
 
03:31:53.590 --> 03:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
job so
 
03:31:56.150 --> 03:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
we'll see if we can try to make sure if
 
03:31:58.950 --> 03:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
you if you are missing documentation
 
03:32:01.269 --> 03:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
please please please don't hesitate to
 
03:32:04.150 --> 03:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
say i don't have it i need it
 
03:32:06.070 --> 03:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
03:32:07.750 --> 03:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
because i don't want to put you at risk
 
03:32:09.990 --> 03:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
of having to vote on something that
 
03:32:12.309 --> 03:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
you're not fully informed on
 
03:32:14.309 --> 03:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
so we'll work very hard to make sure you
 
03:32:15.910 --> 03:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
get that or we'll postpone the meeting
 
03:32:19.510 --> 03:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.790 --> 03:32:22.800 align:start position:0%

the state email and every once in a
 
03:32:46.790 --> 03:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
while it goes to the wrong place so
 
03:32:48.790 --> 03:32:48.800 align:start position:0%

03:32:49.910 --> 03:32:49.920 align:start position:0%

committee roster he has a special
 
03:33:03.910 --> 03:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
email that he uses that's his private
 
03:33:06.070 --> 03:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
email rather than his legislative email
 
03:33:07.110 --> 03:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
same with
 
03:33:07.120 --> 03:33:08.070 align:start position:0%
same with
uh

03:33:08.070 --> 03:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative porter and representative

representative porter and representative
gallagher

gallagher
 
03:33:13.750 --> 03:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
use a different email if as well so
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh you can you can always send it to the
 
03:33:17.830 --> 03:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
legislative email but if you really want
 
03:33:20.469 --> 03:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
to get their attention for those three
 
03:33:22.389 --> 03:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
committee members also
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
add in their private email
 
03:33:24.960 --> 03:33:27.590 align:start position:0%
add in their private email
also

03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:27.600 align:start position:0%

03:33:47.590 --> 03:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
this is still being recorded on youtube
 
03:33:49.510 --> 03:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
it might be better for him to email
 
03:33:49.520 --> 03:33:50.389 align:start position:0%
it might be better for him to email
mrs

03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%

03:35:06.399 --> 03:35:07.510 align:start position:0%
mr chair
uh

03:35:07.510 --> 03:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that i got the
 
03:35:11.670 --> 03:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
instructions for the zoning
 
03:35:11.680 --> 03:35:12.790 align:start position:0%
instructions for the zoning
uh

03:35:12.790 --> 03:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:14.790 --> 03:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
do you think that it would be possible
 
03:35:18.150 --> 03:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
that uh you could let us know when we
 
03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
should expect to get the
 
03:35:21.670 --> 03:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
there's no needing instructions so that
 
03:35:21.680 --> 03:35:22.469 align:start position:0%
there's no needing instructions so that
if

03:35:22.469 --> 03:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:35:25.030 --> 03:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
you don't get them that we know that uh
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
they've been
 
03:35:28.309 --> 03:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
they should have been sent out yes uh
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
you you typically get them the day
 
03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
before or two days before
 
03:35:35.030 --> 03:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh i haven't got it
 
03:35:35.040 --> 03:35:36.070 align:start position:0%
uh i haven't got it
today

03:35:36.070 --> 03:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:35:38.790 --> 03:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
before or two days before
 
03:35:40.790 --> 03:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
i should not have to yeah
 
03:35:40.800 --> 03:35:41.590 align:start position:0%
i should not have to yeah
and

03:35:41.590 --> 03:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:43.750 --> 03:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
on typically on friday you get the
 
03:35:45.990 --> 03:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
calendar with uh with the blue sheet on
 
03:35:48.630 --> 03:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
the front i got that uh some of you get
 
03:35:50.790 --> 03:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
electronically some of you if you
 
03:35:53.750 --> 03:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
blocked it in you also get a hard copy
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
the zoom instructions are in the
 
03:35:55.439 --> 03:35:57.429 align:start position:0%
the zoom instructions are in the
calendar

03:35:57.429 --> 03:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
03:35:57.439 --> 03:35:59.349 align:start position:0%
calendar
oh

03:35:59.349 --> 03:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:35:59.359 --> 03:36:00.710 align:start position:0%
oh
so

03:36:00.710 --> 03:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:03.030 --> 03:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
they said they are going to send them
 
03:36:05.030 --> 03:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
well i think you also should be getting
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
an electronic
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
invitation of the panelists to the zoom
 
03:36:12.150 --> 03:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
but if you don't get that with uh then
 
03:36:15.510 --> 03:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
that easily comes the day before
 
03:36:15.520 --> 03:36:17.030 align:start position:0%
that easily comes the day before
because

03:36:17.030 --> 03:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:36:18.309 --> 03:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
many folks
 
03:36:18.319 --> 03:36:19.990 align:start position:0%
many folks
uh

03:36:19.990 --> 03:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:36:21.830 --> 03:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
if you're like me you get so many emails
 
03:36:23.750 --> 03:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
that if you get it a week before it's
 
03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's 40 or 50 emails
 
03:36:28.550 --> 03:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh too low for you to see anymore so
 
03:36:30.710 --> 03:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's usually set the day before but
 
03:36:30.720 --> 03:36:31.429 align:start position:0%
it's usually set the day before but
uh

03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:36:32.710 --> 03:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
let me ask
 
03:36:34.150 --> 03:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
andrea to see if you can help making
 
03:36:39.670 --> 03:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
sure that uh everyone gets the
 
03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
assumed invitation and even if we have
 
03:36:43.990 --> 03:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
to give it several times
 
03:36:45.910 --> 03:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
just take the latest one because they
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
all should be the same yes i believe the
 
03:36:51.429 --> 03:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
zoom invite for that's in the uh
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
calendars is for people who want to
 
03:36:53.520 --> 03:36:54.630 align:start position:0%
calendars is for people who want to
testify

03:36:54.630 --> 03:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
testify
 
03:36:56.550 --> 03:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
because if
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
if you're not a panelist you really
 
03:37:01.269 --> 03:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
can't speak well what happens is uh if
 
03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
you zoom in through that link
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
a tech person here in this case
 
03:37:07.030 --> 03:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative imaginary
 
03:37:07.040 --> 03:37:08.150 align:start position:0%
representative imaginary
uh

03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:10.630 --> 03:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
elevates you to a panelist oh as the
 
03:37:11.910 --> 03:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
meeting starts
 
03:37:14.070 --> 03:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't know that yeah
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
we're not learning that and i have to
 
03:37:17.590 --> 03:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
get elevated to be a
 
03:37:17.600 --> 03:37:18.790 align:start position:0%
get elevated to be a
co-host

03:37:18.790 --> 03:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
co-host
 
03:37:21.190 --> 03:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
so if i have some control as well also i
 
03:37:22.710 --> 03:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
committed some panelists without any
 
03:37:23.990 --> 03:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
control so
 
03:37:25.190 --> 03:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're all learning
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
the nuances of the
 
03:37:29.190 --> 03:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
electronic uh
 
03:37:31.110 --> 03:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it would be so much better
 
03:37:32.870 --> 03:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
if we could do this in person i i think
 
03:37:34.710 --> 03:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
i've been so much more
 
03:37:36.550 --> 03:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
sitting across the lunch table in the
 
03:37:36.560 --> 03:37:37.830 align:start position:0%
sitting across the lunch table in the
cafeteria

03:37:37.830 --> 03:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
cafeteria
 
03:37:39.750 --> 03:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh talking to people about how they feel
 
03:37:42.309 --> 03:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
about things that were unfortunately not
 
03:37:45.030 --> 03:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
getting these days but hopefully keeping
 
03:37:46.790 --> 03:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
our fingers crossed with enough
 
03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinations maybe we can get back to
 
03:37:51.670 --> 03:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
that i get my vaccine today
 
03:37:54.150 --> 03:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
like at least my first shot so
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's good that's because i'm not old
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:20.070 --> 03:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
and i had the appointment about eight
 
03:38:21.990 --> 03:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
days later
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's that fast anymore
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:38.720 --> 03:38:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
lunch

03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
03:38:41.110 --> 03:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
lunch truck
 
03:38:43.030 --> 03:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
no that's fine
 
03:38:45.030 --> 03:38:45.040 align:start position:0%

which i think turned out to be the
 
03:41:36.550 --> 03:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
tuesday after the monday i thought i
 
03:41:38.150 --> 03:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
thought i did
 
03:41:38.160 --> 03:41:44.389 align:start position:0%
thought i did
like

03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:47.189 --> 03:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
my vaccine schedule for tomorrow
 
03:41:49.510 --> 03:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
and because of the snowstorm they
 
03:41:50.790 --> 03:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
they moved in
 
03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
i was gonna they're gonna work on four
 
03:42:02.150 --> 03:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
