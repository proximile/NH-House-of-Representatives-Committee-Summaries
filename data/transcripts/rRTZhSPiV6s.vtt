the senate

this is a bill that's primarily a
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
from the requested by
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
the commission and
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
accordingly i'll go through the
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
different parts of the bill part one
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
changes the term of a charity gaming
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
license from 12 months from issue
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
to annually expiring at the end of each
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
calendar year again that
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
will make housekeeping and managing
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
the licensure uh much easier for
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh the again a lot of the gaming
 
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.670 align:start position:0%
uh the again a lot of the gaming
commission

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh part two expands the definition of
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations for the
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
purposes of issuing charitable gaming
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
bingo and lucky seven
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
licenses um it really
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't expand what it does is it
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
incorporates all of the gaming
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh there are two types basically 27d
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry 287d
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
and 287e uh one deals with lucky seven
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
and bingo
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
the other deals with poker games and
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
what we'll do is
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
is standardize the language between the
 
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.389 align:start position:0%
is standardize the language between the
two

00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh in that sense it is an expansion
 
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.430 align:start position:0%
uh in that sense it is an expansion
because

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
an organization would have to put in for
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
one type of license but wouldn't be
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
qualified for another
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
they'd have to go after the other
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
license separately again it's it is a
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
request of the department
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh part three uh corrects incorrect
 
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.710 align:start position:0%
uh part three uh corrects incorrect
references

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
references
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
to the lottery commission uh where
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
instead it was supposed to be referring
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
to the commission paid
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh on each dollar so incorrectly the
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
lottery had
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
gotten its way in there i don't know
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
whether it was a word processing issue
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
or some other error but that corrects
 
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.509 align:start position:0%
or some other error but that corrects
that

00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
problem uh and then the
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
roman four changes the definition of the
 
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
roman four changes the definition of the
deal

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
deal
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
in references to lucky seven again
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
requested by the
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
the lottery people and uh happy to
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:10.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh senator guida
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused because i
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
think that your definition of the deal
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
contradicts the 1 in 22
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
and it and some of this
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
also overlaps with on
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
i believe it's 25.
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh why weren't all of these just
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
in one bill uh i
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
i can't answer that man uh vice chair i
 
00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:50.790 align:start position:0%
i can't answer that man uh vice chair i
have

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh only again i i deal with the bills
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
that i sponsor
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh as far as amalgamating them into one
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
again prime pearson has the right to
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor a bill and that's i think that's
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
we process look to our esteemed
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the house perhaps to
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
references in section two then
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
are things that are already in one
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
statute or another but we're just
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.839 --> 00:13:48.150 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
thank you does this mean that
 
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh bingo has been been reducing
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
into a a small corner of the charitable
 
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.230 align:start position:0%
into a a small corner of the charitable
gaming

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
world when it used to be the charitable
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
gaming world back in the
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
fire department days on does
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
this make it pretty much sure that
 
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:11.990 align:start position:0%
this make it pretty much sure that
there's

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
only occasionally going to be a game of
 
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.030 align:start position:0%
only occasionally going to be a game of
bingo

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
bingo
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the very back of a large hall of
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
machines and and
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
poker yeah i i'm not sure what it will
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
mean in terms of those parameters
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative again we are what we're
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
is to standardize the language between
 
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.230 align:start position:0%
is to standardize the language between
uh

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
and simplify the process for the
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
that are requesting licenses as far as

the you know
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
what will be the end result i'm not sure
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure anybody can be sure of
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
what it will produce
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
we have charlie mcintyre and the
 
00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:55.350 align:start position:0%
we have charlie mcintyre and the
attendees

and valerie is his partner right
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
are we are we done asking questions uh

questions
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
and uh if santa guy thinks they're
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
better answered by
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
uh director mcintyre that would be fine
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
so on the first page of the bill
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
you're changing the the bill changes
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
the registration with the secretary of
 
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.749 align:start position:0%
the registration with the secretary of
state

00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
requirement to having been registered
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
for at least
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
one year uh changing from a two-year
 
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.629 align:start position:0%
one year uh changing from a two-year
requirement

00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
do you know why that change is being
 
00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:11.590 align:start position:0%
do you know why that change is being
made

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
i would defer to the department
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay the second i'm sorry charlie could
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
charlie actually uh valerie if you would
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
for us sorry enough to keep asking along
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
but valerie if you're on
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
yeah um the change from two years to one
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
year was actually
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
something that was proposed by someone
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
outside of the agency
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
we just wanted the language the
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
definitions of a charitable game
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
charitable organization to match so that
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
we can vet this
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
an organization once rather than twice
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
um but the one the two to one year was
 
00:16:51.199 --> 00:16:51.829 align:start position:0%
um but the one the two to one year was
um

00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
recommended or suggested from somebody
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
all right um so i go on
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
chair major right
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
um the second question is uh
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
on the same page in the uh
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for licensure under this
 
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.390 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for licensure under this
charity

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
charity
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
chapter a charitable
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
shall do all of all of the following
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
then you've got a list one two three and
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
four all of this is new
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
and the fourth one is maintain a current
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
list of bona fiding members
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
i know and i'm sure all of you know that
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
many charities don't have members are
 
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.190 align:start position:0%
many charities don't have members are
not

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
membership organizations and
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
i guess i assume i don't know for sure
 
00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:47.350 align:start position:0%
i guess i assume i don't know for sure
that

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
non-membership charitable organizations
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
participate in
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
my question is isn't that what i just
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
said true and why this additional
 
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.630 align:start position:0%
said true and why this additional
requirement

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
can either charlie or valerie answer
 
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.630 align:start position:0%
can either charlie or valerie answer
that

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
well is this your language this is the
 
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.310 align:start position:0%
well is this your language this is the
language

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
that was originally in um one of the
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
statutes again we're just trying to
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
match them so we can vet
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
the the charity once for all game types
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
um generally if there
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
is just a single member
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
like there's got to be somebody so that
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
member list would probably have one
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
person on it
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's mostly our member list is primarily
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
so that we know
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
um who is authorized
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
okay i think there's a membership uh a
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
drafting issue there
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay so representative names your
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
appointment members or officers or the
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
equivalent of
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
i know that that sounds like what you
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
want to get at but that's
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
if you want to say that you need to say
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
that because uh
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
members bona fide members to
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
get the entire phrase out
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
is a term that has meaning um
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
legally and uh yeah i think you need to
 
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:16.870 align:start position:0%
legally and uh yeah i think you need to
be

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh the language needs to be different
 
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
there are membership
 
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
organizations just to throw one out
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
that's uh a national one
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
is the sierra club is a membership
 
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.990 align:start position:0%
is the sierra club is a membership
charity

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
charity
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
and uh planned parenthood to take
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
another example is not
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh and so forth charlie and valerie is
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
that something you can look into
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
and get resolved i just just want to
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
just clarify one thing one of the
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
reasons why we need the members list
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
is for certain games like bingo and
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
lucky seven
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
only bona fide members are allowed to
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
participate in the operation of the
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
games and so that's what we would use
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.170 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.390 align:start position:0%
sorry
[Music]

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
um you also represent ames
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
no i got a third one go ahead um
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
on the uh this may be an easier one
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
for the lottery um
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
on the deal definition which is on page
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
three at the bottom
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
um there's the
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
this new definition instead of being a
 
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:37.410 align:start position:0%
box or bag
 
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.870 align:start position:0%
box or bag
[Music]

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
the deal becomes a quote single game
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
of uncirculated lucky seven tickets
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
begs the question at least to me what is
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
a single game
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
so a single game of deals of lucky
 
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.029 align:start position:0%
so a single game of deals of lucky
sevens

00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
sevens
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
is a set number of tickets um
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
it can be from currently we have any
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
anywhere up to 3 500 tickets makes a
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
deal that's a single game
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
there are so many winners and so many
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
losers in that deal
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
so whether it comes in a box or a bag is
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
irrelevant what a deal is and if you
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
look at definitions
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
from other states on how they define a
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
deal it's
 
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
that set game with a certain number of
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
winners and losers within that set
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay i'll take that away and chew on it
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have any other questions
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
you're all set representatives i am
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative romney followed
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
by tucker
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
and albany representative brown yeah
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
um i guess this question will be for the
 
00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.390 align:start position:0%
um i guess this question will be for the
lottery

00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
lottery
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh but it appears and this is a
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up to represent
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
ames discussion about who's eligible
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
and obviously the here we go again with
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
the list of
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
internal revenue sections codes it
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
appears that there are six
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
you have to have one of those codes to
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
be eligible as a charity
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
which is consistent if you go to page
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
two in two spots
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
it looks like they just move that around
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
those six
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
exist but they're crossed out because i
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
guess we moved it to this section
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
and then uh that would be line nine
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh eight nine on page two and then again
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
line uh line
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
18 on page two across out because they
 
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.830 align:start position:0%
18 on page two across out because they
move

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
that so it doesn't look like we've we've
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
added or deleted any
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh codes that would make someone
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
eligible a charity eligible
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
although i think what representative
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
ames is saying and
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh representative ames please chime in
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
and correct me if i'm wrong
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
is that now that you look at those codes
 
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.549 align:start position:0%
is that now that you look at those codes
that

00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
there may be other internal revenue
 
00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:09.750 align:start position:0%
there may be other internal revenue
codes

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
codes
 
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
of organizations that actually
 
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.789 align:start position:0%
of organizations that actually
[Music]

00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
are already uh participating in
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
so maybe maybe i can ask dick if that's
 
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.029 align:start position:0%
so maybe maybe i can ask dick if that's
correct

00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i got it yeah um
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
that i don't i don't know i i i don't
 
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:32.870 align:start position:0%
that i don't i don't know i i i don't
know

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
the full extent of each of these irc
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
sections um and uh
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
as you point out i think i haven't
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
looked at it closely but i don't think
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
there's any change in the list
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
no i didn't there isn't yeah you did
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
so it's really a different point that uh
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
is the use of the word members as a
 
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.870 align:start position:0%
is the use of the word members as a
mandatory

00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
um part of what a
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
an organization is supposed to
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
provide um as documentation
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
to the um to the lottery i guess
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to maintain a current list
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
of bona fide a members
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know what that means and i think
 
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.269 align:start position:0%
i don't know what that means and i think
the

00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
statutory language should be a little
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
more complete particularly since you've
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
got this
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
i'd say confusion or
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
this other source of authority for
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
charities that
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
that uses the concept of membership in a
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
different way
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
okay can charlie react to that uh mr
 
00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:48.950 align:start position:0%
okay can charlie react to that uh mr
chair

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
yeah of course certainly um i think
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative ames brings up a good
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
point is the
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
the what is sentence for of that section
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
related to bona fide members and can be
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
worked on but otherwise there'd be no
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
changes to it
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
from where we would see it yeah that's
 
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.870 align:start position:0%
from where we would see it yeah that's
fine

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you almost mr chair thank you
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh zen tucker yes uh
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
i think we've all missed representative
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
griffin i want to make sure
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
that she is satisfied with the language
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
as presented
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i count on her for
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
her special knowledge could she comment
 
00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:30.390 align:start position:0%
her special knowledge could she comment
police

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
maybe she needs reminding about how to
 
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:42.950 align:start position:0%
maybe she needs reminding about how to
you

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
are unmuted representative griffin you
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and yes i am following i'm
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
really very closely attuned to what's
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
in the gambling i i i'm following it
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
along and i'm not having a problem at
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that you're
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
happy uh
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
well i'll be happy if i if it comes out
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
may i just remind you to to hit star
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
nine to raise your hand
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
yes i will do that thank you dear we'll
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on i'm not sure
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
that representative griffin has seen the
 
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.990 align:start position:0%
that representative griffin has seen the
bill

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
yet uh she hadn't yesterday
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh so um i would like
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
to ask about two things one of them
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
is we retained another bill because
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
we were unclear about what's
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
in all of these irc codes
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
and wanted to think about it more this
 
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.029 align:start position:0%
and wanted to think about it more this
summer

00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
summer
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
and bundling everything together at this
 
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.029 align:start position:0%
and bundling everything together at this
point

00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
so that it covers all of
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
bingo and charitable gaming on is
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
something i think
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be more we need to look at this
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
language very carefully
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
across all of the provisions that
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
that are here and
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's dealing with
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
with the sections one to four part
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
and on i'm not
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
sure myself about this one to two years
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
to have a bona fide charity that and
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
what is involved in being actually
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
registered with the
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
secretary um the secretary of state or
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
secretary of state um
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
anybody can register anything with the

don't
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand if there is
 
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.110 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand if there is
any

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
on if it is registered with the

ag's charitable or um
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
charitable division that's one thing but
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
if it's registered with the secretary of

if it's registered with the secretary of
state

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
that seems like an extremely i could
 
00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.750 align:start position:0%
that seems like an extremely i could
register

00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
register
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%

and they wouldn't notice what was going
 
00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.470 align:start position:0%
and they wouldn't notice what was going
on

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
at least that's the way it has been and
 
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.070 align:start position:0%
at least that's the way it has been and
the

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
the final thing that i wanted
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.070 align:start position:0%
now if you're interested it won't take
long

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
501c3 is a charity organization
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
501c4 social welfare organizations such
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%

to members
 
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
501c10 is fraternal organizations such
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
and 501c19 are veterans organizations
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
so those would be as defined in the in
 
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.950 align:start position:0%
so those would be as defined in the in
the

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
the the dark language in section number
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
yes and um
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
as far as the deal the 3500 is defined
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
in statute at present
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
there is some legislation that is moving
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
forward to change that number
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
but at president is statutorily defined
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
as 3500.
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman could i um
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
point out to senator guida that
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
501c4 is also the code for
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
fine um
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
i think we need to go on
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
next is representative hacken phillips
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh i just wanted to pick up on
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
what representative ames was stating
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
before in regards to some
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
non-profit charities that when they
 
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.190 align:start position:0%
non-profit charities that when they
become

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
formed have the option to select formal
 
00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.549 align:start position:0%
formed have the option to select formal
membership

00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
or no formal membership in the original
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
formation process at the secretary of
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
state's office
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
there are many educational medical
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
scientific society
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
um type nonprofit organizations that
 
00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:07.750 align:start position:0%
um type nonprofit organizations that
select

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
select
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
not to have formal membership or
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
employees and to strictly function
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
as a public good so they do not have
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
formal membership
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
in that formation process therefore they
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
would not qualify under this definition
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
for that bona fide membership as it
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
stands here
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
in my legal opinion um so
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
my concern is that you know you would be
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
excluding several very worthy charitable
 
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.149 align:start position:0%
excluding several very worthy charitable
organizations

00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
just from this change and i would you
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
know bring that to your attention and
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
just ask you
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
you know why you would intend to exclude
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
you want to respond either senator
 
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:48.549 align:start position:0%
you want to respond either senator
geider

00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
geider
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
or valerie or i think there's certainly
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
no intent to exclude anyone
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
and i i would welcome any change to that
 
00:32:55.679 --> 00:32:56.789 align:start position:0%
and i i would welcome any change to that
uh

00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
that uh part of this legislation that's
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
proposed i'd certainly welcome a change
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
that makes it more inclusive uh and
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
uh enables such organizations uh if they
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
so desire to participate
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
valerie do you have anything to add to
 
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.029 align:start position:0%
valerie do you have anything to add to
that

00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to point out that a
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
bona fide member
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
is defined in the in the statute
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
under the definition section also it's
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
referred throughout the statute
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
so if you do make a change you're going
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
to have to make changes throughout
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
again the intent is we need to know who
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
is authorized to participate because
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
the statute for lucky seven and
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
bingo limit who can actually
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
operate the games to bona fide members
 
00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.070 align:start position:0%
operate the games to bona fide members
so

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
it would require a significant change to
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
charlie did you have anything to add no
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
no that was what i was going to suggest
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
as well is that um we have defined that
 
00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.269 align:start position:0%
as well is that um we have defined that
already

00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
and we need to make changes through the
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
law if we change it here as well
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
okay are you all set representative
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
all right and we'll go to uh
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um back to the whole
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
issue of the secretary of state
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
uh being registered with the secretary
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
of state that's incurred statute there's
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
nothing changed there
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
so my question for charlie um
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
mcintyre is how does that process work
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
uh charity wants to get involved the
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
does the lottery commission get involved
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
double check that they're also
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
registered with the secretary of state
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
or does can you
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
just uh clarify that for me yeah we do
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
um certainly uh valerie does check with
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office to
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
confirm that they've been
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
registered with there for the past two

years um
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
and that there is a process by which
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
they do disclose information the center
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
states office val if you want to
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
yeah we can actually go on the secretary
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
of state's website
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
to confirm and we do especially if we
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
have the number
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
the registration number we can easily
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
confirm that they're still in good
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
standing with secretary of state
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%

susan you're muted i know it's very
difficult

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes to get my laptop to unmute
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
um even
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
on could we when before we finish
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with this bill
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
talk to the secretary of state's
 
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.109 align:start position:0%
talk to the secretary of state's
registration

00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
office about how they're handling these
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
now because
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
it used to be that you would just walk
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
in and fill out a form
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
and you were all of a sudden the company
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
or or i don't know whether there's a
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
separate one
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
for charitable organizations
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
but there was no follow-up
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
at all and
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
and we've had cases on the condominium
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
side that i i work on where
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
on people would register and
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
unregister as condominium or homeowner
 
00:36:40.599 --> 00:36:42.230 align:start position:0%
unregister as condominium or homeowner
organizations

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
on at will without on
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
without the board of these of the
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
organization knowing it had been done
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.589 align:start position:0%
and and um
[Music]

00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
we're or without the the people in the
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
association knowing that they were an
 
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.109 align:start position:0%
association knowing that they were an
association

00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
so i would like to have a conversation
 
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
with the secretary of state's office to
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
see whether this actually means anything
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
we can arrange to have somebody from the
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:21.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um just this is just a quick
 
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.190 align:start position:0%
thank you um just this is just a quick
comment

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh that um
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
i think first there's confusion because
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
we've got several
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
bills before us this morning
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with the same subject and
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
overlapping and we've got two of them
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
right in this
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
hearing space right now but there's
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
two others that deal with uh lucky seven
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
or games of chance um and we're going to
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
have to put them together i mean it
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
what we've got before us right now uh so
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's a task ahead of us i think
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
and then on this question of membership
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
i think it's all i want to say is i
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
think it's easily resolved
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and the uh the phrase
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
maintain a current list of bona fide
 
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.030 align:start position:0%
maintain a current list of bona fide
members

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in the eligibility section
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
which is where it is right now there
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
should be a separate requirement if
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
if there should be such a requirement
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'll take that as
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
as given since that's what you require
 
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.190 align:start position:0%
as given since that's what you require
now

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
and and say separately that
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
in the appropriate place that a
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
charitable organization
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh participating in uh this
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
process uh shall maintain a list of
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
bona fide members as defined in such and
 
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.030 align:start position:0%
bona fide members as defined in such and
such

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
such
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
section of the statute that sort of
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
takes care
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
of the problem since it is a defined
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
term as
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
has been pointed out so uh that's all i
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
had to say that's a comment not a
 
00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.310 align:start position:0%
had to say that's a comment not a
question

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
all right uh valerie you rub your hand
 
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.390 align:start position:0%
all right uh valerie you rub your hand
up

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
valerie do you have anything else yes
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
i um i just wanted to have two things
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
um representative ames makes a good
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
point i just want to make sure that if
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
you remove it from one you remove it
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
from both
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
because the the whole point of this
 
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.030 align:start position:0%
because the the whole point of this
proposed

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
language is so that they match each
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
other between lucky seven and
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
games of chance bingo the other thing i
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to let uh representative all
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
me know that
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
the reason why we use secretary of state
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
is more for
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that they've been in in
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
existence and are a new
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know their they're they can do
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
business in new hampshire
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
so that's that's mostly what we use
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
secretary of state for is just to
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
confirm that they are a new hampshire
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
business and registered to to do
 
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
business in new hampshire
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
and that they've been in existence for
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay for one year
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
but there's one more uh
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative elliott
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
all right it's for this is uh for
 
00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:21.030 align:start position:0%
all right it's for this is uh for
valerie

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
valerie
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh king did you say that
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
quote a bona fide member unquote
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
bona fide member is already uh defined
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
in statute under rsa
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
287 e1 roman numeral
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
two um uh roman numeral three
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
so that's in the statute already it's
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
not part of the bill
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
so it's already in the bill thank you
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay since saying no other hands i'm
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
going to ask senator geider
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
what's the primary difference between
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 20 i mean senate bill 27
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
and senate bill 22
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh that's an excellent question mr
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and at this point i
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
i i'd have to get back to you on that
 
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.510 align:start position:0%
i i'd have to get back to you on that
okay

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
and that is rick newman and i think he's
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
in attendance

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
and i notice it says zero minutes so
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%

newman
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
and representing new hampshire
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators association
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 27 i will be brief
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh i did just want to say that um for
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
instance uh
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
section one section one is a change to
 
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:24.870 align:start position:0%
section one section one is a change to
go

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
back to what it used to be it used to be
 
00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.030 align:start position:0%
back to what it used to be it used to be
that

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
in games of chance poker rooms um
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
the licenses for charities were good
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
until december 31st
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
a few years ago that was changed to make
 
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:40.870 align:start position:0%
a few years ago that was changed to make
them

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh run for 12 months and that's caused a
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
with uh you know the people who licensed
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
charities in the rooms and with the
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
lottery so we feel that's a an excellent
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
change to re
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
return to what used to be um
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
that that really is a housekeeping
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
measure uh but it will uh
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
save a lot of headaches for a lot of
 
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.470 align:start position:0%
save a lot of headaches for a lot of
people

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
um section two the uh
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
the the various 501 c3s uh senator gaida
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
went through those
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is all that's
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
happening there
 
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
is that currently though that list
 
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.670 align:start position:0%
is that currently though that list
exists

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
in 287e the bingo statute
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
and it's now being replicated in 287d
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh the games of chance poker room statue
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
again to make it uh the same between
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
both statutes
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
um i'd like the issue of the
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh deal uh definition um
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
this was something that the
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules committee asked for
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
about four years ago
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
maybe later that this be addressed
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
current deal definition is simply
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
outdated it says bag or box
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
and that's not the way deals of lucky
 
00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.750 align:start position:0%
and that's not the way deals of lucky
sevens

00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
sevens
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
really come exclusively anymore and so
 
00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.270 align:start position:0%
really come exclusively anymore and so
that

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
deal definition doesn't have any
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
implications beyond the fact that
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
it is recognizing that the
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh the this new deal language will in
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
fact comport to what is happening in the
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
in the marketplace um
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
and and the issue about the membership
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
to representative ames
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
issue um i i do know perhaps
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
ms king can address this i know that
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
currently there are
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
charities for instance i've run into it
 
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.109 align:start position:0%
charities for instance i've run into it
with

00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh little leagues uh where you don't
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
really have a member
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh but there are little leagues that
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
participate in charity gaming
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i think they've accommodated that in
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
some ways by
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh i think in the case of little leagues
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
for instance they have
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh they use the parents of the kids who
 
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.270 align:start position:0%
uh they use the parents of the kids who
participate

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh but that language bona fide members
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
is in the current 2017
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
it looks new because it's being added to
 
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.710 align:start position:0%
it looks new because it's being added to
287d

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
287d
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
again for the reason to just have the
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
same language in both statutes
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
um but it's really it's not new
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
and one final point uh to representative
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
almey's point about
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh how easy it is to register at
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and that's absolutely
 
00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.109 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and that's absolutely
accurate

00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
um but i would point out that it's not
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
just registering with secretary of state
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
that makes a charity eligible um you
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
also have to be the charities so you
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
you know uh registered under one of
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
these 501 c
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
threes and have a letter from the irs
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh and then in addition to that you
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
register with the secretary of state new
 
00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.230 align:start position:0%
register with the secretary of state new
hampshire

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
to as ms king pointed out to demonstrate
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
that you are a new hampshire-based
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
charity with that mr chairman i
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony we do support this
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill this morning mr newman
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
we take questions i will uh
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative early
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you it's uh i was having a hard
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
time getting uh
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
onto the internet for some reason or
 
00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.349 align:start position:0%
onto the internet for some reason or
another

00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
at any rate uh regarding membership
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
lists etc the knights of columbus
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
particularly down in salem
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh do a large amount of uh fundraising
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
using gaming lists of memberships are
 
00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.069 align:start position:0%
using gaming lists of memberships are
not

00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
possible from a 501c8 such as the
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
knights of columbus
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
um that's going to be a bit of a problem
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
and then in addition your uh
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list that
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
senator geider read out did not include
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
the masons
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the masons are engaged in gaming
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
they're 501 c
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
10. um they're
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes making a laundry list of who
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
can participate and who can't
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
um creates issues uh
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
there's some problems with both of these
 
00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:00.950 align:start position:0%
there's some problems with both of these
bills

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
in trying to clarify they've actually
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
muddied the waters
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
as far as i see so far excuse me i got a
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
frog on my throat
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
but i i would point out i agree with you
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative ulri
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
of 501c10s are listed and the masons are
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
one of those groups or a number of
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
groups i don't think
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
um every one of them was was mentioned
 
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.430 align:start position:0%
um every one of them was was mentioned
but

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
yes a 501 c 10 would include a masons
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
the knights of columbus
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
several other types of organizations
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
that come under that
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
um that is on current law as i
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
understand and it is currently
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
the list that exists in rsa287e
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
and it's simply by this bill being uh
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
added to 287d
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of making both statutes
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
yes i i understand that uh mr newman
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
but the uh the situation is when you
 
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.030 align:start position:0%
but the uh the situation is when you
start

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
asking for lists of members you're
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
getting into
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh territory where you're asking for uh
 
00:48:07.599 --> 00:48:08.150 align:start position:0%
uh territory where you're asking for uh
uh

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
confidential information people join uh
 
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:11.430 align:start position:0%
confidential information people join uh
or

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
the masons are much more secret than the
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
knights are
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
now at this point but their membership
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
lists are not public
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
ours are not public there's been
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
incidents uh
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
where publicly have been made are being
 
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:26.950 align:start position:0%
where publicly have been made are being
privately

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
privately
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
been made public uh either through uh
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh hacking operations or inattention of
 
00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:34.150 align:start position:0%
uh hacking operations or inattention of
uh

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies i hate to say that to you
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
charlie but
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
your bureaucracy um
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
that's a bit of an issue for uh the
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
knights of columbus
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
is getting involved with registering
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
with the secretary
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
of state and or the uh
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
charitable um division and i agree the
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
secretary of state doesn't fall through
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
it much
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
unless you know our corporation and they
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
want their money every
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
april okay
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
rep senator brownlee uh yes thank you mr
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
chair uh
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
mr newman um when it comes to this
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
current statutes to forget about these
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
this this bill
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
is there any provision for exceptions to
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh that that you're aware of and i'll
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
ask the same question of
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
of uh miss king or uh or charlie
 
00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.390 align:start position:0%
of uh miss king or uh or charlie
mcintyre

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
mcintyre
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
as well well i i know for instance and
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sure valerie answered this better
 
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
but i do know for instance the tilted
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
little league is one
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
where you don't have members per se but
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
i know they participate in charities
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh charity gaming so um i
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
i guess the answer is they must have
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
some provisions where they allow
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know so-called non-member
 
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.109 align:start position:0%
uh you know so-called non-member
charities

00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
charities
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh to participate they must give them i
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
believe with the case of little leagues
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
they give the parents
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
um as far as who's considered a member
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
we basically we feel that the charity
 
00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.549 align:start position:0%
we basically we feel that the charity
determines

00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
determines
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
what makes somebody eligible for
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
membership i mean
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
the statute does say they have to be a
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
member for at least 60 days but it's
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
really the
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
charities criteria on what they consider
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
membership to be
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
so we don't go any deeper than
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
them providing a list of who they
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
consider their members to be so that we
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
can confirm that only those
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
individuals are participating in the
 
00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:41.270 align:start position:0%
individuals are participating in the
operations

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
but follow up mr chair
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
so valerie um so but they would have to
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's no exception to the ir internal
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
revenue codes that are here so
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
are we saying that little league falls
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
we have had little leagues as charitable
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
organizations so i assume
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
that they do i'm not sure which one okay
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm set mr chair
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um so uh
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
mr newman the question is the first
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh whether you know why the move from
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
two years to one year
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
for the registration requirement
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't i remember that
 
00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:37.910 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't i remember that
somebody

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
i ran into that problem and i i honestly
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
don't recall who it was i don't recall
 
00:51:42.319 --> 00:51:42.790 align:start position:0%
don't recall who it was i don't recall
who

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
asked for that okay so far we've got a
 
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
change that nobody can explain
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's just a comment um
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
and in terms of this membership issue
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking of a local charity that's
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
here in
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
jeffrey and in the monadnock region
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
that's called monadnock at home that's a
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful charity serving
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
homeless people it's not a membership
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
organization i don't think they'd
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
know what to say if you asked who are
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
your members i know they
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
they considered they do not
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
participate but they considered
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
participating in charitable games as a
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
way of
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
maybe raising some money and have chosen
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
not to but if they
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
chose to pursue it i think they'd be
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
confounded by this
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
way as presented now in this bill as a
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
prerequisite for being eligible
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
yeah no i i totally can understand that
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
and i think um
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
accommodations should be made there are
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
probably a lot of charities that fall
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
into that
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
um the only thing i can say is that you
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
know 287 e requires the list of
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
charities for the reasons that valerie
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
has said which is
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
that in that case only charities can
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
operate bingo
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
um 287d of course is different because
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
games of chance poker rooms
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
are operated by game operators so that
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
charity operation requirement is not in
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
that statute
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
um and i i i totally agree with you i
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
think that's probably something that
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be dealt with
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
so just to comment on in response my
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
takeaway is that
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
we just need to be careful here we need
 
00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
we're not unintentionally excluding
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
organizations that should be excluded i
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
think the challenge is to look at the
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
both the the references to the federal
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh categories for a charitable
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
organization make sure that we've got
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
got that down right and then use the
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
representing yours
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this is a question
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
for charlie mcintyre
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
have you given any thought to uh
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
expanding the list of of uh
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
codes here or or a mechanism to
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
formally do exemptions to that list to
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
include other
 
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
charities we have we have actually to
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
appoint representative abrami we have
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh we receive requests from charities
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
that are registered with a charitable
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
trust division of the ag's office but
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
not registered secretary of state's
 
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.829 align:start position:0%
not registered secretary of state's
office

00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
and um so the answer is yes so
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
if if possible
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
mr chairman major if we could look at
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
the language and
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
respond to it in kind um i think we can
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
clean this up
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
with a re-drafting if that makes sense
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
we don't have to just go out for a while
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
so we'll have the time to do that
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay so certainly to address that
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
question as well as
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
represent representative ames issue
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
regarding membership which is
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
i think we've been doing the work around
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
here in terms of what qualifies as
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
membership but
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
to further refine it is probably a good
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
checking with the secretary of state's
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
office and the attorney general's office
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
bringing those types of charities
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
together so everybody's
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
voted if you can solve that that's going
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
to help
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes sir all right uh
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and as a suggestion
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh from
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
from what miss king had just uh stated
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
you don't really want a list of members
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
you just want a list of contact persons
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
so having just a list of contact persons
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
using languages to
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote authorized persons
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
is what you're looking for is that
 
00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:13.190 align:start position:0%
is what you're looking for is that
correct

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
you want to respond to that valerie or
 
00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.589 align:start position:0%
you want to respond to that valerie or
kali

00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
kali
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's essentially correct
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
and whether
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
as as uh as has been mentioned earlier
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
if you if it were removed from the
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
statute as a requirement that would be
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
fine because we can still require in
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
rules that they provide us with the list
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
of people that are
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
um authorized to participate
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
yeah very good
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that mr chair yes
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is uh
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
authorized to participate well what do
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
you mean participate
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
because uh for example bishop guertin
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
runs bingo at one of the halls to
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
collect money for
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh bishop guertin and that rotates
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
amongst the parents
 
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:06.470 align:start position:0%
amongst the parents
so

00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
who's so who's an authorized person
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's like representative ames comment
 
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:13.109 align:start position:0%
it's like representative ames comment
about

00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
his his local uh uh uh charity up there
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
for the town i mean we're we're getting
 
00:57:19.119 --> 00:57:20.069 align:start position:0%
for the town i mean we're we're getting
into

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think we've beaten this to death we
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
know what the issue is
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
it needs to be worked out with a
 
00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:27.510 align:start position:0%
it needs to be worked out with a
solution

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
and let's wait for that solution thank
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
anything new uh representative
 
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:39.030 align:start position:0%
anything new uh representative
elementary

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um i
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
um did want to bring up something that
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
we haven't discussed yet
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
on hey on the first page
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
line 16-17
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
what does it mean or is covered under a
 
00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:00.069 align:start position:0%
what does it mean or is covered under a
group

00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
ruling issued by the internal revenue
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
service under the authority of those
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
sections on
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
would that mean that um anybody who
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to create a scam charity
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
could um register themselves
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
on with you on saying
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
that you were a little league or
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
on in a small town
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh that um and
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
do you use these this language and
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
this is to valerie or charlie
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
um so the the group ruling is really
 
00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:45.589 align:start position:0%
um so the the group ruling is really
just

00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's they have their irs
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
um their non-profit status is
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
under a an umbrella so like
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
miss america may be the the head one but
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
they have all these
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
other local miss americas so those
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
little ones are under the big one that's
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's just uh an affiliation okay
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
so if the new hampshire guns of america
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
firm whatever that thing is called guns
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
for america or every town
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
gun sense on the new hampshire
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
group if they've got a c4
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
then the new hampshire group would be
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
considered under
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
their original irs license that's all
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you we've
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
spent a long a lot of time on this we're
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
going to have a work session
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
and people are going to come back with
 
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
some solutions
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
so anything else if not i'm closing
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other hand closing the
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
public area on
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill 27 and just go back to
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
22. senate bill 22
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
has the same title it's um
 
01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:11.190 align:start position:0%
has the same title it's um
but

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
three looks like small sections but
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
a small section could be really big
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to go into the public
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 22
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
we have taylor uh
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
he's opposed four o'clock uh
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
mark do you want me to introduce the
 
01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.270 align:start position:0%
mark do you want me to introduce the
bill

bill
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
let's introduce the bill what's up
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
no one has to introduce the bill all
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
okay so we don't have a sponsor here
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
so you won't want to introduce the bill
 
01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:02.630 align:start position:0%
so you won't want to introduce the bill
yeah

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%

01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
for four years i've sat next to
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
representative mary griffin
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
who has my left ear most of the time
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
and on line two says lucky seven tickets
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
may be sold by dispenser devices
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
and then when we go down to lines 15
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
through 17.
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
does this mean that representative
 
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.150 align:start position:0%
does this mean that representative
griffin

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
griffin
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
seniors will still be able to get a
 
01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.270 align:start position:0%
seniors will still be able to get a
paper

01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
paper
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
ticket handed to them so that they can
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
open it close it whatever they want to
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
do or will
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
certainly that's to the decision of the
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
operator but dispensers will still be
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh available if the bingo hall still
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
sells that way there are
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
electronic machines which sell lucky
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
seven and then there are physical
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
dispensers which dispense lucky seven
 
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.950 align:start position:0%
dispensers which dispense lucky seven
tickets

01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
very um not sophisticated
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
um and so the answer is yes
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
director mcintyre on lines 11-13
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh we've been told that a deal is 3 500
 
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.109 align:start position:0%
uh we've been told that a deal is 3 500
tickets

01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
now i see the the addition the
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
commission shall not authorize deal
 
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.510 align:start position:0%
commission shall not authorize deal
sizes

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
sizes
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
over 14 000 tickets can you explain this
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh what this deal means yeah it does a
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
few things right so
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
um whenever you increase the pool size
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
of a game
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
just think of it like a pyramid you can
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
increase the top of the pyramid
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
not a good term but go ahead
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
the top prize can be raised also for
 
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:47.829 align:start position:0%
the top prize can be raised also for
example

01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's a consumer for us for certainly for
 
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.190 align:start position:0%
it's a consumer for us for certainly for
me

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
i think it's a consumer benefit only
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
because if the top prize in an existing
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
deal of 3500
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
4500 3500 tickets is 500
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
and that prize is gone then in theory
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
we're offering something to the public
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
for sale that doesn't exist anymore
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
as a top prize but increasing the deal
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
size allows more prizes of that level to
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
so i mean certainly it's not that
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
significant to change if you look at a
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
lottery ticket for example
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
we have pool sizes that are five million
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
um some of our tickets so the 1400 14
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
000 is not that large a pool size for a
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
gambling product thank you director
 
01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.630 align:start position:0%
gambling product thank you director
mcintyre

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
mcintyre
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
have rick newman testify first
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
and rick newman is a lobbyist
 
01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
from grover gaming in support of the
 
01:04:53.039 --> 01:04:54.950 align:start position:0%
from grover gaming in support of the
bill

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and just to
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
clarify i'm representing
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
the um uh
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
yes grover gaming on this bill um
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
and uh i am testifying in support the
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
first thing i'd like to ask the
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
committee to focus on is
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
this bill deals with a different
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
universe of charities
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
than you have dealt with for instance
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
when you were dealing with
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
historic races this bill deals with
 
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
charities that sell
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
lucky seven tickets those are primarily
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
sold in new hampshire at clubs at places
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
like bfw's
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
american legions you know um
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
elks clubs those kinds of places there
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
are about
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
11 or 12 commercial bingo halls
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that also sell lucky
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
seven tickets
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
but there are over 200 other locations
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
such as what i just mentioned where
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
lucky seven tickets are sold
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
so um this is the so it's a different
 
01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.589 align:start position:0%
so um this is the so it's a different
universe

01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
universe
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
of charities um
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
the first change in the current law
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
is relative to electronic dispensing
 
01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:12.710 align:start position:0%
is relative to electronic dispensing
devices

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
the the current law requires that in
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
every case a ticket must be
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
printed this bill would allow that to be
 
01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:20.390 align:start position:0%
printed this bill would allow that to be
an

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
option this is important to the
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
charities because
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
the rolls of paper that print those
 
01:06:26.079 --> 01:06:26.950 align:start position:0%
the rolls of paper that print those
tickets

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh cost money that money is paid for by
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
the charities and if it can be made
 
01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.190 align:start position:0%
the charities and if it can be made
optional

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
optional
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
it will be less cost the fact of the
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
matter is
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
people who play electronic dispensing
 
01:06:39.359 --> 01:06:40.549 align:start position:0%
people who play electronic dispensing
devices

01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
simply don't care whether a ticket is
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
printed or not
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
they don't look at those tickets they
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
can see the results on the screen
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
on the video monitor and the
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
winnings kept track on the video monitor
 
01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:55.990 align:start position:0%
winnings kept track on the video monitor
so

01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
they don't need the ticket to cash out
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
they don't look at the ticket they don't
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
need the ticket to know whether they
 
01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:01.990 align:start position:0%
need the ticket to know whether they
want

01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
it is really a waste of time
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
um i will point out to you for instance
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
this past summer
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
there was literally a time when the
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
paper that is required for these
 
01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.309 align:start position:0%
paper that is required for these
machines

01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
was simply not available because of
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
covid the
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturer had shut down there's only
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
one manufacturer
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
that makes this double-sided
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
roll of paper that's required of these
 
01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.670 align:start position:0%
roll of paper that's required of these
machines

01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
and so it created a problem for
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
charities throughout the state
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
because the paper was simply not
 
01:07:36.079 --> 01:07:37.589 align:start position:0%
because the paper was simply not
available

01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
making it optional makes sense for the
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
environment makes sense for charities so
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
i hurt you to consider that this is a
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
requirement in the statute
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
that is simply not needed um
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
the other change that's made here is
 
01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.150 align:start position:0%
the other change that's made here is
that

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's actually this is actually a twofold
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
change you've asked a lot about the 3500
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
ticket uh maximum and deals how that's
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh currently provided for the current
 
01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.789 align:start position:0%
uh currently provided for the current
statute

01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
says that the lottery decides how big
 
01:08:09.599 --> 01:08:10.390 align:start position:0%
says that the lottery decides how big
ticket

01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
the deals are so if lottery tomorrow
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to change the current 3 500
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
maximum deal size to 14 000 or 50
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
000 the current statute gives them that
 
01:08:24.239 --> 01:08:25.349 align:start position:0%
000 the current statute gives them that
authority

01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
this change puts that authority back in
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
the hands of the legislature
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
by by maximizing the deal size of 14
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
000 that lottery can approve
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
if at any time there was an effort to go
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
beyond 14 000 it would require
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
further legislative action so i would i
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
would point out that that
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
i think is a benefit and
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
the question of why 14 000 is chosen i
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
will tell you is this
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
under the current rules set by lottery
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
um each charity as i said has a maximum
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
a deal size they can use of 3 500
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
but they are allowed to commingle four
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
deals in one
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
box whether that's a physical box at an
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
american legion
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
where four deals are put together in a
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
box or in a
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
mechanical dispensing device or whether
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's an electronic
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
game where the electronic game can
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
choose from
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
four separate deals at the same time so
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
a total of 14
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
000 tickets are currently allowed to be
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
co-mingled if you will um
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
by making the ability to have a deal
 
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:42.870 align:start position:0%
by making the ability to have a deal
size

01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
size
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
at 14 000 as mr mcintyre said
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
you increase the amount of prizes
 
01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.349 align:start position:0%
you increase the amount of prizes
available

01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
which we obviously believe will attract
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
more players
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason for that request
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
and one final thing i will say is in the
 
01:09:59.040 --> 01:09:59.910 align:start position:0%
and one final thing i will say is in the
senate

01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
um the senate added if you recall last
 
01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.310 align:start position:0%
um the senate added if you recall last
year

01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
um you changed the uh ticket price
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
maximum from 50 cents to a dollar
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
that stays the same in this bill you
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
also had a requirement
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
that said if you're going to sell a
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
dollar ticket
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
you have to have a 50 cent ticket
 
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.030 align:start position:0%
you have to have a 50 cent ticket
available

01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
um for representative griffin wanted
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
and we certainly supported it you folks
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
put it in the law
 
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
but inadvertently the language
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
meant that no longer could 25 cent
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
tickets be
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
sold so the senate added 25 cent tickets
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
um to that requirement as well
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
so if you want to sell a dollar ticket
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
you have to have a 25
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
ticket or a 50 cent ticket available as
 
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:50.709 align:start position:0%
ticket or a 50 cent ticket available as
well

01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
for the uh offered to the public we
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
support that
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
as well we'd ask your support for this
 
01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr newman and for the
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative romney
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh mr newman um
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
bring us back in time the lucky seven
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
and especially for the new members
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh was something that that was the
 
01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.149 align:start position:0%
uh was something that that was the
machines

01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
were never voted in by the house uh or
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
and it was it the courts refresh my
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
memory was the courts that
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
said that that these machines were okay
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
and was it the courts that said that
 
01:11:32.159 --> 01:11:32.950 align:start position:0%
and was it the courts that said that
that

01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
a piece of paper needed to come out the
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
bottom of the machine even though no one
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
looks at it
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh it was not and actually
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative rami
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
um it was not the court it believe it
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
was legislation
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
passed i'm thinking 2010 or 11
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
um that authorized the commission
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
of course that was the old commission to
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh allow these machines provided that
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
they adopted rules and in that language
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
that statute required the paper ticket
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
to be dispensed
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
the court got involved because at the
 
01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.430 align:start position:0%
the court got involved because at the
time

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
the racing and charitable gaming
 
01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.630 align:start position:0%
the racing and charitable gaming
commission

01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
decided not to promulgate rules and
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
a manufacturer sued the commission
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
and the court said the statute clearly
 
01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.270 align:start position:0%
and the court said the statute clearly
mandated

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
that the commission had to promulgate
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
rules that was the court involvement
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
the supreme court upheld that superior
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
court ruling
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
and eventually the commission did
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe it was around 2014 or 15
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
that these electronic devices began to
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
be used in new hampshire along with the
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
handheld paper tickets and a follow-up
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up and the history is that they
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to simulate
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
what's the history of the paper why why
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
the paper coming out the bottom
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
was that to simulate the uh the hand
 
01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:03.990 align:start position:0%
was that to simulate the uh the hand
pull

01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
pull
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
tabs or something that people want
 
01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.189 align:start position:0%
tabs or something that people want
that's

01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's correct the idea was that the
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
electronic device would dispense
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
in addition to showing on the screen it
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
would dispense a paper ticket
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
that the customer the player would hold
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
that ticket in their hand the way they
 
01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:22.630 align:start position:0%
that ticket in their hand the way they
do

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know sitting at the bar at the
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
american legion or something
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
but what we've come to realize is that
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
that's simply not what happens
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
we literally throw away virtually
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
every one of those tickets in every
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
place that uses them at the end of the
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
night no customer
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
takes that ticket to the window no
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
customer looks at that ticket
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
it is a big pile of wasted paper uh
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day thank you all set
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
um yeah i can't help myself i
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
i need to ask this question um and it
 
01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:03.990 align:start position:0%
i need to ask this question um and it
follows

01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
follows
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
from representative abrami digging into
 
01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.590 align:start position:0%
from representative abrami digging into
the

01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
history of these provisions and uh
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
is the language that's repeated in this
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
bill it's not new language it has to be
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
in there because of the
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
change elsewhere but this is the
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
language that i want
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
to ask mr newman about the legislation
 
01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.350 align:start position:0%
to ask mr newman about the legislation
said

01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
it says and this is already in the
 
01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.270 align:start position:0%
it says and this is already in the
statute

01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
that any permitted lucky seven device
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
quote shall not be in the nature of a
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
slot machine
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
unquote it's my question to mr newman is
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what that means
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh yes i believe i can tell you what i
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
believe it means
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure i'm the definitive uh
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
you know resource
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
but my understanding of that is that it
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
cannot be
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
um slot machine in that it cannot
 
01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.669 align:start position:0%
um slot machine in that it cannot
operate

01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
operate
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh on a random number generator with
 
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.110 align:start position:0%
uh on a random number generator with
unlimited

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
unlimited
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
amount of prizes uh lucky seven
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
electronic lucky seven devices
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh as you know are uh limited to
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
the number of tickets available in each
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
deal in this case 3 500
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
if it went to 14 000 they'll be that
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
limitation so
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
under no circumstance could you ever win
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
more than 3 500
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
right now because and that would be if
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
you gave away all the money taken in
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
um whereas with a slot machine of course
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
you could win
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
an unlimited amount of money and the
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
other thing is the other significant
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
a slot machine and a lucky seven
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
dispensing device
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
is that a lucky seven dispensing device
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh dispenses a ticket in a predetermined
 
01:15:50.239 --> 01:15:51.110 align:start position:0%
uh dispenses a ticket in a predetermined
order

01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh just uh you know there's already i
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
mean ticket number 122
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be a five dollar winner it
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
makes no difference
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
you know nothing can change that um you
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
know a ticket number 187
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be a loser nothing can
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
change that it's a matter of who
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
happens to buy that ticket which of
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
course is incredible you know very much
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
different than the way a slot machine
 
01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.350 align:start position:0%
different than the way a slot machine
operates

01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
operates
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
i follow up thank you that's
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's helpful it's good to have that
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
background uh
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh put out into the hearing um
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question comes from your
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
pointing out that the tickets uh are in
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
a predetermined order in the uh
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
which means that you inevitably reach a
 
01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.550 align:start position:0%
which means that you inevitably reach a
point

01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
where the remaining tickets to be played
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
have no winners among them
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
so that people who are playing from that
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
point forward
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
although they don't know it have no have
 
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
zero chance of winning
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
um is that true and is there any way to
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh abort a game when when it's reached
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
that point
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
um i believe that is true representative
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
just as right now if you walk into a vfw
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
or a legion right there might be 70
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
tickets left in the box of tickets
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
to buy and there may be no winners left
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
in that box and nobody
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
the the customer you know wouldn't
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily know that
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
um and and i would go back to what uh mr
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
mcintyre said
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's one of the advantages of
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
increasing the deal size is that you
 
01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:39.830 align:start position:0%
increasing the deal size is that you
have

01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know more opportunities to have
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
winners in the deal now could there
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
still be a time when there are no
 
01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.870 align:start position:0%
still be a time when there are no
winners

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
winners
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
left to play with no one knowing that
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's true and i'm not sure there's a
 
01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.070 align:start position:0%
that's true and i'm not sure there's a
way

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
to to change that um given the nature of
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
the way lucky seven tickets are and that
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
they have a predetermined amount of
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
winners in the
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay we'll leave it at that unless um
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
director mcintyre wishes to
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
somebody that doesn't mean this in a
 
01:18:22.159 --> 01:18:22.630 align:start position:0%
somebody that doesn't mean this in a
deal

01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
deal
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
how many of these
 
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
well that depends on whether it's in the
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
paper games i'm going to give you an
 
01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.149 align:start position:0%
paper games i'm going to give you an
approximations

01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
approximations
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh my understanding is in
 
01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.550 align:start position:0%
representative uh my understanding is in
your

01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
paper ticket games the ones that a
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
bartender would sell you a ticket
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
um or that the volunteer would sell you
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
a ticket at the table
 
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
at a bingo game um those operate
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
on about a 75 payback
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
most of them they're not all but about
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
but most of them
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
so about 75 of the money goes back in
 
01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:04.950 align:start position:0%
so about 75 of the money goes back in
prizes

01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
prizes
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
in the electronic games it's about 90
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
of the money goes back in prizes
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't answer my question
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
what's the number of winners
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
in a group of 3500
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry i wouldn't be able to
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
know that um
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
it would really depend on the you know
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
each game is approved by the lottery
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
so the game has a mix of winners some 50
 
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
winners a dollar winners
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
um it's you know a 499 dollar winner
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh i know they try to make as many
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
winning potential winning tickets as
 
01:19:43.199 --> 01:19:43.990 align:start position:0%
winning potential winning tickets as
possible

01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
because that's how you keep people
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
continuing to play but i couldn't give
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
you an exact number
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
i mean certainly my sense would be it's
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
probably one in five tickets wins but
 
01:19:59.040 --> 01:19:59.430 align:start position:0%
probably one in five tickets wins but
val

01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
val
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
are you on still valerie do you know the
 
01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.590 align:start position:0%
are you on still valerie do you know the
answer

01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
as rick said there's no standard because
 
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
every game is going to be different but
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
charlie's right it's usually around one
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
in five
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman on i just have one
 
01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:24.709 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on i just have one
question

01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
for rick on can you tell us what grover
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
gaming is is this the place that
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
produces the machines or what
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
sure grover gaming is a manufacturer of
 
01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:38.790 align:start position:0%
sure grover gaming is a manufacturer of
electronic

01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
lucky seven dispensing devices
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
they produce the machines
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
we have one other person wants to
 
01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.149 align:start position:0%
we have one other person wants to
testify

01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
said none uh tyler clark
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
i believe you're you've been promoted
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%

01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman major and members
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%

in advance
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
i have to work from home because we had
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
a flood at our office so i'm looking at
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
my dog who's asleep right now
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
and he's a ticking time bomb in case
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
there is a gust of wind so if he starts
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
to bark
 
01:21:23.910 --> 01:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but i did send the committee
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
a list of links last night that
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
and most of them are videos but
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully they provide some clarity as
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
to the products that we're
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
discussing today uh there is a link to
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
what a machine in new hampshire looks
 
01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.070 align:start position:0%
what a machine in new hampshire looks
like

01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh in various links that show you the
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
type of paper tickets that are offered
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
at bingo events in fraternal halls
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
and he is being in opposition right i am
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct sir
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
and also at the bottom of that email is
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
a link to all of the approved
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
games from the lottery commission so you
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
can see to answer your question
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
chairman major the the amount of winners
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
in each game because it is a list of all
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
the games that have been approved and
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
their payouts and the amount of winners
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
and how the game is played is in that
 
01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.669 align:start position:0%
and how the game is played is in that
way

01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
so uh diamond distributors is located in
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
maltenburg new hampshire
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
and we're one of the leading
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
distributors of paper lucky 7 tickets in
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
these are the tickets sold in
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
conjunction with bingo games
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
diamond services over 80 granite state
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
charities with lucky seven tickets and
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
bingo supplies
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
we are on the front lines of new
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire's bingo industry in
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
an industry which has helped new
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire charities fundraise for
 
01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.550 align:start position:0%
hampshire charities fundraise for
decades

01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
decades
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i will say while fraternals also
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
offer these tickets
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
bingos can be run in two ways they can
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
be run by the charity
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
itself for example the plasto gun club
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
has a function room
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
on the second floor so that uh club
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
actually runs bingo on their own with
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
their members
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
but for charities that do not have the
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
benefit of having their own space
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
they rent out a space at a commercial
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
hall so diamond distributors oppose the
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
senate bill 22
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
and we respectfully request that this
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
bill is moved itl
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
in prior years we've heard testimony
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
saying that the requirement to dispense
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
a paper ticket from a lucky 7 dispenser
 
01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.669 align:start position:0%
a paper ticket from a lucky 7 dispenser
device

01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
device
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
is cumbersome but this ticket is what
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
differentiates these bright
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
flashy devices from an electronic gaming
 
01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.030 align:start position:0%

machine

01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
machine
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
currently there are lucky seven
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
dispensing devices in facilities that to
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
the untrained eyes
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
resemble slot machines these devices
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
offer bright screens
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%

and fractional payouts rsa287e21 states
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
as it was pointed out by representative
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
ames any permitted lucky seven device
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%

01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
machine
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
and to invoke the words of a former
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
colleague of mine who has since retired
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
and used to testify before this
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
committee if it walks like a duck
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
and quacks like a duck it's in the
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
nature of a duck
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
without the ticket being dispensed these
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
machines will further blur the line
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
between lucky 7 dispensing devices and
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
electronic gaming machines
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
there is also no guarantee this proposal
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
will provide cost savings or increased
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
revenues to charities
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
there is no language in senate bill 22
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
that states any savings from the removal
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
or option of the dispense tickets will
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
be passed down
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
from the manufacturers distributors and
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
bingo consultants
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
who sell operate and promote these
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
machines there's also concern with
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
increasing the maximum size of a deal
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
from 3 500 to 14 000 tickets
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
we sell our products to charities who
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
hold legitimate bingos
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
advertise these bingos and draw a crowd
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
at these events the most common paper
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
ticket deals sold
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
are around seventeen hundred and fifty
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
tickets thirty five hundred ticket deals
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
are less frequently purchased due to
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
their size
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
a thirty five hundred ticket deal is
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
even more difficult to sell during the
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
covet era where social distancing is
 
01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:47.750 align:start position:0%
covet era where social distancing is
required

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
and event occupancy is limited it is
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
highly unlikely a charity operating a
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
real bingo
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
would purchase paper deals larger than 3
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
500 tickets
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
the increased size of deals would solely

benefit those who promote lucky 7
machines

01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
and will potentially hurt charities who
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
run legitimate bingos
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
charities raise significantly more money
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
from paper deals than electronic deals
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
paper games have varying payouts but
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
they average a payout of 75 to 75
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
70 to 75 percent to the players and
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
leave the remaining 25 to 30 percent to
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
the charity
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
this is in comparison to the machines
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
which pay out roughly 90
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
to players and leaves 10 for charities
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
in fact charities that run bingo in
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
facilities that also offer these
 
01:25:29.679 --> 01:25:30.390 align:start position:0%
facilities that also offer these
machines

01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
feel it causes them to lose revenue it
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
should also be noted that facilities can
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
have both a games of chance license
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
plus a bingo and lucky 7 license having
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
the bingo license allows games of chance
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
facilities to operate lucky seven
 
01:25:43.199 --> 01:25:44.149 align:start position:0%
facilities to operate lucky seven
machines

01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
considering these machines are not
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
limited to being solely in the room
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
where bingo is conducted
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
this then gives these facilities a
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
product that creates a casino vibe
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
lucky seven machines can be found in
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
hallways in rooms throughout a facility
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
this has led to what is called ghost
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
bingo ghost bingo is where there is an
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
intent to hold a bingo game
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't come to fruition due to a
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
lack of players
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
the intent to hold the bingo game then
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
allows these machines to operate
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
from noon to 1am this past summer
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature raised the maximum price
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
of a lucky 7 ticket from 50 cents to a
 
01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:19.590 align:start position:0%
of a lucky 7 ticket from 50 cents to a
dollar

01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
through rulemaking lucky 7 dispensing
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
devices had their rate of play increased
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
from 5 seconds to every 3 seconds
 
01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:28.070 align:start position:0%
from 5 seconds to every 3 seconds
hypothetically

01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
hypothetically
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
a player can now insert 20 dollars into
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
a lucky 7 dispensing device
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
turn on the autoplay function and the
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
machine will play 20 times in one minute
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
diamond distributors respectfully
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
request the committee reject further
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
changes to lucky 7 dispensing devices
 
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
the changes proposed in this build
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
further blur the line between a
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
dispensing device
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
we're also very encouraged to see the
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously pass a bill to
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
study charitable gaming
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
since the proliferation of charitable
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
casinos we feel the bingo and lucky
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
seven industry is now often overlooked
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
and would welcome further study on
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
issues related to lucky seven
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
and bingo and i thank you for your
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
time this morning and the opportunity to
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
mr clark would you take questions yes i
 
01:27:33.679 --> 01:27:35.510 align:start position:0%
mr clark would you take questions yes i
would

01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh rep senator brown thank you mr chair
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr clark for your testimony
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
i i would imagine that there's one
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
provision in this bill that you would
 
01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:44.709 align:start position:0%
provision in this bill that you would
support

01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
that you didn't talk about and that
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
would be uh section three
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
the adding back of the 25 cent uh ticket
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know we as a business don't sell too
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
many 25 cent tickets
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
um but the way i do read this
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is that it's actually a
 
01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.310 align:start position:0%
legislation is that it's actually a
mandate

01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
for charities to buy these deals so if
 
01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
somebody offers a one dollar ticket at
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
their bingo or you know at their
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
fraternal then it's stating that the
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
charity shall also offer
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
25 and 50 cent tickets so
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
i read that as a mandate we're pretty
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
neutral on that aspect of the bill but i
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
would just point that out to the
 
01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:25.910 align:start position:0%
would just point that out to the
committee

01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
curious thank you any further questions
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
yeah um sorry
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't have my hand up but fortunately
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
i was unmuted
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
um at least for me uh my
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
question is really uh whether we'll have
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
the written statement or maybe it's been
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
sent to us
 
01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
last night that it was just delivered uh
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
in hand mr clark did you uh
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
send us last night what you read this
 
01:28:58.639 --> 01:29:00.390 align:start position:0%
send us last night what you read this
morning

01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
i did not send a copy last night i
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
figured i would save it i had a couple
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
edits to make this morning
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
i was taught when drafting something you
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
should always make a first draft and
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
sleep on it read it the next day but i'm
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
send it over after this hearing
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
i will then i don't have to worry about
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you this is not to on
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
mr clark but to on
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
charlie and so if it's not time for that
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
yet i'll wait
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
no that's fine go ahead
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
you you told us
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
on that these machines
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
are operating now the electronic to you
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
in your first uh comment to on
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg on that
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
that the existing electronic machines do
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
not dispense
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
the law is very clearly written at this
 
01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:21.030 align:start position:0%
the law is very clearly written at this
point

01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
that they must dispense and
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
that and it was written that way in
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
order to differentiate them
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
from slot machines make the play
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat slower
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
on and allow people
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
these these machines were were
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
allowed in the first place simply as
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
dispensing machines not as electronic
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
gaming machines
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
for the convenience of the various
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
fraternal halls
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
and it seems that they have already
 
01:31:02.639 --> 01:31:03.590 align:start position:0%
and it seems that they have already
become

01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
electronic gaming machines that um
 
01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.229 align:start position:0%
electronic gaming machines that um
[Music]

01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
may be as uh as or more
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
um on
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
like slot machines than the ones that
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
were just approved for historic
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
racing and that are going
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
into a lot of fraternal organizations
 
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.070 align:start position:0%
into a lot of fraternal organizations
that

01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
on you have a question this this is my
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
question is this true
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
no sorry but um representative melanie
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
if i misspoke i apologize no the
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
the machines that are in place all
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
dispense a paper ticket
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
they do but they also allow i guess we
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
didn't specify that they
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
they allow you to find out that you have
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
won or lost
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
just by having on a large bell ring
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you mr chair uh
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
this this question is for
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh charlie or valerie um
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
so the 3 500 ticket it doesn't exist
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
the 25 35 ended for the uh electronic
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
machines the 3 500 tickets
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
of what i heard i heard doesn't really
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
exist in statute
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
but uh but it is a common
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
number that that is used uh uh in a play
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
you would call it that but it was also
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
said that
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
some some establishments probably the
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
larger ones
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
four boxes of these 3 500 tickets and
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
combine them
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
and load them into the machine it sounds
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
like so that
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
the 1400 already exists can you give us
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
a sense of
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
first off can you explain that a little
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
bit more and
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
to does how many how many of the
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
locations actually
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
will group different you know four boxes
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
valid against that yeah so the
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
the 3500 is not set in statute but it is
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
set by rule
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
and the rules we limit it to 3 500 we
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
also allow
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
co-mingling which means you would take
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
four separate deals
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
put them in a bowl together mix them up
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
and sell them at once
 
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
rather than one deal then the next deal
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
then the next deal
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
they're all sort of blended together
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
and sold at one time that's what
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
co-mingling is and that can be
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
up to four deals which is 14 000 tickets
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
right but they're actually four separate
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
deals just mixed together
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up then follow-up the debt apply
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
because it sounded like you were just
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
talking about the single tickets not the
 
01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:57.189 align:start position:0%
talking about the single tickets not the
machine

01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
machine
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
tickets but that does that also apply to
 
01:34:00.239 --> 01:34:00.629 align:start position:0%
tickets but that does that also apply to
the

01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
electronic uh lucky seven machines
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
yes so so the same thing would apply in
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
a machine
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
they would just um instead of having
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
one deal sell out at a time it would
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
take one ticket from one deal another
 
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
ticket from the next deal another ticket
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
from the next deal
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
and and so they have four deals playing
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
at once and you're never
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
the players not sure which deal they're
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
gonna get the ticket from
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
that helps prevent people from jackpot
 
01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.270 align:start position:0%
that helps prevent people from jackpot
hunting

01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
hunting
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
where they'll stop playing a deal
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
because it's hit the jackpot this way by
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
mixing them
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
up it continues the play and the
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
interest in continuing to play
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up please one more
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up then we've got to move on
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know valerie so when when they load
 
01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:50.310 align:start position:0%
you know valerie so when when they load
the

01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
these device machines is it they don't
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
load pieces of paper in there right
 
01:34:58.830 --> 01:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
or why are they it's electronically
 
01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:02.629 align:start position:0%
or why are they it's electronically
loaded

01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
they could do it manually but the ones
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
that we currently have they've all
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
evolved and i believe all of them now
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
are electronically loaded
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
in from the cloud okay that's just
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
that's huge qualification in my mind i
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
just want to understand thank you
 
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative then we have one more
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
person that
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
showed up wants to testify i just wanted
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
to tell you that that
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
there's a fran wendell bowl that signed
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
up late and she's
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
ready in the attendees you're right i i
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
have an
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
email that was sent to me this morning
 
01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.109 align:start position:0%
email that was sent to me this morning
before

01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
8 o'clock so uh lettering
 
01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:44.790 align:start position:0%
8 o'clock so uh lettering
okay

01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh if you're on a phone it's star six to
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
one mute
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
she's on i don't know
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
okay took me a minute on a cell phone
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
how to figure out
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
are you testifying for or against
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
i'm testifying four okay thank you
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay uh for the record
 
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
fran wendell bow i represent powerhouse
 
01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.590 align:start position:0%
fran wendell bow i represent powerhouse
gaming

01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm actually in support of all of the
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming bills that are being
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
heard today 22
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
23 25 and 27 but i specifically want to
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 22. um
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
i think what we need to remember is that
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
the charitable gaming was terribly
 
01:36:51.119 --> 01:36:52.310 align:start position:0%
the charitable gaming was terribly
impacted

01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
by kovitz and were shut down and
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're really behind the ball so to
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
speak and they are fundraising
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
for the terrible works that they do
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
as you've already heard uh you have
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
various service organizations
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
like the vfw and the uh legion
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
and all the good work they do but you
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
also have um
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
sports teams and scholarship funds
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
and so all of those entities are hurting
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
and this legislation particularly where
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
it talks about
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
the option of not having a paper ticket
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
that directly is paid for by the
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
charities they pay for the purchase of
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
the ticket
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
and the tickets that the electronic
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
machine use
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
with having to be the double um
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know the double ticket is very
 
01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:46.870 align:start position:0%
you know the double ticket is very
expensive

01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
and if you go and you watch people
 
01:37:49.679 --> 01:37:50.470 align:start position:0%
and if you go and you watch people
playing

01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
playing
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
um electronic machines you'll see the
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
receipts coming out and just piling up
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
hardly anybody actually picks up the
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
ticket because they
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
already know if they want or lost from
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
looking on the screen
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
which is great because people like me
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
that have bad eyesight
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
or have arthritis in their hands you're
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
not dealing
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
with squinting at little writing so it's
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
great advantage
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
for people to use the electronic that
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
are handicapped
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
but anyway it would save the charities
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of money uh and add to their
 
01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:25.910 align:start position:0%
a lot of money uh and add to their
profitability

01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
profitability
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
having the cost of the paper
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
heavily discounted by
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
not many people printing them the other
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
the housekeeping measures of this just
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
cleaning up there's
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
nothing new happening the
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
co-mingling with the size of the deal
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
has been going on for quite
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
some time so there's really no impact
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
there but it certainly gives a lot more
 
01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.629 align:start position:0%
there but it certainly gives a lot more
flexibility

01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
and just bear in mind i don't
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
know how many facilities that you've
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
heard from
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
as we all know it's difficult to get
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
volunteers together for these things and
 
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
so sometimes it's difficult to motivate
 
01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:15.830 align:start position:0%
so sometimes it's difficult to motivate
them

01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
to um you know contact the committee
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
members and so on
 
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
so um i think that hits
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
the highlight of the advantages
 
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
of centerville 22. we're not expanding
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're not doing
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
anything that hasn't you know been
 
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
under existing law the bag and
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
um box issue
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
again is just catching up with
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
technology and the way these things are
 
01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.629 align:start position:0%
technology and the way these things are
printed

01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
printed
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
so um i do hope that the committee um
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
supports this i um thank you for
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
allowing me i i don't i don't know if
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
anybody heard but i had a 10 o'clock
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
emergency dental appointment
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
and when you walk into the dentist and
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
say make it fast
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
i was out of the chair in 15 minutes so
 
01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.189 align:start position:0%
i was out of the chair in 15 minutes so
um

01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
i do i hope to actively participate in
 
01:40:08.239 --> 01:40:08.629 align:start position:0%
i do i hope to actively participate in
the

01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
um subcommittee and i'm so glad that you
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
guys are hearing this so early
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
so that there is time to uh
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
iron out the little snags instead of
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
just saying oh let's throw it into
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh study because um these bills tend to
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
get thrown into study and
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
then they never get really taken up
 
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
again so i'm glad that you have the time
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
to accommodate
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
um giving it any
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
extra attention it needs to clarify
 
01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:40.149 align:start position:0%
extra attention it needs to clarify
things

01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
all right so um thank you for my
 
01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:46.790 align:start position:0%
all right so um thank you for my
testimony

01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
of being allowed and i look forward to
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
working with the committee
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh to get these bills passed thank you
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
did you take
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
questions i certainly will i'll rub some
 
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.070 align:start position:0%
questions i certainly will i'll rub some
names

01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
names
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
yeah good good morning and uh you're
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
sounding amazingly vigorous in spite of
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
your dental
 
01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:08.709 align:start position:0%
your dental
emergency

01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you you spoke about
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh the monetary difficulties
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
for the loss of
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming revenue um that you've
 
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:22.629 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming revenue um that you've
seen

01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if you could help me
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
understand that quantify it
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh this year versus previous
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
years what if
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
what's the trend that uh was was uh
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
if there was a trend before this
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh past year senator before before
 
01:41:43.679 --> 01:41:44.870 align:start position:0%
uh past year senator before before
kovith

01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
kovith
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
what's happened in this most recent year
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
where you've indicated there's been
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
been difficulties representative ames
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
i i will really need to defer to
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
valerie um because they were totally
 
01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:06.709 align:start position:0%
valerie um because they were totally
shut

01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
shut
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
most of the year obviously there's been
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
a big
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
decrease so those statistics are kept
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
by lottery and if it's not general
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
access they have to go
 
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
and create a report to give it to
 
01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:21.990 align:start position:0%
and create a report to give it to
individuals

01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
so perhaps valerie can give you an idea
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
of what
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
has happened this year versus
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
i have to admit i was distracted what
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
was the question
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
trying to get a handle on the uh
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
uncharitable gaming
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
revenues um the uh testimony
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh is that there's been a
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
significant loss uh during the covet
 
01:42:54.639 --> 01:42:55.350 align:start position:0%
significant loss uh during the covet
period

01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
and so i'm i'm asking
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
for two things actually what was
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
happening before covet hit
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
to charitable gaming revenues was there
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
a trend
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
up or down and then what has happened
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
since then so charitable gaming
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
there's three different types um games
 
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
of chance has been
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
pretty steadily upward bingo is not
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
um it's continuing to
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
languish i guess you'd say you know it's
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
not getting better but it's not
 
01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.790 align:start position:0%
not getting better but it's not
necessarily

01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
getting worse but covet did shut down
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of the bingo halls so there has
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
been left less revenue at the bingo
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
halls um lucky seven i'd have to look at
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
the numbers but i'm
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
my assumption is that lucky seven has
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
taken a slight dip as well because
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
there there are fewer game halls open
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay can you get numbers to us the best
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
numbers you have
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
both for that before period of time
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
and after broken out into those three
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
categories that you've just mentioned
 
01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:01.830 align:start position:0%
categories that you've just mentioned
bingo

01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
bingo
 
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
lucky seven and uh what else
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh maybe i don't know
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i can do that whatever works for
 
01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:13.030 align:start position:0%
yeah i can do that whatever works for
you

01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
best information available so that's
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman could we add to
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
that on
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
you you seem to be keeping records of
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
which halls were open
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
if you've got it how many games of
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
chance halls
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
closed for how much time how many bingo
 
01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:47.990 align:start position:0%
closed for how much time how many bingo
halls

01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
halls
 
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
and how many you said lucky seven halls
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
so you seem to be distinguishing
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
between the ones that are only machines
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
with no bingo
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily track that we do
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
keep you know when people have licenses
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
when the rooms have a license
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
and the games but we don't have that
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
readily available we have to
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
go through some of our data and compile
 
01:45:16.719 --> 01:45:19.030 align:start position:0%
go through some of our data and compile
it

01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay so this i can just take that as an
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
impression of that
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
that the lucky seven halls um
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
were less of them were open were
 
01:45:33.189 --> 01:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
all both the bingo and the lucky seven
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
halls were
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
closing a lot of the lucky seven
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
are fraternal halls and a lot of them
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:45.109 align:start position:0%
 
completely

01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to testify for or
 
01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
against bill 22
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
and i thought that was going to be an
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
all right since none i'm closing the
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%

let me just take a five-minute break
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
before we get to the next
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%

which is 11 towns on the seacoast
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
senate bill 23 the concept was brought
 
01:53:34.629 --> 01:53:34.639 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
by one of my constituents as you know we
 
01:53:37.599 --> 01:53:38.790 align:start position:0%
by one of my constituents as you know we
have

01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
two charitable or at least two
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operations in
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
my district um
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
whenever a charitable organization
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
is uh signed up for charitable gaming
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
if a group had a four day run
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
at the brook currently they would have
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
to sign an affidavit they'd have to show
 
01:54:06.719 --> 01:54:06.950 align:start position:0%
to sign an affidavit they'd have to show
up

01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
in person and sign an affidavit on
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
every day that the organization is
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh participating at the brook or
 
01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:16.870 align:start position:0%
uh participating at the brook or
whichever

01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
whichever
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
facility they are um
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
doing their their there is gaming going
 
01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:23.030 align:start position:0%
doing their their there is gaming going
on

01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
on their behalf um sb
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
23 was at the request of one of these
 
01:54:29.599 --> 01:54:30.310 align:start position:0%
23 was at the request of one of these
charitable

01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
organizations because they found that
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
they could
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
not fully participate in all the days
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
due to the logistics of trying to get
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
someone there
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
to actually sign the affidavit in doing
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
a little background on this i spoke to
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
the chair of the lottery commission
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the point was made that this was
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
actually a fairly
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
archaic and outdated
 
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
requirement that went back to the days
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
when charitable organizations organized
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
so that when the gaming is actually done
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
by another organization such as the
 
01:55:16.159 --> 01:55:17.830 align:start position:0%
by another organization such as the
brook

01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
brook
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
that this is just a perfunctory
 
01:55:26.070 --> 01:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
justification for continuing it my
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
just to hold on i guess a toehold of
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
this was to have
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
the charitable organization at least
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
show up
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
once during the four days uh it was
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out that while that's a huge
 
01:55:46.709 --> 01:55:46.719 align:start position:0%
improvement over the current situation
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
it still might mean they have to go
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
across state miss
 
01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
work in order to actually sign up
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
amended the bill to pull out any
 
01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
requirement of having to show up
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
allowing the charitable organization to
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
participate fully without
 
01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
having to be present during that period
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
of time
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
which i fully support um
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
so that's the bill that's what it does
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh and in um
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
and i hope you will uh support its
 
01:56:24.719 --> 01:56:25.669 align:start position:0%
and i hope you will uh support its
passage

01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
passage
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you would you take
 
01:56:28.639 --> 01:56:29.669 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you would you take
questions

01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:29.679 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you senator sherman i
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
understand what the need is for what
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
but there are on
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
four sections right immediately after
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
the one that you're repealing that say
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
that the charitable organization
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
is going to be on
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
figuring handling the money handling
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
who's there
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
all sorts of things like that and did
 
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
you look at those to try to
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
and how is that handled now because i do
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
that the charitable organizations um
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
finesse these things somehow sometimes
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
at this point on if
 
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
the question of how it's handled now
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
might be better answered by
 
01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
valerie thank you i
 
01:57:34.390 --> 01:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
i agree that valerie would probably be
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
better at answering that
 
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
what my understanding is that the only
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
purpose of this person
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
showing up once a day
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
is to sign an affidavit they're not
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
handling any money they're not handling
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
anything in fact there is a prohibition
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
against them
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
even participating in the gaming so
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
they may cross the state to
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
sign in they'd have to do it every day
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
so this one component of that
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
chapter is the one that they are finding
 
01:58:08.159 --> 01:58:08.550 align:start position:0%
chapter is the one that they are finding
so

01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you bring it out on section
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
roman 12 says the charitable
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
organization shall deposit
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
cash and proceeds from the game of
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
chance into the account required under
 
01:58:28.629 --> 01:58:28.639 align:start position:0%
this chapter
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
and on someone is going to be paying all
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
expenses by check it's inferred that
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's a charitable organization
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
and on on
 
01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
known 13 isn't applying
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
but on 15 says that the
 
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
on games of chance for our chips have no
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
monetary face value the chatter
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
organization may offer any number of
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
games per licensed event
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
on and 16
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
says the charitable organization may
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
offer one game per licensed event in
 
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
which each
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
player may spend up to 250 there are a
 
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
number of places throughout this
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
section of the statute that on 19
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
also on that
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
and 20 that talk about the charitable
 
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
organization's responsibilities
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how this fits together
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
with them not showing up at all
 
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
and hope that we can figure that out
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you was that a question or
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i i it my understanding in speaking
 
01:59:48.950 --> 01:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
with the chairman of the commission that
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
this would not impact those because
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
these the role of this person showing up
 
01:59:54.159 --> 01:59:55.510 align:start position:0%
these the role of this person showing up
is

01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
simply to sign the affidavit they don't
 
01:59:58.480 --> 01:59:58.790 align:start position:0%
simply to sign the affidavit they don't
have

01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
so the rest of it it might be a good
 
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
topic for the commission
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
that was discussed with the last two
 
02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:10.390 align:start position:0%
that was discussed with the last two
bills

02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
looking at charitable gaming whether
 
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
these are still pertinent
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
but the role of the person showing up to
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
sign the affidavit is
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
solely to sign the affidavit in my
 
02:00:21.599 --> 02:00:23.189 align:start position:0%
solely to sign the affidavit in my
understanding

02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
and that is what is onerous
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
for the organizations many of whom
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
have no permanent staff
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
have no officers to go over except
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
people who are also working so they have
 
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
to take time off from work they have to
 
02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:41.030 align:start position:0%
to take time off from work they have to
travel

02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
travel
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
none of which is reimbursed so
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
that was the goal um but i agree with
 
02:00:48.159 --> 02:00:48.950 align:start position:0%
that was the goal um but i agree with
you

02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
that you know there are some concerns
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
potentially later on in the statute but
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
valerie do you have anything to add to
 
02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:03.750 align:start position:0%
valerie do you have anything to add to
that

02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
um yes so i just wanted to clarify that
 
02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
he is correct the affidavit is is
 
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
from years ago when the charities did
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
run their own
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
games and this was sort of a as they
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
started to switch to game operator
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
employers who are much
 
02:01:24.149 --> 02:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
more savvy at how to run games properly
 
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
they continued the charity's
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
participation through the affidavit but
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't provide
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
any um assurances about um
 
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with the gaming
 
02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:37.270 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with the gaming
integrity

02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's really just they go in they sign a
 
02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
piece of paper
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
they don't accept any money they aren't
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
doing anything other than saying
 
02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
yep we're here and yes this game
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
night is our night um so we have no
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
objections to having that removed and
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
it because it really doesn't serve any
 
02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
purpose as far as
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
our needs to ensure the integrity of the
 
02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:01.510 align:start position:0%
our needs to ensure the integrity of the
games

02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
games
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
as far as paying checks and depositing
 
02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:04.790 align:start position:0%
as far as paying checks and depositing
money

02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
we do require um because the statute
 
02:02:07.679 --> 02:02:08.229 align:start position:0%
we do require um because the statute
does

02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
say that all licensees have to have a
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
criminal background check
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
so we do require whoever is accepting
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
that money on behalf of the charity it's
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
usually the chairman
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
or the treasurer does have to have a
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
criminal background check they would
 
02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
pick up the money
 
02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
and deposit it into the charities bank
 
02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:30.790 align:start position:0%
and deposit it into the charities bank
account

02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
i don't see any further questions there
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
is a handful
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
whoops a representative
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you this is a follow-up to valerie
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
when it
 
02:02:50.070 --> 02:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
so the member f
 
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
the treasurer of the association of the
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
organization has to
 
02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
travel to this place to pick up
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
the money and count it and take it to
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
their bank account not necessarily
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
um it's typically i'm not there's no
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
requirement that they physically go to
 
02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
the location but they're the ones who
 
02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:12.390 align:start position:0%
the location but they're the ones who
are

02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
accepting and depositing the money it
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
has to be the chairman or the
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
or the treasurer or designee but they
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
they may do it other ways we don't
 
02:03:24.070 --> 02:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
require that they go in person to pick
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
up the check
 
02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%

02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
essentially a question to
 
02:04:13.589 --> 02:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
senator sherman if he would mind if we
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
try to clean up this language
 
02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
because on you may call it archaic but
 
02:04:22.069 --> 02:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
it was put in by representative wyler
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
when he got
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming established about a
 
02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
decade ago
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
on and um on a lot of it does put
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities on the charitable
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
organization which the charitable
 
02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:35.669 align:start position:0%
organization which the charitable
organization

02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think should be be responsible
 
02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:39.510 align:start position:0%
i don't think should be be responsible
for

02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
because they are not involved in
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
this operation except to receive money
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
if i can answer that i i would be more
 
02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:50.149 align:start position:0%
if i can answer that i i would be more
than

02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
happy to have the bill as is
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
as often how happens when our bills come
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
to the house
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
have it improved and uh the only
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
thing i would ask is that uh and i
 
02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
didn't mean any offense
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
by calling it archaic maybe vestigial is
 
02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:07.669 align:start position:0%
by calling it archaic maybe vestigial is
better

02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
um but the uh the only thing i would ask
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
we keep intact the original intent which
 
02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:16.470 align:start position:0%
we keep intact the original intent which
is

02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
this this uh this bill has been
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
enjoys the support of both the
 
02:05:23.589 --> 02:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations as well as the
 
02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators
 
02:05:28.629 --> 02:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
because it removes something that as
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
valerie said
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
really serves no purpose and um
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
but any other uh changes that you want
 
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
to make that would be supported by the
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
commission and the committee are are
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
i'm i would more than welcome them
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
valerie you have your hands up
 
02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to give some
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
assurances to representative almi
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
regarding some of the other requirements
 
02:05:56.069 --> 02:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
in the statute that are on the
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
charitable organization
 
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
um charitable organizations technically
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
can run their own
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
games of chance events most of them
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't because it's very complicated and
 
02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:07.350 align:start position:0%
don't because it's very complicated and
onerous

02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
onerous
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
when they hire a game operator employer
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
to run those games on their behalf
 
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
those requirements shift to the game
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
operator employer who is
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
doing the operation on behalf of the
 
02:06:18.079 --> 02:06:21.430 align:start position:0%
doing the operation on behalf of the
charity

02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
all right all right uh
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
would you let me see
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i will uh
 
02:06:42.550 --> 02:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
briefly try to sign up for this and i
 
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
apologize i guess i
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
i didn't do it correctly but i briefly
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
voted against the bills uh speaking in
 
02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new hampshire charitable
 
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
gaming operators association
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and just uh two quick points i want
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
to make
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
many of our rooms have run into the
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
a charity you know wanted to participate
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
in charitable gaming but because they
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
were located
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
or their members were located so far
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
from the room
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
it became impossible to let them
 
02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh operate because you you couldn't get
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
somebody who could drive
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
in some cases 30 40 miles you know every
 
02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
single day round trip
 
02:07:31.030 --> 02:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
to come in and i do want to reiterate
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
what valerie said
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is a
 
02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:36.790 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is a
person

02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know appears at the front desk is
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
handed a piece of paper
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
signs it it says i'm here and then
 
02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
literally walks out the door
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
they don't have any further involvement
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
the statute doesn't require
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
any further involvement and so it really
 
02:07:57.990 --> 02:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
has it really is a requirement that's
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
run its course
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
and does impede certain charities from
 
02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
being able to participate
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
um on the issue that uh a good point
 
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
that representative almi raised about
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
referring to the responsibilities of the
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
charity again i just would reiterate
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
the statute does say that when a charity
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
hires a game operator employer
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
those responsibilities now become the
 
02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:23.830 align:start position:0%
those responsibilities now become the
responsibility

02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
of the game operator employer so the
 
02:08:28.069 --> 02:08:28.079 align:start position:0%
game operator employer
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
does all of those things on behalf of
 
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
the charity
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
and deposits the money in a separate
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
account each day etc um
 
02:08:39.750 --> 02:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
and but one
 
02:08:41.669 --> 02:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
one final thing i will tell you that
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
when the bill was of this law was
 
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
originally passed
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
the requirement was a charity had to be
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
present all day long
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
and that was changed to the just show up
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
and sign a paper
 
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
and uh frankly i think you know even
 
02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's run its course so
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
we would support this change and ask you
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
any questions of rick newman
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
i see no hands up is there anybody else
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
in the attendees
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
janine anybody else want to ask
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
no questions then i'm going to close the
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:09:34.550 --> 02:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
now we're gonna make a little change to
 
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%

02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%

only sponsor on this
 
02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
senate bill 25 and he asked if i would
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
introduce it since he's
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%

bill
 
02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
requested by a constituent of his to
 
02:10:43.199 --> 02:10:44.149 align:start position:0%
requested by a constituent of his to

the administration of terrible naming
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
under current law charities may operate
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
games of chance
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
10 times per year senate bill
 
02:10:58.069 --> 02:10:58.079 align:start position:0%

02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
currently these 10 days are reset on the
 
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
anniversary when the license was
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
issued this date is different for every
 
02:11:07.119 --> 02:11:08.470 align:start position:0%
issued this date is different for every
charity

02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
charity
 
02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
so the groups running the games on their
 
02:11:12.870 --> 02:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
behalf must track the anniversary dates
 
02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
for every single
 
02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
charity which is very
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
administrative nightmare senate bill 25
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
resets the clock on december 31st for
 
02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:26.950 align:start position:0%
resets the clock on december 31st for
everyone

02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
each licensed charity gets 10 days
 
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
during the calendar year
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
the same as before this is a simple
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
change that will make it easier to
 
02:11:36.239 --> 02:11:37.109 align:start position:0%
change that will make it easier to
administer

02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
administer
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming in new hampshire then
 
02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
the senator asked
 
02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
for your support thank you
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
any uh any questions for representative
 
02:11:47.599 --> 02:11:50.950 align:start position:0%
any uh any questions for representative
major

02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
well okay i see none oh yes a
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
simply on this bill is in is within
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 27 senator guida's bill
 
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
well if senator guida's bill
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
gets tied up in a
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
in work sessions and is retained
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
and this goes forward
 
02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
this is simple this doesn't have the
 
02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:31.270 align:start position:0%
this is simple this doesn't have the
baggage

02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
baggage
 
02:12:34.870 --> 02:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
as the other bill does
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
follow up did i have a follow-up then
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
on it do you have an explanation from
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
him as to why they picked one
 
02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
two years oh no this
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
one doesn't affect the one year versus
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
this is a simple bill it doesn't change
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
the number of games
 
02:13:02.229 --> 02:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the licensing but
 
02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
it says the licensing terminates the
 
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
31st of december
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
and you have to renew it every year and
 
02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
when you do you're going to get your 10
 
02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:14.629 align:start position:0%
when you do you're going to get your 10
days

02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
where it is now the 10 days that's
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
the date that you get your license and
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
when you keep have to keep track of
 
02:13:28.470 --> 02:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
much more difficult than it is if
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
everybody has to start
 
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
okay any other any other questions for
 
02:13:41.589 --> 02:13:41.599 align:start position:0%
representative major
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything is here so they may
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to ask valerie in a second
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
i just want to um
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
mr uh uh representative major so
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
jenny uh as of eight o'clock this
 
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
morning that there was no one
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
else on the list to speak do you see any
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
anybody out there that wants to speak
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
okay let me ask uh uh can we can we let
 
02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
him in
 
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i want to ask uh valerie king a
 
02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:10.870 align:start position:0%
and i want to ask uh valerie king a
question

02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
can valerie can you just uh embellish
 
02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
why uh having all these different dates
 
02:14:18.159 --> 02:14:19.350 align:start position:0%
why uh having all these different dates
currently

02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
is a problem and why going to the one
 
02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
um prior to a few years ago it was the
 
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
single date
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
it was the the licenses are good for a
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
it that got changed a few years ago
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
because of
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
one constituent but it really wreaked
 
02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
havoc with the rest
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
of us um so having it converted back to
 
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
the old way does make it a lot easier
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
for the rooms to
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
um follow their their charities license
 
02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:50.149 align:start position:0%
um follow their their charities license
dates

02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
dates
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
and it it equally makes our lives a
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
little easier here in
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
the lottery okay thank you
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
any anybody have any questions for uh
 
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
for valerie
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:08.069 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
is this is indirectly related but uh
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the number of days
 
02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:15.270 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the number of days
here

02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
um we're actually just changing the time
 
02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
of the license but the license is
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
um allows the charity to operate
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
um games of chance for 10 days
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
which 10 days need not be consecutive
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
the question arises because we've got
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
another bill that we've
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
sent to the floor involving historic
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
horse racing
 
02:15:47.189 --> 02:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh gaming and uh
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
specifying that for every day
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
of operation of those games
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
there must be two charitable gaming
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations uh
 
02:16:01.599 --> 02:16:04.229 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations uh
participating

02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
participating
 
02:16:04.239 --> 02:16:07.589 align:start position:0%
participating
and

02:16:07.589 --> 02:16:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
does does is is there any potential for
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
confusion between those
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
two different rules that may apply to
 
02:16:17.589 --> 02:16:17.599 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
um no there won't be any issues with
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
regard to having two charities play at
 
02:16:25.119 --> 02:16:25.589 align:start position:0%
regard to having two charities play at
once

02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
once
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
this actually makes it a little easier
 
02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
because you can keep the same two
 
02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
charities at the same time they'll all
 
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
be licensed the same
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
time period they can coordinate it a
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
little easier i think
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
um the historic horse racing requirement
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
won't have any impact
 
02:16:47.349 --> 02:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
question uh any other questions of uh
 
02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
valor king
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none uh uh rick newman
 
02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
uh you'd like to testify go ahead thank
 
02:16:58.469 --> 02:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
rick newman speaking in favor of the
 
02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:01.830 align:start position:0%
rick newman speaking in favor of the
bill

02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators association
 
02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
um just very briefly i will tell you
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
that when the change took place
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
um all of our rooms saw a lot of
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
logistical problems it just is a
 
02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:18.070 align:start position:0%
logistical problems it just is a
difficult

02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
thing to keep track of whose license
 
02:17:20.479 --> 02:17:21.750 align:start position:0%
thing to keep track of whose license
expires

02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
expires
 
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
when um and as
 
02:17:29.349 --> 02:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
ms king said it it was a change that was
 
02:17:32.070 --> 02:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
asked for by one organization because
 
02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:32.950 align:start position:0%
asked for by one organization because
they

02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
had misunderstood when their license
 
02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:37.030 align:start position:0%
had misunderstood when their license
expired

02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
expired
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
um it was done as an amendment to a
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
a few years ago nobody saw it and
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
when we realized what happened we
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
realized then it was
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
going to be a problem and it has turned

sponsor senate bill 48
 
02:19:39.030 --> 02:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh this bill uh was
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
the topic of this bill was pointed out
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
to me by a person who is very active in
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
issues of property taxation and so forth
 
02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:46.230 align:start position:0%
issues of property taxation and so forth
uh

02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
it is it is a a part of our legislation
 
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
that is i find repugnant
 
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
as you know on ways and means every
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
formula for every tax
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
that is levied on our citizens and
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
businesses is a matter of public record
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
with one exception and that is the
 
02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
formula that's utilized to determine
 
02:20:06.250 --> 02:20:06.260 align:start position:0%
uh the um
 
02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:07.910 align:start position:0%
uh the um
[Music]

02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
current use property taxation uh this
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
was the result inadvertently of the
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
the blanket confidentiality that is
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
issued to anything that has to do with
 
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue administration
 
02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
under which the
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
current use board resides
 
02:20:28.469 --> 02:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
and so having spoken with
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
the commission of revenue and she and
 
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
the department are totally with this
 
02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:33.190 align:start position:0%
the department are totally with this
bill

02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh and in the interest of maintaining
 
02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
fuel transparency in government one of
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
the things that we all find very very
 
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
um compelling this bill is brought in
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
just to remove the components of the
 
02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
formula and the formula
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
itself from the confidentiality blanket
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's issued to
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
regulations and so all it does is it
 
02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:57.670 align:start position:0%
regulations and so all it does is it
adds

02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
adds
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
under d under rsa21j colon 14 roman 4
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
it inserts one additional thing that is
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
exempted from the confidentiality that's
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
the formula used by the department
 
02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
to assist the current youth board in a
 
02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
determination of current use tax rates
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
and all variables within that formula
 
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
including definition of those variables
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
if any
 
02:21:20.469 --> 02:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
there are private properties that are
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
utilized in determination
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the level of taxation that
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
information will remain totally
 
02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:28.070 align:start position:0%
information will remain totally
confidential

02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
but the formula itself uh cries out to
 
02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:31.190 align:start position:0%
but the formula itself uh cries out to
be

02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
as all other taxation formulas are
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
available to the public without any uh
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you senator any questions for the
 
02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:43.830 align:start position:0%
thank you senator any questions for the
senator

02:21:43.830 --> 02:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
senator
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative romney thank you
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
senator goddard
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
this is funny when i first read this
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
bill yesterday
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
my reaction was where's the formula
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
and i kept on searching for the formula
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
and i couldn't and the bill is
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
to do what you just said so i i think i
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
think this is a good idea
 
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh to uh let everybody be able to see
 
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
the formula more of a comment than
 
02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
anything else thank you
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman senator
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
on i believe
 
02:22:24.309 --> 02:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
that this formula is also invisible
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
to those of us who have land which is
 
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
not in current use but which is under
 
02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
deed restriction
 
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
by the planning boards um and
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
on from developments
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
that were create sub uh created
 
02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:40.550 align:start position:0%
that were create sub uh created
subdivisions

02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
and um i wonder would this also
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
it would i believe apply to them as far
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
as i know this concerns entirely
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
timberland which is in current use
 
02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
and on every now and then is
 
02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
harvested and in my case
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
we harvested my associations timberland
 
02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
on over a decade two decades ago now
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
and had to pay the timber tax but had no
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
idea how much
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
we were going to have to pay when we
 
02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:14.950 align:start position:0%
we were going to have to pay when we
started

02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
started
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
and when we hired somebody to do it so
 
02:23:18.150 --> 02:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
that you can't
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
tell whether you're going to make a
 
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
profit or a loss we were quite surprised
 
02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
to discover we were making a profit
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
30 of which went to the town so is that
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
what this is about
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh and would it also would
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
opening up this formula for
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
current use also apply to the formula it
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
would be the same formula wouldn't it
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
for subdivisions that had d restrictions
 
02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the current the intent of
 
02:23:48.389 --> 02:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
is to make the formula transparent to to
 
02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
any who would use it or or
 
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
just be interested in looking at it uh
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
again it's repugnant i think to our
 
02:23:56.399 --> 02:23:57.349 align:start position:0%
again it's repugnant i think to our
ethics

02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh that a taxation formula is hidden
 
02:24:02.550 --> 02:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
and it's the only one of its kind in the
 
02:24:04.230 --> 02:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
state everything else we can go to dra's
 
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
website and find out formulas and so on
 
02:24:08.230 --> 02:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
and so forth parameters metrics
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
but here we have taxation without if you
 
02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:11.510 align:start position:0%
but here we have taxation without if you
will

02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
i guess yes in a short way yes
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
any further questions for senator geider
 
02:24:28.230 --> 02:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
saying none we have
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%

02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
and much of that is enrolled in current

02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
we're very active in the current use
 
02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
rate setting process and we're act
 
02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:16.630 align:start position:0%
rate setting process and we're act
actually

02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
active when the formula that is used to
 
02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:20.870 align:start position:0%
active when the formula that is used to
determine

02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
determine
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
or calculate the assessment rate
 
02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
when that was re when that was developed
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago and
 
02:25:31.270 --> 02:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
when senator gaida brought this bill
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
forward i was
 
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
frankly i was surprised that that that
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
formula was not
 
02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
public knowledge and we feel it should
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
be um
 
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to hide there it is a it
 
02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
is a pretty straightforward
 
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
cash flow net present value cash flow
 
02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:48.630 align:start position:0%
cash flow net present value cash flow
analysis

02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
done looking at timberland and looking
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
at timberland
 
02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
from as if it were an investment
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
looking at it to determine all right
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
what are the costs
 
02:26:02.950 --> 02:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
what are the and what are the revenues
 
02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
that can be expected from that
 
02:26:04.479 --> 02:26:05.670 align:start position:0%
that can be expected from that
timberland

02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
timberland
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
and it calculates and includes things
 
02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
such as growth
 
02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
timber growth rates looks at different
 
02:26:12.309 --> 02:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
tree species
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
so it is a it is a a pretty
 
02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
standard model and we feel it should be
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
it should be publicly available for
 
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
folks to look at
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
i also want to stress a point that
 
02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
senator gaida had mentioned is
 
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
when the model was being developed there
 
02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:31.590 align:start position:0%
when the model was being developed there
were

02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
there was a question about what are
 
02:26:35.429 --> 02:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
management costs what management cost
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
should be included in the model
 
02:26:42.309 --> 02:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
for instance maintaining boundary lines
 
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
doing timber inventories things of that
 
02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:45.590 align:start position:0%
doing timber inventories things of that
nature

02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
nature
 
02:26:48.309 --> 02:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
and so the department of revenue reached
 
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
out to us
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
and other timberland owners across the
 
02:26:52.469 --> 02:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
state and said
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
can you provide us some examples of what
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
your cost
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
on a per acre basis would be
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
for those types of activities and so
 
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
they get they did a sampling of
 
02:27:06.389 --> 02:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
timberland owners across the state
 
02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
gathered that information on an
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
anonymous basis
 
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
and then were able to use that to calcu
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
to plug into this vap into this model to
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
calculate those carrying
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
carrying costs on this land and
 
02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know that was done with an
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
expectation of confidentiality
 
02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
and again this we believe this bill does
 
02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:31.590 align:start position:0%
and again this we believe this bill does
not

02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
does not um go against that
 
02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
that promise and we are supporting it
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
um again i wanted to speak to
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative almi's questions
 
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
timber tax is is separate
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
it is part it is included in the model
 
02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
but timber tax is looked and based
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
on the value of that stumpage in other
 
02:27:58.800 --> 02:27:59.270 align:start position:0%
on the value of that stumpage in other
words

02:27:59.270 --> 02:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
words
 
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
that tree that's growing on in the
 
02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:02.630 align:start position:0%
that tree that's growing on in the
ground

02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
ground
 
02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
on your property your timber tax is
 
02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:06.230 align:start position:0%
on your property your timber tax is
assessed

02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
assessed
 
02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
on that value whereas current
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
so current use assesses the land
 
02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
beneath that tree so current use
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
determines what is the productive
 
02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:19.510 align:start position:0%
determines what is the productive
capability

02:28:19.510 --> 02:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
capability
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
of this acre of land you know how much
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
timber can that acre of land grow what
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
is the cost to maintain that acre of
 
02:28:28.319 --> 02:28:29.750 align:start position:0%
is the cost to maintain that acre of
land

02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
land
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
when you and then that's how it's
 
02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
assessed annually as a
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
a property tax when you cut that temp
 
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
when that timber is on your property
 
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
growing as stumpage
 
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
it is considered real property at the
 
02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
time of severance
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
it used to be called the severance tax
 
02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
at the time of severance
 
02:28:51.270 --> 02:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
that real property then becomes personal
 
02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:52.070 align:start position:0%
that real property then becomes personal
property

02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
and it's at that point that the timber
 
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
tax is assessed
 
02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
and it's assessed based on the stumpage
 
02:28:58.560 --> 02:28:59.110 align:start position:0%
and it's assessed based on the stumpage
value

02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
value
 
02:29:02.710 --> 02:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
this value of that tree standing and so
 
02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
the model does take that into
 
02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:05.830 align:start position:0%
the model does take that into
consideration

02:29:05.830 --> 02:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
taxes paid when they calculate what are
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
your carrying costs
 
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
etc as for lands with conservation
 
02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:15.510 align:start position:0%
etc as for lands with conservation
easements

02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
easements
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
um many cut there is a a provision
 
02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
in in state law another i think it's rsa
 
02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
79b that allows conservation easement
 
02:29:26.479 --> 02:29:27.670 align:start position:0%
79b that allows conservation easement
land

02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
land
 
02:29:31.349 --> 02:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
um to be assessed based again on
 
02:29:34.469 --> 02:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
current use rates it essentially defers
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
to rsa 798
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
which is your current use rate but
 
02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
in almost all instances conservation
 
02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
easement land
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
is assessed using the current use
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
model rsa which is rsa 79a
 
02:29:54.790 --> 02:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
and so uh just to affirm
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
that yes senator guy is correct by
 
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
making this model for current use
 
02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:01.510 align:start position:0%
making this model for current use
assessment

02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
publicly available by de facto
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's also publicly available for those
 
02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
lands under conservation easements that
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
are assessed
 
02:30:14.070 --> 02:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
under this mechanism so i hope i
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
answered those questions and
 
02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to field any other
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
questions and we
 
02:30:21.990 --> 02:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
hope you support senate bill 48
 
02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you well thank you for your
 
02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:25.429 align:start position:0%
thank you well thank you for your
testimony

02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
testimony

employees go to those states to help
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
them recover
 
02:38:25.349 --> 02:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
from an emergency this would provide
 
02:38:26.550 --> 02:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
that kind of benefit
 
02:38:28.710 --> 02:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're able to get
 
02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:30.469 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're able to get
people

02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:38:32.870 --> 02:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
and equipment into our state during
 
02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:33.990 align:start position:0%
and equipment into our state during
emergencies

02:38:33.990 --> 02:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
i would just add finally mr chairman
 
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
that any out of state folks that come in
 
02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:41.429 align:start position:0%
that any out of state folks that come in
here

02:38:41.429 --> 02:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
would fully pay any gasoline taxes or
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
the rooms and meals tax
 
02:38:52.950 --> 02:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
or any specific transactions so
 
02:38:55.830 --> 02:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
the senate passed this bill i believe it
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
was on the consent calendar and we
 
02:38:59.349 --> 02:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
commend it to you
 
02:39:02.309 --> 02:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
 
02:39:02.319 --> 02:39:03.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
testimony

02:39:03.270 --> 02:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:39:07.030 --> 02:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
senator would you take questions uh sure
 
02:39:09.349 --> 02:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
although i think there probably will be
 
02:39:09.359 --> 02:39:10.389 align:start position:0%
although i think there probably will be
other

02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
um people more knowledgeable than i but
 
02:39:15.270 --> 02:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'll do my best to answer questions
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh rep representative i actually
 
02:39:22.230 --> 02:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you um
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
and this may be a question for for those
 
02:39:30.630 --> 02:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
others that you just referred to
 
02:39:33.590 --> 02:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
but um my sense looking at it looks like
 
02:39:34.389 --> 02:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
a very good deal
 
02:39:38.309 --> 02:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
let me start there and um bills again
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
um but my question to you is whether
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh this is true it also looks like a
 
02:39:45.429 --> 02:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
bill that uh
 
02:39:47.830 --> 02:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
may uh be a template for bills that are
 
02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
being offered
 
02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
around the country and um
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
my question to you is that the case and
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
do you know whether
 
02:39:58.070 --> 02:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
other states are also enacting bills
 
02:39:59.110 --> 02:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
like this
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much uh
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative my understanding is that
 
02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
it is based off of you know some of the
 
02:40:10.230 --> 02:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
agreements that i cited um with in
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
connecticut maine of vermont
 
02:40:15.510 --> 02:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
but again some of the utility
 
02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
representatives and let's remember that
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
they have
 
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
businesses in or the
 
02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
the utilities that serve new hampshire
 
02:40:26.230 --> 02:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
also serve other states
 
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
so um there would be some
 
02:40:31.750 --> 02:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
um continuity if you will and
 
02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:32.870 align:start position:0%
um continuity if you will and
reciprocities

02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
reciprocities
 
02:40:35.269 --> 02:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
but ask i think it'd be best to ask them
 
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
that specific question
 
02:40:41.269 --> 02:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you any question questions for
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
senator bradford sen none
 
02:40:47.590 --> 02:40:47.600 align:start position:0%

committee for
 
02:41:16.469 --> 02:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
this opportunity um uh att
 
02:41:19.510 --> 02:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
appreciates uh the opportunity to
 
02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
express support for this
 
02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh mike owen smith i'm the state
 
02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:25.590 align:start position:0%
uh mike owen smith i'm the state
president

02:41:25.590 --> 02:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
president
 
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
for atp here in new hampshire
 
02:41:30.630 --> 02:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to thank senator bradley
 
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
for sponsoring this bill and
 
02:41:34.150 --> 02:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
understanding the role that private
 
02:41:35.830 --> 02:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
organizations like atp
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
play in disaster response
 
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
att provides communication services
 
02:41:43.990 --> 02:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
across the country we have
 
02:41:46.309 --> 02:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
for 140 years we have a little bit of
 
02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
history of responding to
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
emergency situations and
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that so much critical
 
02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:54.870 align:start position:0%
the fact that so much critical
infrastructure

02:41:54.870 --> 02:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:41:57.269 --> 02:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
is owned by private companies it's
 
02:41:58.950 --> 02:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
important to have an effective
 
02:42:01.990 --> 02:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
emergency planning and response um and
 
02:42:02.710 --> 02:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
it should
 
02:42:06.150 --> 02:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
really promote a partnership between
 
02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
the private sector and the government
 
02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's certainly what
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is all about
 
02:42:14.950 --> 02:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
um after events on 9 11
 
02:42:17.429 --> 02:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
the 911 commission created the first net
 
02:42:17.439 --> 02:42:18.550 align:start position:0%
the 911 commission created the first net
authority

02:42:18.550 --> 02:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
authority
 
02:42:23.269 --> 02:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
and in 2017 at t was awarded the
 
02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
first net contract by the federal
 
02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
government for
 
02:42:29.510 --> 02:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
the next 25 years of which we're three
 
02:42:31.269 --> 02:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
years into what i believe
 
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
first is a public safety nationwide
 
02:42:37.030 --> 02:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
communications platform
 
02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
we've been very busy here in new
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire and elsewhere across the
 
02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
country over the last three years
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
building the first net network along
 
02:42:47.990 --> 02:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
with att's commercial network
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent it's it's one in the
 
02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
same but
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
first responders here in new hampshire
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh rely on firstnet
 
02:42:59.349 --> 02:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
again which is built and maintained by
 
02:42:59.359 --> 02:42:59.750 align:start position:0%
again which is built and maintained by
uh

02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:43:02.950 --> 02:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
atnt so um
 
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
last year's hurricane season is a great
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
example of why we need something like
 
02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:07.990 align:start position:0%
example of why we need something like
this

02:43:07.990 --> 02:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
and why we're asking for it with other
 
02:43:12.790 --> 02:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
members of the industry it was
 
02:43:15.429 --> 02:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
the most active and fifth costliest
 
02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
hurricane season on record
 
02:43:20.309 --> 02:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh 12 hurricanes made landfall onto the
 
02:43:20.319 --> 02:43:21.750 align:start position:0%
uh 12 hurricanes made landfall onto the
u.s

02:43:21.750 --> 02:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
u.s
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
fema reported 16 major disasters last
 
02:43:24.479 --> 02:43:25.269 align:start position:0%
fema reported 16 major disasters last
year

02:43:25.269 --> 02:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
um there were actually five major
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
disaster declarations
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
over the past three years here in new
 
02:43:31.359 --> 02:43:32.389 align:start position:0%
over the past three years here in new
hampshire

02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:43:36.389 --> 02:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
and so eliminating barriers that hinder
 
02:43:39.349 --> 02:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
the response is really key to effective
 
02:43:39.359 --> 02:43:39.910 align:start position:0%
the response is really key to effective
um

02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
recovery and i think that the covet 19
 
02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:43.590 align:start position:0%
recovery and i think that the covet 19
pandemic

02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
underscores the importance of reliable
 
02:43:47.269 --> 02:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
communication networks as
 
02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
many of us continue to see what we're
 
02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
doing today working from home
 
02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:59.110 --> 02:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
the so our network employees came to us
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago um and
 
02:44:04.150 --> 02:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
senator brown is correct other states
 
02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
are doing this 32
 
02:44:09.269 --> 02:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
states have done this across the country
 
02:44:11.910 --> 02:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
um most recently connecticut at the end
 
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
of last year their session
 
02:44:17.190 --> 02:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh maine and vermont
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
also had this in place and our employees
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
basically came to us and others
 
02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
in the industry um with this issue of
 
02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
roadblocks and legal requirements
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
that are otherwise aimed at normal
 
02:44:33.590 --> 02:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
business conditions which
 
02:44:37.910 --> 02:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
respond to a disaster is not so
 
02:44:42.389 --> 02:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
we basically uh got together went to um
 
02:44:45.510 --> 02:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
csl they put uh
 
02:44:47.429 --> 02:44:47.439 align:start position:0%
we work with them putting a model
 
02:44:49.750 --> 02:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
together that um
 
02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
the basis of sb 103 is uh
 
02:44:56.230 --> 02:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
built on uh very similar to 32 other
 
02:44:56.240 --> 02:44:57.190 align:start position:0%
built on uh very similar to 32 other
states

02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:44:59.590 --> 02:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
and uh so that's that's really where we
 
02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
are today and i
 
02:45:03.670 --> 02:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
i just like to sort of finish up and uh
 
02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
big comment um the sra
 
02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
basically says in the fiscal note that
 
02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh the bill would result in an
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
indeterminable uh increase in revenue
 
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
um and i'm not an expert um and i don't
 
02:45:18.870 --> 02:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
argue that but i'll just say that i
 
02:45:24.389 --> 02:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
believe that the impact on revenue
 
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
is is de minimis this is not about a
 
02:45:29.429 --> 02:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
cost reduction for at t
 
02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
or or these other companies this is
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
really about getting um
 
02:45:35.670 --> 02:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
the network back up and running after a
 
02:45:37.990 --> 02:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
disaster um this is about creating
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
certainty and
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
um you know a swift response to network
 
02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:42.950 align:start position:0%
um you know a swift response to network
outages

02:45:42.950 --> 02:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
outages
 
02:45:46.469 --> 02:45:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh you might even would argue maybe
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
that um if you have networked this down
 
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
and no one able to use it that you're
 
02:45:51.910 --> 02:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
not generating
 
02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
um tax revenue for the state of new
 
02:45:55.269 --> 02:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire while it's down
 
02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
so this potentially could have an impact
 
02:45:59.670 --> 02:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
a positive impact
 
02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
on this so anyway
 
02:46:07.110 --> 02:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
sb 103 does not impact atp's operation
 
02:46:08.230 --> 02:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
or employees or any
 
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
business entity dealing with a crisis in
 
02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
who normally operate in new hampshire as
 
02:46:16.309 --> 02:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
atp does
 
02:46:19.269 --> 02:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
we are liable for the taxes the
 
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
registration the licensing or any other
 
02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:21.670 align:start position:0%
registration the licensing or any other
regular

02:46:21.670 --> 02:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
regular
 
02:46:23.910 --> 02:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
course of business requirement that will
 
02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:25.030 align:start position:0%
course of business requirement that will
continue

02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
under this bill so this again
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
is about bringing resources to new
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire during specifically a declared
 
02:46:34.950 --> 02:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
state of emergency by the governor of
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
the president
 
02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
our property and personnel from other
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
states which
 
02:46:43.269 --> 02:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
previously um has had no connection to
 
02:46:44.950 --> 02:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that's really what this is
 
02:46:46.309 --> 02:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
all about so
 
02:46:48.870 --> 02:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
um i'll stop there and answer any
 
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
questions if people have them
 
02:46:53.590 --> 02:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony mr smith
 
02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:54.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony mr smith
questions

02:46:54.790 --> 02:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:46:57.830 --> 02:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative romney
 
02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair thank you mr uh
 
02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:01.670 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair thank you mr uh
smith

02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
smith
 
02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
for your testimony now 18t is a large
 
02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
for your testimony now 18t is a large
company

02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
company
 
02:47:06.630 --> 02:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you have a footprint in most
 
02:47:07.910 --> 02:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
states in
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:14.950 --> 02:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
so how does this impact uh apportionment
 
02:47:18.790 --> 02:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
of taxes between states for your
 
02:47:21.990 --> 02:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
efforts so i'm trying to understand how
 
02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:47:24.630 --> 02:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
plays out i mean if there's an emergency
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
on the coast because the hurricane came
 
02:47:26.399 --> 02:47:27.349 align:start position:0%
on the coast because the hurricane came
through

02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:47:31.429 --> 02:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
and you sent a team from vermont to new
 
02:47:32.950 --> 02:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire because it didn't really
 
02:47:33.990 --> 02:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
impact vermont but it
 
02:47:37.269 --> 02:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
impacted new hampshire what does this
 
02:47:37.279 --> 02:47:37.670 align:start position:0%
impacted new hampshire what does this
bill

02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:47:40.710 --> 02:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
do to uh your
 
02:47:43.030 --> 02:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
how your profits uh taxes on your
 
02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:43.990 align:start position:0%
how your profits uh taxes on your
profits

02:47:43.990 --> 02:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
profits
 
02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
in a portion between the states is there
 
02:47:50.230 --> 02:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:52.230 --> 02:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
so it so i think you should probably be
 
02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
talking about the business profits tax
 
02:47:54.630 --> 02:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
and business
 
02:47:57.750 --> 02:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
tax if if it really wouldn't
 
02:48:00.150 --> 02:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
impact us certainly from a financial
 
02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:00.950 align:start position:0%
impact us certainly from a financial
standpoint

02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
um again we're here this year we're
 
02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
doing business with other states
 
02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
so if it wouldn't really that it
 
02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really impact that
 
02:48:12.230 --> 02:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
what this really addresses is um some
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
affiliates that don't do business
 
02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
in this state and um also
 
02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh third parties that that we get
 
02:48:24.710 --> 02:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
come in to help us whether it's um
 
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
delivering fuel to generators um which
 
02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
att is not in that business so we rely
 
02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
on third parties to do that um
 
02:48:37.269 --> 02:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
and it's as much about um here's
 
02:48:39.190 --> 02:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
here's another example where you might
 
02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
have an electrician that needs to come
 
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
in and do some work
 
02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
well if you're not if you're based in
 
02:48:45.750 --> 02:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
and are a master electrician you'd be
 
02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
licensed well if you bring
 
02:48:52.950 --> 02:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
a licensed election from
 
02:48:54.630 --> 02:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
connecticut he's probably not going to
 
02:48:56.950 --> 02:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
have a license in new hampshire
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
basically this bill is saying that's
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay if he's licensed
 
02:49:01.590 --> 02:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
under connecticut law and that's where
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
he's coming from he doesn't need to have
 
02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
a a license in new hampshire um
 
02:49:11.590 --> 02:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
during you know 10 days prior to
 
02:49:14.870 --> 02:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
the disaster relief declared emergency
 
02:49:17.670 --> 02:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
in 60 days following that's all this
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
bill's saying
 
02:49:22.150 --> 02:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
so it might licensing
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment provisions we have to ask
 
02:49:27.830 --> 02:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer employees to come in and help
 
02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:28.389 align:start position:0%
volunteer employees to come in and help
out

02:49:28.389 --> 02:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:49:29.910 --> 02:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
and some of the first things that they
 
02:49:31.510 --> 02:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
look at is well
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
do i have to file taxes in new hampshire
 
02:49:35.590 --> 02:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
now am i going to get another tax return
 
02:49:37.510 --> 02:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know what about fico what what about
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know how does this impact me
 
02:49:42.150 --> 02:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
and we just want all of that to go away
 
02:49:44.469 --> 02:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
um and that's really what this is all
 
02:49:44.479 --> 02:49:45.990 align:start position:0%
um and that's really what this is all
about

02:49:45.990 --> 02:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:49:50.150 --> 02:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:53.429 --> 02:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative jenny thank you mr
 
02:49:53.439 --> 02:49:54.309 align:start position:0%
representative jenny thank you mr
chairman

02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:49:56.230 --> 02:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr smith for taking my
 
02:49:58.630 --> 02:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
question um i guess i just have a
 
02:49:58.640 --> 02:49:59.110 align:start position:0%
question um i guess i just have a
question

02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
on um on the liabilities side of this if
 
02:50:05.429 --> 02:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
businesses are are are coming in that
 
02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire doesn't know
 
02:50:08.070 --> 02:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
who they are
 
02:50:10.230 --> 02:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
is for example in the case of att if
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
you're bringing in
 
02:50:14.309 --> 02:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
contractors who aren't licensed in the
 
02:50:15.510 --> 02:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
state the state doesn't know anything
 
02:50:16.150 --> 02:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
about them
 
02:50:18.150 --> 02:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
where does liability fall if there's
 
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
some issue with the contractor
 
02:50:23.830 --> 02:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
so in order to be a contractor of a t
 
02:50:25.269 --> 02:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
they have to have the attic
 
02:50:29.590 --> 02:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
liability um and um
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't know
 
02:50:36.070 --> 02:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
if i can answer that question it just
 
02:50:38.469 --> 02:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it really doesn't change
 
02:50:38.479 --> 02:50:39.590 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it really doesn't change
anything

02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:50:42.630 --> 02:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
um there is a uh
 
02:50:45.990 --> 02:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement um if requested by
 
02:50:47.910 --> 02:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
 
02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
um that is in this bill
 
02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
that would um if requested upon by the
 
02:50:55.349 --> 02:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
they would have to supply their name
 
02:50:59.110 --> 02:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
state of domicile
 
02:51:00.870 --> 02:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh principal business address telephone
 
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
number all of that information
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
and proof that they actually do have a
 
02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:06.389 align:start position:0%
and proof that they actually do have a
license

02:51:06.389 --> 02:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:51:08.710 --> 02:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
say in the state of connecticut to be an
 
02:51:09.910 --> 02:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
electrician so
 
02:51:13.030 --> 02:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's in place
 
02:51:15.030 --> 02:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers questions follow up
 
02:51:16.150 --> 02:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
follow up so i i did see that in the
 
02:51:18.960 --> 02:51:19.510 align:start position:0%
follow up so i i did see that in the
bill

02:51:19.510 --> 02:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
and uh that's good the only thing is
 
02:51:23.269 --> 02:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
that requires
 
02:51:26.309 --> 02:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh the state to request it if the state
 
02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
isn't aware
 
02:51:31.990 --> 02:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
and hasn't requested it um then uh
 
02:51:33.590 --> 02:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know i guess that that's just where
 
02:51:35.269 --> 02:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
my i'm not sure it's a problem i'm just
 
02:51:35.910 --> 02:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:51:37.590 --> 02:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know understand whether there is a
 
02:51:38.950 --> 02:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
problem there with
 
02:51:41.269 --> 02:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
liability uh in a case where the state
 
02:51:42.309 --> 02:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't know
 
02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
who it is i mean in the case of att
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you
 
02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
any contractor you're bringing on you've
 
02:51:49.510 --> 02:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
already made sure they have their own
 
02:51:53.110 --> 02:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
liability insurance um
 
02:51:55.510 --> 02:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
so i guess is there i guess the question
 
02:51:56.870 --> 02:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
is greater question is
 
02:51:59.830 --> 02:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
att may be acting responsibly um we
 
02:52:01.349 --> 02:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if other
 
02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
contractors are like and again maybe
 
02:52:04.870 --> 02:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
this isn't even a problem i just want to
 
02:52:07.110 --> 02:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
raise it as a is it a potential issue is
 
02:52:08.070 --> 02:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um and and i may not have the
 
02:52:12.710 --> 02:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
answer to that specifically
 
02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
i do have an example of where we had a
 
02:52:16.230 --> 02:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
contractor in
 
02:52:19.349 --> 02:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
doing some work on a uh on a site um
 
02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
this wasn't during an emergency but
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
they were a vendor and they may have
 
02:52:25.830 --> 02:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
even been an in-state
 
02:52:27.670 --> 02:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
vendor but they actually did some damage
 
02:52:30.150 --> 02:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
to some public safety equipment on
 
02:52:32.630 --> 02:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the tower we took full
 
02:52:34.389 --> 02:52:34.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility of it it was work that
 
02:52:35.429 --> 02:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
was being done
 
02:52:37.750 --> 02:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
for us we took full responsibility for
 
02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
it so
 
02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
again i'm not sure that answers your
 
02:52:42.630 --> 02:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
question um but there are 32 other
 
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
states that have
 
02:52:47.510 --> 02:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
very very similar bills to this
 
02:52:49.269 --> 02:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
and i have not heard of that as being an
 
02:52:51.670 --> 02:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
issue thank you
 
02:52:55.269 --> 02:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames
 
02:52:59.190 --> 02:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um i think you may have just
 
02:53:03.510 --> 02:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
answered my question with your reference
 
02:53:06.070 --> 02:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
to the 32 other states but
 
02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
my question follows up on my earlier
 
02:53:10.950 --> 02:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
question to senator bradley and that is
 
02:53:14.550 --> 02:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh can you speak to the degree to which
 
02:53:16.469 --> 02:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
other states
 
02:53:20.230 --> 02:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
um have or are in the process of acting
 
02:53:23.590 --> 02:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
on similar legislation of uh
 
02:53:25.910 --> 02:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
so enacted the provisions that are in
 
02:53:27.269 --> 02:53:27.279 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:53:30.550 --> 02:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so um 30 students 32 states already
 
02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:30.950 align:start position:0%
yeah so um 30 students 32 states already
have

02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:53:34.710 --> 02:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
very similar bills um i believe that uh
 
02:53:35.670 --> 02:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
while connecticut
 
02:53:39.990 --> 02:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
just um passed almost the identical bill
 
02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh i think in october november of last
 
02:53:43.990 --> 02:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
year right at the very end of their
 
02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:44.950 align:start position:0%
year right at the very end of their
session

02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
and uh uh tennessee was also
 
02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
um the state that just passed this
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
i want to say maybe even january of this
 
02:53:56.070 --> 02:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
year but very recently
 
02:53:59.349 --> 02:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:03.190 --> 02:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
is also in massachusetts
 
02:54:05.110 --> 02:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
i was involved with the main one maine
 
02:54:07.230 --> 02:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
was actually the first state back in
 
02:54:09.110 --> 02:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
2014 or 15
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
to put this into place um
 
02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
and vermont followed shortly after that
 
02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay good that's helpful as a follow-up
 
02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:20.150 align:start position:0%
okay good that's helpful as a follow-up
follow-up

02:54:20.150 --> 02:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:54:22.570 --> 02:54:22.580 align:start position:0%
question yeah
 
02:54:22.580 --> 02:54:24.150 align:start position:0%
question yeah
[Music]

02:54:24.150 --> 02:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
so following up on representative
 
02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:27.750 align:start position:0%
so following up on representative
genigion's

02:54:27.750 --> 02:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
genigion's
 
02:54:31.269 --> 02:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
question and perhaps you don't know but
 
02:54:33.190 --> 02:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
do you know whether in any of those
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
states there's
 
02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
been a a problem with liability with
 
02:54:41.030 --> 02:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
contractors coming in under this
 
02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:42.389 align:start position:0%
contractors coming in under this
umbrella

02:54:42.389 --> 02:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
umbrella
 
02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
who may not be properly insured
 
02:54:50.230 --> 02:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
or maybe irresponsible
 
02:54:53.750 --> 02:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
so um again i am not aware of that
 
02:54:56.870 --> 02:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
um i would say
 
02:55:00.150 --> 02:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
that this this model language has been
 
02:55:02.070 --> 02:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
around and probably been tweaked over
 
02:55:02.950 --> 02:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
the years
 
02:55:06.309 --> 02:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
if this was was an issue in some state
 
02:55:09.269 --> 02:55:09.279 align:start position:0%
or multiple states my assumption is that
 
02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
they would have
 
02:55:13.349 --> 02:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh changed the language to address that
 
02:55:16.230 --> 02:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
so i i really don't think that it's an
 
02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:16.630 align:start position:0%
so i i really don't think that it's an
issue

02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:55:19.030 --> 02:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
and again in a t's point and i think
 
02:55:20.150 --> 02:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:55:23.429 --> 02:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh lots of big multinational companies
 
02:55:25.269 --> 02:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
here in utilities um
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
i i think we would step up and um
 
02:55:30.870 --> 02:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
take full responsibility but again i
 
02:55:33.190 --> 02:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that's been an issue
 
02:55:35.910 --> 02:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
obviously thank you that's a good answer
 
02:55:37.269 --> 02:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:55:37.279 --> 02:55:41.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:55:41.510 --> 02:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i appreciate that you
 
02:55:46.309 --> 02:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
you made a comment that just kind of
 
02:55:47.349 --> 02:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
tweaked my
 
02:55:51.030 --> 02:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
curiosity mr smith uh you said you
 
02:55:53.349 --> 02:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
certainly you know in a disastrous
 
02:55:55.349 --> 02:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
situation you may call in somebody from
 
02:55:55.359 --> 02:55:56.309 align:start position:0%
situation you may call in somebody from
outside

02:55:56.309 --> 02:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
outside
 
02:55:58.469 --> 02:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire to refuel your
 
02:55:58.479 --> 02:55:59.510 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire to refuel your
generators

02:55:59.510 --> 02:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
generators
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
well that doesn't seem to be very cost
 
02:56:04.950 --> 02:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
effective number one
 
02:56:07.670 --> 02:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
you're hauling bulk fuel across state
 
02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:08.630 align:start position:0%
you're hauling bulk fuel across state
lines

02:56:08.630 --> 02:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
lines
 
02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is how would this
 
02:56:11.279 --> 02:56:11.830 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is how would this
bill

02:56:11.830 --> 02:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
not operate to deny
 
02:56:17.910 --> 02:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
business opportunities to new hampshire
 
02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:18.870 align:start position:0%
business opportunities to new hampshire
entities

02:56:18.870 --> 02:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
entities
 
02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
that may not be directly affiliated with
 
02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
you as a as a subscribed
 
02:56:25.670 --> 02:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
contractor already but are ready willing
 
02:56:26.630 --> 02:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
and able
 
02:56:32.389 --> 02:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:36.150 --> 02:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
well so the the fuel situation
 
02:56:39.670 --> 02:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert on on how we respond
 
02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
to disasters um i do know that we have
 
02:56:46.150 --> 02:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
um third parties whether they're in
 
02:56:47.349 --> 02:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
state or out of state
 
02:56:50.710 --> 02:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
um that that drive around a few
 
02:56:53.110 --> 02:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
steel trucks and and uh fill up our
 
02:56:54.630 --> 02:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
generators where needed
 
02:56:57.670 --> 02:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
there's lots of different types of um
 
02:57:00.550 --> 02:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh contractors that we would um either
 
02:57:01.990 --> 02:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
use within state and
 
02:57:05.030 --> 02:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know we we pay um you know seven
 
02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:05.510 align:start position:0%
you know we we pay um you know seven
million

02:57:05.510 --> 02:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:57:09.030 --> 02:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
in local estate taxes and um i don't
 
02:57:10.630 --> 02:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
have the figure in front of me but
 
02:57:13.830 --> 02:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
um spend millions of dollars on local
 
02:57:13.840 --> 02:57:14.710 align:start position:0%
um spend millions of dollars on local
in-state

02:57:14.710 --> 02:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
in-state
 
02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
um partners uh to do business goods and
 
02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:18.790 align:start position:0%
um partners uh to do business goods and
services

02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:57:21.910 --> 02:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
so uh you're right it would make much
 
02:57:24.070 --> 02:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
better business sense to bring
 
02:57:27.030 --> 02:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
um to to work local which we do you know
 
02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:27.990 align:start position:0%
um to to work local which we do you know
99

02:57:27.990 --> 02:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
99
 
02:57:30.630 --> 02:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
of the time i believe um and and we've
 
02:57:32.950 --> 02:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
got 150 employees
 
02:57:36.070 --> 02:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
155 here in the state that
 
02:57:38.790 --> 02:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
work here in the state um exclusively
 
02:57:39.670 --> 02:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
02:57:41.429 --> 02:57:41.439 align:start position:0%
unless they need to go to another state
 
02:57:43.429 --> 02:57:43.439 align:start position:0%
for an emergency so
 
02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
um in most cases we would do that but
 
02:57:46.870 --> 02:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:57:50.150 --> 02:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
maybe some specialties or you know we
 
02:57:53.190 --> 02:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
we've got assets that we bring in that
 
02:57:54.469 --> 02:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
we station
 
02:57:56.630 --> 02:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
we've got assets here in the state um as
 
02:57:58.550 --> 02:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
well um these
 
02:58:01.510 --> 02:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
satellite um cults or cows that we can
 
02:58:02.950 --> 02:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
put up a temporary
 
02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
sell site we've got those to state but
 
02:58:07.030 --> 02:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
we may need more than we have in state
 
02:58:09.269 --> 02:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
so we've got to get somebody from
 
02:58:12.230 --> 02:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
um again whether it's an att employee in
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
connecticut or new jersey
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
to drive these things up or maybe a
 
02:58:16.790 --> 02:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
third party
 
02:58:19.870 --> 02:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
to drive these things up we use a lot of
 
02:58:19.880 --> 02:58:21.190 align:start position:0%
to drive these things up we use a lot of
subcontractors

02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
subcontractors
 
02:58:23.590 --> 02:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
um both in and out of state so i hope
 
02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
are you all safe i've seen you thank you
 
02:58:32.630 --> 02:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:58:37.990 --> 02:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:40.230 --> 02:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i have two
 
02:58:41.910 --> 02:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
questions i'll take them one at a time
 
02:58:43.750 --> 02:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
02:58:46.150 --> 02:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh going back to representative
 
02:58:46.160 --> 02:58:47.750 align:start position:0%
uh going back to representative
jeanine's

02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
jeanine's
 
02:58:50.469 --> 02:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
question on the notification clause but
 
02:58:53.110 --> 02:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
setting aside the consideration of
 
02:58:57.510 --> 02:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
liability just the mechanics of notice
 
02:58:59.750 --> 02:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
seems to have it backwards how's the
 
02:59:01.750 --> 02:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
secretary of state going to divine the
 
02:59:01.760 --> 02:59:03.349 align:start position:0%
secretary of state going to divine the
presence

02:59:03.349 --> 02:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
presence
 
02:59:07.030 --> 02:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
of emergency workers um
 
02:59:12.469 --> 02:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
so would it would you have any objection
 
02:59:14.389 --> 02:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
if in the second line of that provision
 
02:59:16.550 --> 02:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
we simply deleted the three words upon
 
02:59:17.910 --> 02:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
request by
 
02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
and made notice mandatory to be
 
02:59:21.190 --> 02:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
initiated by
 
02:59:26.550 --> 02:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:29.269 --> 02:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what what's the question
 
02:59:29.279 --> 02:59:30.790 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what what's the question
specifically

02:59:30.790 --> 02:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:59:34.790 --> 02:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
if we take the words upon request by
 
02:59:36.790 --> 02:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
from the notice of the secretary of
 
02:59:36.800 --> 02:59:38.150 align:start position:0%
from the notice of the secretary of
state

02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:59:39.830 --> 02:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
then we eliminate the need for the
 
02:59:41.670 --> 02:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
02:59:43.670 --> 02:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
to divine your presence and request a
 
02:59:43.680 --> 02:59:46.710 align:start position:0%
to divine your presence and request a
notice

02:59:46.710 --> 02:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
you just simply say you have your pride
 
02:59:51.269 --> 02:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
and notice any objections
 
02:59:54.389 --> 02:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
um i mean i i understand
 
02:59:56.150 --> 02:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
why you would want to do that but but
 
02:59:58.309 --> 02:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
this this bill
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
is all about streamlining and and again
 
03:00:03.670 --> 03:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that the liability issue
 
03:00:03.680 --> 03:00:04.309 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that the liability issue
is

03:00:04.309 --> 03:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:00:06.070 --> 03:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
is truly an issue or it would be
 
03:00:07.670 --> 03:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
specifically addressed in
 
03:00:10.870 --> 03:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
this bill and in 30 my question has
 
03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with reliability it's just
 
03:00:14.870 --> 03:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
about notice
 
03:00:17.830 --> 03:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay um you know taking that out would
 
03:00:19.030 --> 03:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
03:00:21.429 --> 03:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh put a process in place that's not in
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
place today
 
03:00:26.389 --> 03:00:26.399 align:start position:0%
that would um uh make us
 
03:00:27.990 --> 03:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
take that step and that that's what
 
03:00:30.230 --> 03:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to avoid here
 
03:00:33.349 --> 03:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
is streamlining it and making it very
 
03:00:36.070 --> 03:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully identical in all 50 states so
 
03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
if we've got a
 
03:00:41.269 --> 03:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
storm that came up and we we were in
 
03:00:43.110 --> 03:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
multiple states and moving people from
 
03:00:45.030 --> 03:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
each state we wouldn't have to
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
worry about in new hampshire we've got
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
to notify the
 
03:00:51.349 --> 03:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state um so really what
 
03:00:53.349 --> 03:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is streamline
 
03:00:56.309 --> 03:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
the operations the the um the process
 
03:00:58.230 --> 03:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
involved in getting employees and assets
 
03:01:02.150 --> 03:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:06.710 --> 03:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay your second question
 
03:01:10.469 --> 03:01:10.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh so out of state
 
03:01:10.479 --> 03:01:11.349 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh so out of state
business

03:01:11.349 --> 03:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:01:14.469 --> 03:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
in chapter
 
03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
5 319 d5
 
03:01:23.910 --> 03:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
is uh defined not to have a presence in
 
03:01:25.830 --> 03:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
the state now in the case of 18t do you
 
03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:26.469 align:start position:0%
the state now in the case of 18t do you
have

03:01:26.469 --> 03:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:01:28.469 --> 03:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
a distinct corporate affiliate operating
 
03:01:30.070 --> 03:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
in each state
 
03:01:31.990 --> 03:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
and so effectively when you bring in
 
03:01:33.590 --> 03:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
property or employees they're coming
 
03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:34.070 align:start position:0%
property or employees they're coming
from

03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:01:36.230 --> 03:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
a different corporate entity is that
 
03:01:36.240 --> 03:01:37.830 align:start position:0%
a different corporate entity is that
basically

03:01:37.830 --> 03:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:01:41.030 --> 03:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:49.510 --> 03:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on mr smith
 
03:01:52.550 --> 03:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
on that same one on the bottom of
 
03:01:55.670 --> 03:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
page 1 roman
 
03:01:58.710 --> 03:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
8 registered business
 
03:02:02.630 --> 03:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
is defined on a place
 
03:02:06.389 --> 03:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
in in this that specifies
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
that what we're talking about is
 
03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:10.070 align:start position:0%
that what we're talking about is
businesses

03:02:10.070 --> 03:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
03:02:14.830 --> 03:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
that are specifically um
 
03:02:18.790 --> 03:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
on telecommunications and utilities
 
03:02:22.469 --> 03:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
or could it also apply to
 
03:02:26.230 --> 03:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
a um dunking
 
03:02:29.269 --> 03:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
dunking donuts franchises
 
03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
from outside or somebody like that that
 
03:02:33.510 --> 03:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
was going to bring in emergency
 
03:02:37.510 --> 03:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
food supplies on and groups that
 
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
that would be a lot less organized the
 
03:02:42.630 --> 03:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
way you want to be organized and should
 
03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
be organized
 
03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:52.870 --> 03:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
focused at repairing
 
03:02:57.269 --> 03:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
and restoring physical equipment
 
03:03:01.269 --> 03:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
and buildings and infrastructure
 
03:03:03.510 --> 03:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it would pertain to
 
03:03:05.429 --> 03:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
dunkin donuts bringing in
 
03:03:10.469 --> 03:03:10.479 align:start position:0%
food for att workers or anybody else
 
03:03:12.309 --> 03:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
so no i don't so i think it's pretty
 
03:03:13.750 --> 03:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
specific on
 
03:03:15.910 --> 03:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh what kind of a business this would
 
03:03:17.910 --> 03:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the work that they're doing
 
03:03:21.030 --> 03:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
would uh qualify under this
 
03:03:23.429 --> 03:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
and is that in the language somewhere
 
03:03:25.750 --> 03:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
sorry follow-up
 
03:03:32.469 --> 03:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
status of out-of-state business uh let's
 
03:03:35.359 --> 03:03:37.910 align:start position:0%
status of out-of-state business uh let's
see

03:04:41.510 --> 03:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
it looks like day two

the trajectory paragraph may
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
may specify that
 
03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
but yeah critical infrastructure exactly

03:05:29.590 --> 03:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
i think so but i couldn't find the place
 
03:05:31.269 --> 03:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
he was reading from i was reading from
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
line six to ten
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
on page yeah that that's i was just
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
reading from that too
 
03:05:42.550 --> 03:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:46.790 --> 03:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's actually line um yes
 
03:05:50.469 --> 03:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
on page uh page one
 
03:05:53.429 --> 03:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me yeah uh it's line seven eight
 
03:05:56.469 --> 03:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:58.790 --> 03:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's a definition and then critical
 
03:05:59.990 --> 03:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure isn't
 
03:06:03.349 --> 03:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
used in page 2
 
03:06:07.910 --> 03:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh line 6 to 10.
 
03:06:12.230 --> 03:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
yeah mr chair perhaps i could help
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes i think
 
03:06:17.429 --> 03:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
you have to put things together here i
 
03:06:19.190 --> 03:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty well done
 
03:06:20.790 --> 03:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
the the definition of critical
 
03:06:22.309 --> 03:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we were just talking
 
03:06:22.319 --> 03:06:23.510 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we were just talking
about

03:06:23.510 --> 03:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
then that keys into the next definition
 
03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
which is disaster related or emergency
 
03:06:29.990 --> 03:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
related work
 
03:06:31.990 --> 03:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
which is repairing renovating and so
 
03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:33.030 align:start position:0%
which is repairing renovating and so
forth

03:06:33.030 --> 03:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
forth
 
03:06:35.190 --> 03:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
to critical infrastructure so it's
 
03:06:36.950 --> 03:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
picking up the critical infrastructure
 
03:06:36.960 --> 03:06:37.910 align:start position:0%
picking up the critical infrastructure
there

03:06:37.910 --> 03:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:06:40.870 --> 03:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then if you go to the sort of the
 
03:06:43.590 --> 03:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
focus of the bill which is the status of
 
03:06:48.309 --> 03:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
out-of-state businesses on the page two
 
03:06:51.190 --> 03:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
the provision is that no out-of-state
 
03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
business or out-of-state
 
03:06:55.990 --> 03:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
employee who is present in the state or
 
03:06:58.230 --> 03:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
conducts operations in the state to
 
03:07:00.630 --> 03:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
perform disaster related or emergency
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
related work that's the definition we
 
03:07:03.030 --> 03:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
were just
 
03:07:06.870 --> 03:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
looking at um thank you
 
03:07:17.429 --> 03:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:21.110 --> 03:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
we have one other person signed up
 
03:07:22.830 --> 03:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill but not
 
03:07:22.840 --> 03:07:26.469 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill but not
testifying

03:07:26.469 --> 03:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:29.429 --> 03:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
and that's more a western lobbyist from
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
new england cable and telecommunications
 
03:07:31.680 --> 03:07:32.870 align:start position:0%

letter from a gerard keegan
 
03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
from cedar ragan which is another
 
03:07:45.830 --> 03:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
wireless communication industry in
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:52.710 --> 03:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
the only thing i want is
 
03:07:55.429 --> 03:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
carolyn lear from the dra is here do you
 
03:07:56.230 --> 03:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
have anything
 
03:08:01.830 --> 03:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:03.910 --> 03:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative carolyn lear
 
03:08:05.269 --> 03:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner at the new
 
03:08:07.590 --> 03:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of revenue
 
03:08:10.469 --> 03:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
you have the bill with our fiscal impact
 
03:08:10.479 --> 03:08:12.389 align:start position:0%
you have the bill with our fiscal impact
statement

03:08:12.389 --> 03:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
statement
 
03:08:15.269 --> 03:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
at the back of the bill and i think
 
03:08:17.070 --> 03:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
that's relatively
 
03:08:19.510 --> 03:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory i think the proposed
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
legislation could result in businesses
 
03:08:24.790 --> 03:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
not having nexus with new hampshire for
 
03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
disaster recovery work
 
03:08:29.670 --> 03:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
here in the state um
 
03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
who would no longer have nexus if this
 
03:08:35.349 --> 03:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
bill were passed and that is why we
 
03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
have indicated that there would be a um
 
03:08:40.150 --> 03:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
indeterminable reduction
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
in revenue um i'm happy to answer any
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee has
 
03:08:49.670 --> 03:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
about that
 
03:08:53.990 --> 03:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman
 
03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
helen on none of the
 
03:09:01.269 --> 03:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
if a business had some kind of nexus
 
03:09:04.710 --> 03:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
now on but on
 
03:09:07.670 --> 03:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
was based outside of new hampshire and
 
03:09:09.830 --> 03:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
provided emergency services
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
under this would they be at all
 
03:09:18.469 --> 03:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
could you still continue to tax them for
 
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
the nexus they had
 
03:09:23.830 --> 03:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise i interpret the answer to
 
03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
i interpret the bill um as saying that
 
03:09:26.960 --> 03:09:27.830 align:start position:0%
i interpret the bill um as saying that
yes

03:09:27.830 --> 03:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:09:30.790 --> 03:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's more of a but four situation where
 
03:09:30.800 --> 03:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
it's more of a but four situation where
but

03:09:31.110 --> 03:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:09:33.750 --> 03:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
for the disaster the business would not
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
have nexus
 
03:09:38.070 --> 03:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
then we would not capture them but if
 
03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
they would all
 
03:09:40.229 --> 03:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
if they would have nexus otherwise i
 
03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill impacts them
 
03:09:48.790 --> 03:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so this would just be possible
 
03:09:50.790 --> 03:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
future revenue that would be based on
 
03:09:53.510 --> 03:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
their having come to help us
 
03:09:58.309 --> 03:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
that's how i interpret the language
 
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:06.790 --> 03:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'm sorry uh representative
 
03:10:06.800 --> 03:10:08.630 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'm sorry uh representative
ginagian

03:10:08.630 --> 03:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
ginagian
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative your question thank
 
03:10:12.710 --> 03:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman i couldn't get to ray's
 
03:10:12.720 --> 03:10:13.349 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman i couldn't get to ray's
hand

03:10:13.349 --> 03:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
hand
 
03:10:16.870 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
fast enough um so going back to
 
03:10:18.309 --> 03:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative spilbury's
 
03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
spielsberg's question um in section 319
 
03:10:25.429 --> 03:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
d column three um we're moving upon
 
03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
request by the secretary of state
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
um that would then mean that the
 
03:10:33.990 --> 03:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire would have the
 
03:10:36.550 --> 03:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
name and so forth of each business
 
03:10:40.309 --> 03:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
that is um involved and would i guess my
 
03:10:40.319 --> 03:10:41.670 align:start position:0%
that is um involved and would i guess my
question

03:10:41.670 --> 03:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:10:45.349 --> 03:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
um would be would that help
 
03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
in making sure that revenue was not lost
 
03:10:49.590 --> 03:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
by being able to account for
 
03:10:51.429 --> 03:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
who was in the state and who did work i
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
mean i i realized that
 
03:10:55.910 --> 03:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to minimize the the red
 
03:10:55.920 --> 03:10:56.710 align:start position:0%
we're trying to minimize the the red
tape

03:10:56.710 --> 03:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
tape
 
03:10:58.790 --> 03:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
with this bill but i'm just wondering as
 
03:11:00.229 --> 03:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
i look at this how much red tape it
 
03:11:01.830 --> 03:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
really would be to give your name
 
03:11:03.670 --> 03:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
state of domicile and so forth as we
 
03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
look at sections a through
 
03:11:10.309 --> 03:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
g or h i'm gonna turn the page here uh
 
03:11:12.070 --> 03:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
through h it doesn't seem to be an
 
03:11:13.750 --> 03:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
onerous requirement
 
03:11:16.790 --> 03:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
to to do that and if that was done
 
03:11:20.150 --> 03:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
would that help uh revenues
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:25.269 --> 03:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:11:27.670 --> 03:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative i don't that could
 
03:11:29.750 --> 03:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
certainly be a potentially helpful
 
03:11:32.950 --> 03:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
compliance tool um but i don't know that
 
03:11:32.960 --> 03:11:33.830 align:start position:0%
compliance tool um but i don't know that
that

03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:11:36.630 --> 03:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
overall would impact the revenue outcome
 
03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:37.670 align:start position:0%
overall would impact the revenue outcome
here

03:11:37.670 --> 03:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:11:41.190 --> 03:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
registration alone will not under this
 
03:11:42.710 --> 03:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
bill determine whether
 
03:11:45.349 --> 03:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
an entity is subject to taxation it is
 
03:11:47.110 --> 03:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not they have nexus
 
03:11:50.309 --> 03:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
and in this instance the bill provides
 
03:11:53.030 --> 03:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
that for disaster related responses as
 
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
outlined in the bill
 
03:11:57.910 --> 03:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
nexus will not exist and therefore taxes
 
03:11:58.710 --> 03:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
will not be
 
03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
owed okay thank you any further
 
03:12:04.560 --> 03:12:06.150 align:start position:0%
owed okay thank you any further
questions

03:12:06.150 --> 03:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:12:11.110 --> 03:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:15.910 --> 03:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
saying none then i'm going to any uh
 
03:12:18.070 --> 03:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else in the attendees
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
list janine
 
03:12:22.389 --> 03:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
no no there's not then i'm going to
 
03:12:24.150 --> 03:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on
 
03:12:28.150 --> 03:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
senate bill 103. gosh
 
03:12:32.710 --> 03:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:12:35.269 --> 03:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
that takes care of the public hearings
 
03:12:36.950 --> 03:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
now tomorrow
 
03:12:40.870 --> 03:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
starts a new era when we go back to
 
03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:43.990 align:start position:0%
starts a new era when we go back to
revenues

03:12:43.990 --> 03:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:47.990 --> 03:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:50.870 --> 03:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
i believe three spreadsheets this
 
03:12:50.880 --> 03:12:53.269 align:start position:0%
i believe three spreadsheets this
afternoon

03:12:53.269 --> 03:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
03:12:58.469 --> 03:12:58.479 align:start position:0%
one has to do with the
 
03:13:01.590 --> 03:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
latest dra estimates that they came up
 
03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:02.469 align:start position:0%
latest dra estimates that they came up
with

03:13:02.469 --> 03:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:13:05.750 --> 03:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
for men and max for their dra type
 
03:13:05.760 --> 03:13:09.510 align:start position:0%
for men and max for their dra type
revenues

03:13:09.510 --> 03:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:13.349 --> 03:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
another one would be a modified
 
03:13:17.030 --> 03:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
worksheet at the dr8 that the lba put
 
03:13:17.040 --> 03:13:17.830 align:start position:0%
worksheet at the dr8 that the lba put
together

03:13:17.830 --> 03:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
for us where we generated the revenues
 
03:13:25.269 --> 03:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
for the house resolution 11
 
03:13:29.750 --> 03:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
and what i've asked them to do
 
03:13:32.630 --> 03:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
is to remove those lines on that
 
03:13:32.640 --> 03:13:36.070 align:start position:0%
is to remove those lines on that
worksheet

03:13:36.070 --> 03:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:39.110 --> 03:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with the governor minus
 
03:13:46.229 --> 03:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:49.510 --> 03:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
and then put a new line in which will
 
03:13:49.520 --> 03:13:50.150 align:start position:0%
and then put a new line in which will
say

03:13:50.150 --> 03:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
the committee agreed to estimates on
 
03:13:57.190 --> 03:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
3 18 21
 
03:13:59.190 --> 03:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
so this will be a working document that
 
03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
we'll go through
 
03:14:08.830 --> 03:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:08.840 --> 03:14:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
spreadsheet

03:14:10.790 --> 03:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
03:14:14.229 --> 03:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
is one that puts together
 
03:14:17.990 --> 03:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
the revenue effect of all the house bill
 
03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
2 items that affect revenues
 
03:14:23.830 --> 03:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
that we know about that we went through
 
03:14:25.030 --> 03:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
the other day
 
03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
and then have been modified since
 
03:14:31.830 --> 03:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
so if you review those three that will
 
03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:32.950 align:start position:0%
so if you review those three that will
help

03:14:32.950 --> 03:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:14:36.070 --> 03:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
when we bring the dra in to go over all
 
03:14:38.309 --> 03:14:38.319 align:start position:0%
their revenues
 
03:14:41.429 --> 03:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
that'll probably and then uh
 
03:14:44.070 --> 03:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
that will probably take the whole most
 
03:14:45.990 --> 03:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
of the first day
 
03:14:48.790 --> 03:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
the second day we'll bring in those
 
03:14:48.800 --> 03:14:50.150 align:start position:0%
the second day we'll bring in those
agencies

03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
03:14:53.269 --> 03:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
that would have been affected by
 
03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
the economy and what i mean by that
 
03:15:00.150 --> 03:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
is an effect would be more and more
 
03:15:00.160 --> 03:15:00.550 align:start position:0%
is an effect would be more and more
people

03:15:00.550 --> 03:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:15:03.910 --> 03:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
getting vaccinated now so that's going
 
03:15:04.950 --> 03:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
to have an effect
 
03:15:08.469 --> 03:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
on maybe a positive effect on worms and
 
03:15:08.479 --> 03:15:09.510 align:start position:0%
on maybe a positive effect on worms and
males

03:15:09.510 --> 03:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
males
 
03:15:11.830 --> 03:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
the stimulus check the stimulus monies
 
03:15:12.870 --> 03:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
and we've got and by that time we'll
 
03:15:16.150 --> 03:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
know more
 
03:15:19.590 --> 03:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
what that will do for us and that
 
03:15:22.630 --> 03:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
will affect our revenues everything
 
03:15:26.389 --> 03:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
that will affect our revenues up until
 
03:15:29.429 --> 03:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
the 18th when we come up with our new
 
03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:36.950 --> 03:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
caused by anything we put that that's in
 
03:15:38.630 --> 03:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
03:15:41.190 --> 03:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
and anything that is caused by the
 
03:15:41.200 --> 03:15:42.150 align:start position:0%
and anything that is caused by the
economy

03:15:42.150 --> 03:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
economy
 
03:15:43.990 --> 03:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
that will affect the revenues that we
 
03:15:45.750 --> 03:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
already generated from
 
03:15:49.750 --> 03:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
hr 11. so we need to accomplish this
 
03:15:52.389 --> 03:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
over the next two days because the
 
03:15:54.229 --> 03:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
finance committee needs
 
03:15:57.190 --> 03:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
our best guesstimates at that point so
 
03:15:57.830 --> 03:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
they can
 
03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
do their work and have it done for next
 
03:16:00.840 --> 03:16:03.349 align:start position:0%
do their work and have it done for next
week

03:16:03.349 --> 03:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
week
 
03:16:05.590 --> 03:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
any questions on that i'll be sending
 
03:16:09.110 --> 03:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
you those those three spreadsheets
 
03:16:12.389 --> 03:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman yes are you thinking that
 
03:16:14.150 --> 03:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
the afternoon will be something like one
 
03:16:16.950 --> 03:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
to three
 
03:16:16.960 --> 03:16:21.349 align:start position:0%
to three
um

03:16:21.349 --> 03:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:23.590 --> 03:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
depends on the number of questions and
 
03:16:23.600 --> 03:16:24.550 align:start position:0%
depends on the number of questions and
yeah

03:16:24.550 --> 03:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
oh we perceived i i think
 
03:16:33.510 --> 03:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:38.309 --> 03:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:44.309 --> 03:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
and then what we have to do
 
03:16:49.190 --> 03:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
on thursday you know today is tuesday
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
on thursday we should be through
 
03:16:55.990 --> 03:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
our interrogating in the morning and
 
03:16:58.070 --> 03:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
then in the afternoon
 
03:17:02.870 --> 03:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh mr chairman i think he's
 
03:17:07.190 --> 03:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
asking because
 
03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
the democrats have been called to a
 
03:17:12.550 --> 03:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
caucus starting at three on thursday
 
03:17:15.510 --> 03:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
and some of our members may stay some of
 
03:17:18.150 --> 03:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
them may not be able to
 
03:17:21.429 --> 03:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
feel they can't so
 
03:17:24.710 --> 03:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
we will be able to discuss
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
the effects of the federal stimulus and
 
03:17:29.110 --> 03:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
the vaccines also on
 
03:17:36.229 --> 03:17:36.239 align:start position:0%

i'm hoping actually we can get started
on

03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:17:49.750 --> 03:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:52.790 --> 03:17:52.800 align:start position:0%

03:18:00.229 --> 03:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
interrogate the other agencies in the
 
03:18:00.239 --> 03:18:01.030 align:start position:0%

morning
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
and hopefully exact in the afternoon
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
we might even be able to do some of our
 
03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
exactly in the morning on
 
03:18:12.630 --> 03:18:12.640 align:start position:0%

03:18:20.070 --> 03:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
and is that debate thank you questions
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
or comments
 
03:18:20.880 --> 03:18:24.550 align:start position:0%
or comments
mr

03:18:24.550 --> 03:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:28.469 --> 03:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh is the plan to uh have the controller
 
03:18:30.550 --> 03:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
and the treasurer first thing tomorrow
 
03:18:32.150 --> 03:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
morning to deal with the uh
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
credit card forward issue right the
 
03:18:36.150 --> 03:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
first thing in the morning
 
03:18:39.590 --> 03:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
we'll have the controller the treasurer
 
03:18:42.870 --> 03:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
and the dra so we can
 
03:18:46.469 --> 03:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
discuss that those lines on the
 
03:18:47.429 --> 03:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
worksheet that i'm
 
03:18:50.469 --> 03:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
sending you has to do with
 
03:18:54.070 --> 03:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward a credit
 
03:18:59.110 --> 03:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:03.510 --> 03:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
is a tough issue it may
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
force uh delay in that
 
03:19:09.429 --> 03:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
but before we even do anything we need
 
03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
what this really means is it legal what
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
we've been doing
 
03:19:17.429 --> 03:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
is a good accounting practice what we've
 
03:19:19.110 --> 03:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
been doing
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
and that will determine what action we
 
03:19:24.389 --> 03:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
need to take after that
 
03:19:34.550 --> 03:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:39.429 --> 03:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
so then after this all goes away
 
03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
then we can get to the uh ppp
 
03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
funds but i i don't want to complicate
 
03:19:47.910 --> 03:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
things until
 
03:19:50.229 --> 03:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
we get the revenues for the budgets
 
03:19:53.510 --> 03:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:54.630 --> 03:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
norm do you know if the senate is going
 
03:19:56.710 --> 03:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
to be voting out that ppp bill pretty
 
03:19:56.720 --> 03:19:58.950 align:start position:0%
to be voting out that ppp bill pretty
soon

03:19:58.950 --> 03:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
soon
 
03:20:01.510 --> 03:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
do we know where that stands yeah i only
 
03:20:03.349 --> 03:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
i only wish they would do the same thing
 
03:20:05.429 --> 03:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
as they did for the meals and rooms
 
03:20:08.469 --> 03:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
what they did they voted unanimously
 
03:20:12.070 --> 03:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
to give the 40 of the meals and rooms
 
03:20:14.950 --> 03:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
to the towns and then they tabled it and
 
03:20:17.030 --> 03:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
the reason for tabling is when they get
 
03:20:18.630 --> 03:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:20:21.910 --> 03:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill from us then it gives them an
 
03:20:22.950 --> 03:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
03:20:26.630 --> 03:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
add it to the budget bill
 
03:20:29.269 --> 03:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
and uh they may do the same thing with
 
03:20:30.550 --> 03:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
the pvp
 
03:20:34.229 --> 03:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
but if they do that we still need to
 
03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:40.950 --> 03:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that bill mr chair
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
may not come to us
 
03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:46.550 align:start position:0%
may not come to us
formally

03:20:46.550 --> 03:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:48.870 --> 03:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
the bill will not come to us formally
 
03:20:51.110 --> 03:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
right and then they can
 
03:20:53.910 --> 03:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
they won't have to worry about us
 
03:20:55.429 --> 03:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
putting it into the
 
03:21:00.309 --> 03:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:03.429 --> 03:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
settled at the committee of conference
 
03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
all right but if we've discussed it
 
03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
ahead of time we have more chance in the
 
03:21:09.750 --> 03:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
03:21:09.760 --> 03:21:14.790 align:start position:0%
committee of conference

03:21:14.790 --> 03:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
