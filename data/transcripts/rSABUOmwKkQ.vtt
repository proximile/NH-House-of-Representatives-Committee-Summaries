00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
all right guys I think we have a Quorum
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
at this
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.710 align:start position:0%
 
started

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.789 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
doesn't but she sits right in front of
 
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.350 align:start position:0%
 
okaying

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
stra oh thank you
 
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin if you wouldn't mind just
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
probably sitting close to the mic I'm
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
sure we're going to need you so you
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to keep getting up and
 
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
down all right so I'd like to open up
 
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
the work session on HB 1647 hb1 1653 and
 
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.909 align:start position:0%
the work session on HB 1647 hb1 1653 and
HB

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
1673 um and start by saying I think the
 
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
reason why I would like to address these
 
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
three bills um together is because if
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
all passed uh they affect each other in
 
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
pretty dramatic fashion um from a
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
financial uh
 
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
perspective and so um
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'll just actually just um ask the
 
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
question to the room for the people who
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
are here and involved uh I am assuming
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
that HB 1647 at members of the committee
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
primarily towards you um seems like the
 
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
priority piece of legislation um is
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
there anybody who does not feel out of
 
00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 align:start position:0%
these three if only one were to pass at
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
legislation okay I didn't think I
 
00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 align:start position:0%
thought probably everybody felt that way
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
um it has a benefit not only to the
 
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
group of employees from 2001 to 2012 but
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
it also affects um all of the um new
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
hires moving forward by upping their
 
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
multiplier um so I would like to start
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh looking at well actually let me just
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
say this for the members of the
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh and anybody else who's
 
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
listening um we know that the the
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
opening for 16477 itself has some
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
limitations to it
 
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
um the difficulty with this legislation
 
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
not from a fairness perspective or
 
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
anything else is the farther we get away
 
00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
from the point of origin the more
 
00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
expensive it gets to go back and fix
 
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
things um because the money hasn't been
 
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
in the system to acrw Value over time
 
00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
and so every year that something doesn't
 
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
pass it gets more expensive to implement
 
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
it the next year and it'll get more
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
expensive than next year um Mr Carlin
 
00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
handed out to the members of the
 
00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879 align:start position:0%
committee um a he just passed out a
 
00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
sheet that shows the financial impact of
 
00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
these bills um just at face value so
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at 1647 we're looking
 
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
at $ 55.9 million uh when we're looking
 
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
at 1653 we're looking at 26.6 and 1673
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
is $18.5 million if you put all that
 
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
together um at face value it's over
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um but because the other two
 
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
which one are this one here
 
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
100,000 100 million sorry yeah that's a
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
big difference I'm that completely
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
aw I'm just trying to trying to hurry
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
Peter so I apologize um but because the
 
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
other two will affect um
 
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
1647 um the cost is going to be much
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
much higher than $100
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
million um so I'm kind my personal
 
00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 align:start position:0%
perspective and then I'd love to hear
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts from other members of the
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
committee first um um at this point
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
being 12 years away from kind of the
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
Inception of when these things happened
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
um we're kind of on a chess board that
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
no longer has a queen and we're maybe
 
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
down in Rook as well um and uh so I I'm
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
tentative to really um push very hard
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
for 1653 and 1673 my starting position
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
on those two is to move interim study
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if any members of the
 
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
committee have any definition feelings
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
at this point uh and then of course I'll
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
open it up to people in the room if they
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
well do anybody really opposed to interm
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:06.829 align:start position:0%
 
room

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
the yes um so we're just I was just
 
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
talking um about the fact that uh we're
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
we're making
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
1647 pretty much priority um and that uh
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
my initial gut is to move interim study
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
on both HP 1653 and
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
1673 and if anybody uh nobody on the
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
committee wants to speak to that so if
 
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
anybody in the room wants to speak to
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to open that up to
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
people in the room before we dig into
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
microphone so
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
I for the record Representative Steve
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
Pearson Rockingham District 13 Derry uh
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
Ju Just to mind the subcommittee here
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
these these two pieces of legislation
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
potential legislation here are sub
 
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.389 align:start position:0%
potential legislation here are sub
elements

00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
of 436 is what they are they're they're
 
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
just they're just uh portions of 436
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
that were drawn out uh the the idea of
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
that um and the reason they exist is
 
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.269 align:start position:0%
that um and the reason they exist is
because

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
of I'm aware of the House's position on
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
1647 I have confidence in The house's
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
position on
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
1647 but that confidence stops at the
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
wall so if you get what I'm saying
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
pretty hard I think yes so the purpose
 
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
of these two is to allow another
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism if necessary that that's
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's where um that's where that's
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
where these came from and also too just
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
to get an idea because of the
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
constraints that we we still have in the
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
ability to get data from the retirement
 
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
system due to the fact that they just
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's not free um this gave an idea of
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
what some of the sub portions of 436
 
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.590 align:start position:0%
what some of the sub portions of 436
were

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
because that was looked at holistically
 
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
right because it it did one thing right
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
and this just kind of covered some
 
00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:22.839 align:start position:0%
elements of that just to see what
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
portions of
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
that how much different concepts within
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
436 cost if they were broken out
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
um so that's where these come from if if
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
the position of Edna is a full support
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
of 1647 that
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
is certainly acceptable and that is the
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
as the commission over the
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
summer reached an agreement on that that
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
does move the pendulum forward um so we
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know there's no there is no attempt
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
or desire to
 
00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
derail that in any way so is just so
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
that you guys understand you know where
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
this where these other two bills are
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
coming from sure so interim study is
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
going to accomplish that it can it can
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
accomplish that um even even I would
 
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
almost ask
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
that we table one of the two of them
 
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
just just to have just to have something
 
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
as a mechanism if things go crazy when
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
it crosses over but we can still move
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
interim study and then move to table
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely yep okay great
 
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
thank you peon appreciate it um so with
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
that said we'll we'll deal with those
 
00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:35.959 align:start position:0%
maybe later in this session um I'd like
 
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
to move real quick though to 1647 um
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
just because I don't know how much time
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to need on it and I want to
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can keep the ball
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
rolling um Mr Carlin I have a question
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
on um page two line two uh which refers
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
to the limits under RSA 100 a6a you're
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
speaking in 164 yeah in the actual bill
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
of 1647 yeah limits under RSA a6a which
 
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear to refer to anything
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
um okay this the a6a speaks to the
 
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
maximum retirement benefit um you know
 
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
which is the lesser of
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
$120,000 or
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
85% of the member's average final
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
compensation uh for anyone who commends
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
service on or after July one of 09 and
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
had not become vested prior to January
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
1st of 2012 so by incorporating
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
reference to that here the uh the
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
section of um H uh hb6
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
47 that you were referring to it uh
 
00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:05.759 align:start position:0%
addresses the um
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
disability accidental disability
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions so so for accidental
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
disability for group two um the the
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
minimum payable is is
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
66.66% of uh of pay so that's you know
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
2third so the supplemental disability in
 
00:14:28.749 --> 00:14:28.759 align:start position:0%
the statute right now uh is a protection
 
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
SLT trigger if someone was injured so
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
far into their career that with the
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
multiplier they would have acred a
 
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:37.959 align:start position:0%
larger percentage of their a see than
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
2/3 um the the uh you know the um that
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
is applied to the um you know so they
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
get that on top of the you know The
 
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
Accidental 2third plus plus anything
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
extra um it it does say you can't get
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
100% of your AFC otherwise or the AFC so
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
because you have the the different steps
 
00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:01.759 align:start position:0%
in tier B and and then you also have
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
tier C there's five different maximum
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
amounts of years and months that you can
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
work when you until you get to 85% you
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
know or 100% you know if you're in tier
 
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
a so rather than enumerating them all
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
here where um you know it's you know you
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
know 28 and 23ds months for somebody two
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
twoth thirds years for somebody and you
 
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.590 align:start position:0%
twoth thirds years for somebody and you
know

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
29.4 years for somebody in a different
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
tier it it just the intent of referring
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
back to A6 was to keep though all of
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
those percentages out of this section
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay so you feel like that references
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we we we do as a retirement system
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yeah I just wanted to make
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
sure on that um any questions from
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
anybody on the
 
00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.350 align:start position:0%
anybody on the
committee

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right so and then that comes up
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
again later on
 
00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start position:0%
as well so as long as we're comfortable
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
with that the retirement system is
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that I'm fine with it
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
um so other other than that unless
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee have any
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
questions we do have um a potential
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I handed out to you
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
before uh one of the concerns is that um
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
the body on the other side of the wall
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
still feels like this piece of
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
legislation is a little bit too
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
expensive at 55.9 million and uh we want
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
to make it as palatable to them as we
 
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
can so that we can get something done um
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
and so if you look at the amendment that
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
I handed out to you early earlier the
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
red uh the one that I said you yeah the
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
one that I just gave you the one that
 
00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:44.839 align:start position:0%
you said I'm not going to need it I said
 
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
no you are going to need it now is when
 
00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
you need
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
it there's there should be red writing
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
on it Peter as well oh yeah you got it
 
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.470 align:start position:0%
on it Peter as well oh yeah you got it
no

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
um so the nature of this bill is that
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
for the first 10 years of credible
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
Service uh depending on when you started
 
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
your um employment um you'll get 2% to
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
2.4% um of a multiplier towards your
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
final average compensation um this adds
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a caveat to it that says
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
but only for members who work up to
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
their full age age and service
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
requirements and retire under service
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
retirement if a member retires prior to
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
reaching full age and service
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
requirements their annuity multiplier
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
Remains the Same as their first 10 years
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
of credible service which for new hires
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
would be 2% and then if you look at the
 
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
chart in the bill it will show you what
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
it is for the other members depending on
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
how long they've been in service um
 
00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:52.039 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
2012 um so I'll start um I had a couple
 
00:17:58.149 --> 00:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
of questions on this uh Marty first of
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
all from a an Actuarial perspect you
 
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.830 align:start position:0%
all from a an Actuarial perspect you
know

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
perspective this would this would create
 
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
two potential future benefits right
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
because we don't know when a person if a
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
person will reach maximum retirement age
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
so they could be building a benefit of
 
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
2.5% after the first 10 years or they
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
may be at
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
2% um any idea if that's going to cause
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
major problems for the actuaries if we
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
were to go in that kind of Direction um
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
it you know what what they would do with
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
if if something like this were to pass
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
is you know continue to closely monitor
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
the retirement patterns and in future
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
experience studies which are done every
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
four years to look at all the the
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
assumptions make adjustments going
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
forward as needed if you know depending
 
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
on on um you know what what the patterns
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
are so it it you know it adds another
 
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
layer of complication but it it's
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
manageable I mean from a programming
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
perspective it I think you know we have
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
to pull our hair out what's left of it
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
at the retirement Sy to figure out how
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
to do it but um you know that that's but
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's inside that doesn't matter
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
for policy but I you know the actuary
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
will you know when when any benefit
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
Provisions are changed um you know they
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
would look at experience going forward
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
and seeing how that's affected it and
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
and you know sort of keep fine-tuning as
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
needed every every four years okay
 
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.430 align:start position:0%
needed every every four years okay
um

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
also unless I'm mistaken
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
um this would potentially have uh an
 
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
impact on people who end up on
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
disability correct because we don't have
 
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
a carve out for that so if they don't do
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
their full service
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
requirements um but not of their own
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
poition um that would have an impact on
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
them wouldn't it correct this this
 
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
amendment only speaks to service
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
retirement this is this is sort of
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
analagous to the $500 TSA Bill 1307 in
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
terms of should should those folks be
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
included because they couldn't you know
 
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
make it to full retirement age or or
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
whatever years of service type of thing
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
do we I mean we we won't have any way of
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
knowing the number of those people
 
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
obviously moving forward because they
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
haven't become dis disabled yet do we
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
know about how many people this would
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
affect in that interm
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
group um hard to say I mean the the just
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
just in terms of actual people who are
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
retired now the the um both job related
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
and non job related I think the um the
 
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
percentage in group two is um you under
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
10% for both you know so you know and
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know that's you know whether those
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
are folks who've been were disabled 30
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
years ago or you know last year I don't
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
have but you know so so it so the
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
percentage of group two disability
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
retirement is less than 10% of the total
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
group to a retire population right now
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay less than
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
10 okay any um if every is everybody
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
keeping up here or questions from the
 
00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
committee or comments I
 
00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:14.430 align:start position:0%
committee or comments I
app

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
app
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
Peter thank you I think we have to have
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
some idea of what kind of numbers we're
 
00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
talking about if people are going to be
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
involved in this
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
right if it was a under 10% of the
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
people that that sounds like it's
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
probably going to be
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
manageable uh if it were let's say 25%
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
you're going like oh that's not going to
 
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.789 align:start position:0%
you're going like oh that's not going to
work

00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
so yeah representative Gard thank you
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
maybe I missed something which I did
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
show up a little late but this the
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
amendment says 55 million 900 right or
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's the cost of the original
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill or the um estimated cost of the
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
original bill this is um this amendment
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
would seek to bring the cost down fairly
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
substantially because a member would
 
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
have to reach their full retirement
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
benefit they'd have to stay for the full
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
number of years um and and work for
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
their full but there's idea at what that
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
number would be yet well it because it
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
affects people going forward it's kind
 
00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:12.919 align:start position:0%
of impossible to know because we don't
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
know what choices people are going to
 
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
make in the future um but as far as
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
looking backwards I think we have an
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
idea for that group between 2001 2012 um
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
we would know who it would affect and
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
who it wouldn't because or for the most
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
part U maybe not totally but
 
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
in part anyway who it would affect just
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
just as clarification on on an actual
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
cost calculation to um the the the
 
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
statutory procedure would be if if this
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
amendment or any Amendment came out of
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
Edna and was adopted by the Full House
 
00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
it would obviously go to finance next
 
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
LBA would reach out to us after it
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
passes the full body to redo the fiscal
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
note for for finance and same thing if
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
Finance amended it again we and it
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
passed the house we do a new bill for
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
Senate so so we don't can't get you the
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
numbers in here but if the concept goes
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
forward from this policy committee and
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
the the Full House adopts it you know we
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's the next step and when we would
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
be able to Value this um it would
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
somewhat reduce the cost but again I
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't give you a percentage or an
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
order of magnitude because there's a lot
 
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
of moving Parts there there were a
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
couple of proposals with the retirement
 
00:23:28.269 --> 00:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
benefit Commission in the fall that
 
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
started out um adjusting the multiplier
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
in different ways and only for for tier
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
B and and the commission also asked us
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
to come back and say how much less would
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
that be if it only included people who
 
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
went under service retirements you know
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
similar language to here for those
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
proposals and these aren't apples to
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
Apple so I'm I'm only giving this as a
 
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
you know as a potential range order of
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
magnitude and it may actually be larger
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
but that reduced those proposals by um
 
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.950 align:start position:0%
but that reduced those proposals by um
somewhere

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.789 align:start position:0%
somewhere
between

00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
um uh six six and 12% on the UN of the
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
reduce the rates by between six to 12%
 
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
which reduce the unfunded for those
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
bills um 3.6 and between 3.6 and 6.7
 
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:22.039 align:start position:0%
million again dealt with the multiplier
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
but it was tib only there's other moving
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
Parts this includes tier C this includes
 
00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:30.039 align:start position:0%
a future normal cost for TRC um you know
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
but just just you know I I I can say it
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
will reduce the cost
 
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.470 align:start position:0%
will reduce the cost
somewhat

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
right yes yeah it's part of the
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
challenge of of that's I'm not going to
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
be as concerned about the monetary
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
component of it because that'll be up to
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
finance I think it's probably good if we
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
discuss the um the policy components of
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
it at the very least here and decide
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's best to hold off on
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
something like this until it gets to
 
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
finance um assuming that in its current
 
00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:03.559 align:start position:0%
state it would get through the house
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
safely the first time through um and let
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
Finance figure out if it's although if
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
we don't do this here Finance won't be
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
able to get those numbers correct if we
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
came out of finance and and you know
 
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
passed the house on on the second pass
 
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:22.919 align:start position:0%
to crossover we' crunch them during
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
crossover so the Senate would have them
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
in time to vote on it and finance could
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
always remove this if they wanted to
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
descend it back to the house floor in
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
its original form I guess so all right
 
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799 align:start position:0%
so I guess we will look at it a little
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
bit more closely um as far as the impact
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
on um group two members who are on
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
disability um is there anybody in the
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
room who wanted to speak to that is
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:26:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
R

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Brian will uh
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
president of the professional
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
firefighters of New Hampshire um as Mr
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
Carlin mentioned this was a concept that
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
we discussed in the retirement
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
commission um to add in some sort of
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
guard rails that would not only help to
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
lower the cost somewhat um but would
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
also be somewhat of a uh a dangled
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
carrot so to speak for our retention
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
issue in the state
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh to encourage people to stay longer in
 
00:26:32.669 --> 00:26:32.679 align:start position:0%
years of service um I think it's a
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
concept that was uh pretty uh well liked
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
in the commission um so I uh would be
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
supportive of this amendment um that you
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
have put out this morning um and I would
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
also agree in that carve out for the
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
disabled folks um because essentially
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
what that would do would be to not
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
penalize them um for their disability uh
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
and it would only um you know impact
 
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
those that chose to leave the fire
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
service uh on their own bition so I
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
would be supportive okay once again it
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful to know what the
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact is one way or the other we
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
don't um I just think from a policy
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
perspective it doesn't
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
seem doesn't seem right
 
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
to change somebody's potential benefit
 
00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
because they get injured it seems like
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
it would be contrary to the purpose of
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
the disability Provisions but uh
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
anything from any of the committee
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
members I think I'd like to have some
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
kind of a feeling for what the what the
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
numbers would do I
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
mean even if we're I I I think I feel
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
much more comfortable if we would at
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
least strategize or game out what it
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
would be what with some idea of the
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
numbers if we're just saying
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
well well so I think I I think when it
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
comes to this particular am Amendment as
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
Mr R just pointed out um there's two
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
things to keep in in mind one is by
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
requiring a member to reach their full
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit to get the maximum
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
multiplier it's a retention carrot so
 
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
from that perspective we're just talking
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
about it as a retention you know carrot
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
will they stay longer will they stay
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
till full retirement so that they get
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
potenti I mean for new hires it' be a
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
half a percent added to their multiplier
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
which is a substantial difference to
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
their retirement benefit um so it is a
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
pretty decent sized carrot you know um
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
to keep them I guess it wouldn't be a
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
full half per it would be somewhere
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
between 2%
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
and probably four point something
 
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
percent but
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
um so from that perspective as far as
 
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
the cost the overall cost is we there's
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
no way to know like we can't that's what
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
the actuaries do and like it's a
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
complicated process and they won't do it
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
until it goes to finance so the whole
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
house will hear back on it will you know
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
finance will discuss the financial
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
impacts of it and then bring it back to
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
the house so we'll be able to listen to
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
their thoughts on it and vote at that
 
00:29:07.389 --> 00:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
point but they won't run numbers for US
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
unless we've passed the house I'm I'm
 
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair yes if I may um thank you
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative for your concerns I I
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
would have those same concerns um I
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
think what's important to know I know Mr
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
Carlin uh touched on this as well when
 
00:29:28.509 --> 00:29:28.519 align:start position:0%
we discussed this in the commission it
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
was on one of Senator Bradley's proposed
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
amendments and uh when we brought it
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
Forward uh correct me if I'm wrong but I
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
believe it lowered the cost
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
approximately $7
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
million um and that bill at the time
 
00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
that we were discussing was only a bill
 
00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.039 align:start position:0%
that would impact the tier B the middle
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
tier sliding scale group um this is a
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
bill that impacts not only that group
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
but the group that came after the TRC
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
folks so um you know if that was a
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
reduction of $7 million my assumption
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
would be uh that this with the added
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
folks added into this would be no less
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
than a$7 million reduction as well um
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
and the conversations that were had in
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
the commission were that uh this 55
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
million needed to come down 5 to 10
 
00:30:24.029 --> 00:30:24.039 align:start position:0%
million in order for it to be palatable
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
in the Senate um which is where we're we
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
think this will put us right in that
 
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
range I think we have to at least Peter
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
like I I think we have to at least think
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
about it be be aware of it you know we
 
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to flesh it out
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
completely but we should at
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
least give it a moment's thought because
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're flying completely blind
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that's wise even if it's
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
not determinative we ought to at least
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
say okay on the one hand this on the
 
00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
other hand that and so
 
00:31:02.669 --> 00:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
forth well I think that yeah I mean I
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
think at the very least we know that the
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
bill as written is
 
00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:08.110 align:start position:0%
bill as written is
55.6

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
55.6
 
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.430 align:start position:0%
55.6
million

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
um I think at the very least we know
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
that making this move is potentially
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
necessary for the bill to have any shot
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
um at least according to communication
 
00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:23.799 align:start position:0%
that we've had that's exactly the point
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
I Mak yeah and so if if we know this if
 
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate won't even consider it then
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
we can't go that way if we want to get
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
anything done right so this would be
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
this would be a potential um Avenue for
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
that um we won't be able to vote on this
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill today anyway because I'm going to
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
have to go have an official amendment
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
made and we'll have to talk about that
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
make sure it's all polished up and
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
everybody's happy with it before it
 
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
moves out of the subcommittee anyway so
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
we won't be voting on that today just
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
kind of laying the groundwork so we can
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
go and and write one up to be disc
 
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
discussed at a future date um does
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any comments yep um
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
R thank you Mr chairman um members of

1647 as introduced which which uh page
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
of that bill though um it's the first
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
page the first page okay yeah where it
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
it indicates uh or a group two member in
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
service who has attained age 60
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of the numbers of years of
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
service May retire in a service
 
00:32:56.519 --> 00:32:57.549 align:start position:0%
service May retire in a service
retirement

00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
is the amendment I don't see that in the
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
amendment unless I'm missing it does
 
00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
that affect somebody that were to be
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
employed in group two say at 40 years
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
old and at 60 they retired with 20 years
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
of service they wouldn't have um the
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
years and age as
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
indicated um for regular retirement but
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
at age 60 you can retire um regardless
 
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
of the age and uh regardless of a age
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
and years of service if you obtain 60
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
yeah there's no change same they have
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
the same what page are you looking at
 
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
because I don't have it on this on the
 
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that's Line
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
original the yeah they're not numbered
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
in the amendment but we didn't change
 
00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:45.559 align:start position:0%
that portion there okay propos so
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
somebody that were to work start work at
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
age 40 at when they reach age 60 would
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
they would they get their two and a
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
half% for the years after 10 years Mr
 
00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:58.990 align:start position:0%
half% for the years after 10 years Mr
cin

00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
yes um that's how it's
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
applied that's how it's applied now so I
 
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
I would throw the question back to our
 
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
lawyers just to make sure but that on
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
its face that's how we would continue to
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
interpret it because it doesn't change
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
that wording at all right and and it it
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
is still a service retirement so
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
actually without getting the legal
 
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
blessing I mean it it's a service
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
retirement there there are two in group
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
one you know there's an age to be
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
eligible for Service retirement in group
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
two there's two ways for service
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
retirement meeting the minimum age and
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
minimum service which is way most people
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
go or a minimum age so that's still a
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
service retirement so that that
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
shouldn't change that for that person
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
who comes to New Hampshire in their 40s
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
and works 15 or 20 years because it's
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
still a service retirement right thank
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:58.510 align:start position:0%
 
pearon

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
pearon
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
think I just want to touch
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
on a potential if I can maybe help your
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
representative SMI just a little bit the
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers that were
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
crunched in the subcommittee that Mr
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
real talked about it with the with that
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
the middle tier guys right that's a
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
population that exists right now of it's
 
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
what is the number it's dropped it's
 
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
164 166 16 1642 1,600 A5 people roughly
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
right okay the population of tier C
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
after that is three times that size
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
potentially right so if you if you take
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
extrapolate a savings for this group and
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
then you looked at the group after
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
that's larger you it would be fair to
 
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
reason that that the adjustment would be
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
that would be larger as well so the
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
target I think is what he's getting at
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
is the Target that they're trying to get
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
at here is obtainable or at least
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
appears to be obtainable based on what
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
happened during the
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
commission and the various things that
 
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
they they played with back and forth
 
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
because the retirement system provided a
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
lot of theoretical stuff and there were
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of proposals that that were thrown
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
out that didn't happen but there was
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
numbers with those and they were josling
 
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
back and forth is to a way to come up
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
with something that worked based on that
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
so you know when when you're looking at
 
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
a finite group of folks and then you
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
look at what comes after being a larger
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
group you know what I mean I think that
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
we can get to the theoretical on that
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
without having to get too overly hung up
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
on exact numbers which which finance
 
00:36:46.309 --> 00:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
will get right so in a PO as a policy
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee that Edna is I guess the the
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
real focus is does this idea work and
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
then Finance can tweak the what you know
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
what the retirement system will provide
 
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
them after but the logic I think is
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
there for for the goal okay does that
 
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
make sense to you y yeah I don't think
 
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.430 align:start position:0%
make sense to you y yeah I don't think
we

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
should I don't think we should dive off
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
the diving board until we at least look
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
to see if there any any water in the
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
pool uh and so we talked through and we
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
have some idea we we understand that
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
this is not going to be fine-tuned we
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
need the exact numbers for that but at
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
least we talked about the general
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
concept okay with it and like I said I I
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
think that if the theor if the
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
theoretical on that didn't work we would
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
I I would certainly be going hey whoa
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
time out right but it it it does here so
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know I I don't think sending this
 
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
over to finance is going to come back in
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
with some sort of like holy cow holy cow
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
number right I I I just don't see it
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just the way that the I
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
mean the retirement system has been
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
functioning now for a long time time and
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
the patterns that that happen start to
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
become fairly predictable in certain
 
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
ways so this is this concept's not we're
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
not in inventing A New Concept or a new
 
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
way to deal with something we're just
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
putting some guard rails on what is
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
already existing that if I if that makes
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
sense to you Peak okay so and I think
 
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
the other thing to keep in mind too is
 
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
this is a cost reduction measure it's
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
not going to be a cost increase measure
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to ask ourselves the
 
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
question what's the concern that it's
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
not going to reduce it enough or that
 
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to reduce it too much um
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
because those are kind of the two
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
options on the table it will reduce but
 
00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
is it going to hit the mark that we need
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
or is it going to go Way Beyond the mark
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
that we need and I would say I guess if
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
it went Way Beyond the mark that you
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
need then you know people might be upset
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
that they were giving up benefits for a
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
specific group of people that they could
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
have had within the price range that's
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
your risk there um but and if it's not
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
enough then it might just not be enough
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
to get it through and find will have to
 
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
look at that um when it gets there um to
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
see if there's another way to you know
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
cost save but those are really the two
 
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
options the thing is too on top of that
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
is we're talking
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
about numbers here that frankly are
 
00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
absorbable okay within not not only
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
within the realm of the Surplus but in
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
the you know in my conversations with
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
the speaker there's two other pots of
 
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
money that exist where that could that
 
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
he is willing to use to make this work
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
so we're you know we're not talking
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
about you know the G the addition of $50
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
million or the reduction of it the
 
00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
numbers aren't that huge it's it would
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
be little bits and pieces where you know
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
if if someone's Line in the Sand is $48
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
million and this is 48.5 are we really
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
going to kill it when when we have some
 
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
wiggle room really to to make things
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
work yeah there's there's definitely
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
wiggle room to make things work I would
 
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
agree with that so we've had this
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
discussion because the alternative is we
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the discussion and then we it
 
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
comes before the other group and
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
suddenly we say oh we never talked about
 
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
that well we have talked about well as
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
well too as as as you're well aware I
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
mean subcommittees bring forward to the
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
full committee so you have
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
to not necessarily sell it but you have
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
to be able to present it right and and
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
show that you thoroughly vetted what you
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
were looking at and I think that that's
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you doing that so
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else want to speak to 1647
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
today I'm still not clear with that
 
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
language that's fine I mean it's going
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
to have to go into Amendment anyway um
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
so it's it's going to come
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
back yes Mr Carlin I just thought a one
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
other point to make it's not a you know
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%
a deal breaker but I think it's a good a
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
good fact for the the subcommittee to
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
consider so any reductions as a result
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
of this amendment would be on the
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability point portion the the
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
way the bill was constructed is
 
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
introduced the 55 million is expected to
 
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
cover the unfunded piece for you know
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
the tier B andc members affected
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
basically any um so the normal cost
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
would be the same so that rate increase
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
of 094 and 95 you know wouldn't be
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
affected by this this is only on what
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
the appropriation for the unfunded that
 
00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
the state would be putting forward I I
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
think some of you may have been aware of
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
that already and with unfunded ability
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
just if you think about it the closer
 
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
someone is to retirement you know the
 
00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
more unfunded is with them it's almost
 
00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
like a slope you know what I mean if
 
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
somebody started yesterday they don't
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
really have any or today they don't have
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
any liability associated with them and
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
we don't calculate it on a per member
 
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
basis because that wouldn't be you know
 
00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be fair you know they they
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
calculate it as an aggregate number but
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
if the the liability another way to put
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
it is the LI the unfunded liability for
 
00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
any of these bills on tier B is more
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
than on tier C because they have been
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
here less time and they're going to have
 
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
to work longer to get out you know type
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
of thing so that just just sort of to to
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
help frame the thing so so you not
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
saying you this this will reduce the
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability by some amount and
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
you know if if it if it was you know
 
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
approved we'll be able to tell you
 
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
reasonably how much um you know so so it
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
is definitely going to cut the cost but
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
it's it's all on the unfunded piece so
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
that's the piece that the commission and
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
members of the commission wanted the
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
state to front in this case so it
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be passed on in rates to the to
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
the municipalities and schools right um
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
just clarification on that though with
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
the potential amendment that we've been
 
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
discussing with the potential reduction
 
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
of the rate if they don't reach their
 
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
full retirement service um that would
 
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
have elements that would be a reduction
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
to the um municipalities and
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
would it not because we wouldn't have to
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
charge them as much in the future I
 
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
understand what you were saying actually
 
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
the the the the this amendment or you
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
know wouldn't change what the projected
 
00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:10.559 align:start position:0%
future employer costs are because it's
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
it would be reducing the unfunded
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
portion that the state was you know
 
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
paying you know you know on delivery if
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
you will you know so it it you know it
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
it will reduce the state appropriation
 
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
by by some amount but the FY 26 2728
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
costs of the change would be the same
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
okay gotcha you know well you know it'll
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
be the same there might be some changes
 
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
for patterns in the future as as if not
 
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
everybody in TRC there's a percentage of
 
00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
people who drop out before they meet
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
their age I shouldn't say that
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
completely but that's not going to show
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
up for you know a few Cycles right yeah
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
1647 okay I see no more conversation
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Colin I think we're all set
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
um I would like to
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
1653 uh modifying the definition of an
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation for group two um
 
00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
and I would like to move interim study
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
on that just curious if I have a second
 
00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:20.150 align:start position:0%
on that just curious if I have a second
on

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
that second from representative Gard
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
you um I would just say um we discussed
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
it earlier in the day and everybody
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
seemed like they were pretty amenable to
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
it everybody out there seemed amenable
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
to it um it leaves us with some wiggle
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
room some some way to work with uh bill
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
to work with if something happens to
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
1647 and um does anybody else want to
 
00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.470 align:start position:0%
1647 and um does anybody else want to
make

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%

regarding how identifiable information

contained within a vital record is
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
collected and reported to other state
 
01:02:38.829 --> 01:02:38.839 align:start position:0%
agencies I'm the former state New

Hampshire um registar and was the
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
director of the division of Vital
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
Records Administration under the
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State in 2005 the
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
legislature made a policy decision to
 
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
move the division of Vital Records from
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human

Hampshire City and town uh clerks
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
Association we pursued this legislation
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
because there was a shared concern with
 
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
how the very personal information that
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
is collected during the birth and death
 
01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
event registration was being
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
shared when a mother gives birth in a
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
hospital she is asked to provide
 
01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
information that includes both
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
demographic like Social Security uh
 
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
number full name of child father and
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
mother address and whether she was
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
married or not and also personal
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
information like alcohol use during
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
pregnancy smoking before and during
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
pregnancy there used to be a threat of a
 
01:03:33.789 --> 01:03:33.799 align:start position:0%
class B felony on the worksheet if the
 
01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
mother refused to provide all that
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
information on the form thanks to the
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
legislation brought forward by Senator
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
rosenal last session the threat of
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
clasby felony was
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
removed but in reality it doesn't matter
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
if the mother refuses to provide it
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
private information or not because the
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
hospital retrieves that information from
 
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
their medical records and shares that
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
information with Vital
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
transmitted to Vital Records now
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
includes all her recovered demographic
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
data and additional items such as if the
 
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
mother had gonorrhea syphus cyia during
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy as well as the total
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
abortions there is no informed consent
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
offered to the birth mother to stop this
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
she has no opportunity to stop her
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
personal data from going to many
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%

dhh DHHS are extremely important and
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
they do great work furthermore DHHS puts
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
safeguards on staff that access this
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
data but having this data go to many
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
staff in many programs uh increases the
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
possibility of misuse and causes the
 
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
complete loss of privacy of our
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
citizens privacy has always been a
 
01:05:44.349 --> 01:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
concern and this legislature has
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
recently supported two bills that ensure
 
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
privacy during January 3D's house
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
session SB 255 relative to the
 
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy pass pass the
 
01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
house on a Voice vote and allows New
 
01:05:58.829 --> 01:05:58.839 align:start position:0%

01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
out of large companies use of their

01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
relative to the expectation of privacy
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
in the collection and use of personal
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%

01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
during the January 3rd house house
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
hearing this bill determined that
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
service providers covered by hb3 314
 
01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
hold some of our more sensitive personal
 
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
information and they must obtain
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
permission from any individual before
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
the company can use it privacy rights
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
have quite a history in Hampshire while
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
serving in the State House honorable
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
Neil Kirk was a fire brand in his
 
01:06:39.269 --> 01:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
respect and pursuit of safeguards on New
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens privacy
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk drafted a con
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment enshrining
 
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
privacy into the New Hampshire
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
Constitution which read an individual's
 
01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
right to live free from government
 
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
intrusion and private or personal
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
information is natural essential and
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
inherent the amendment was put to a
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
general vote and became part of the New
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constitution in November of
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
2018 with res with respect for the good
 
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:11.079 align:start position:0%
work that representative Kirk did as a
 
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
legislator this act should correct the
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
current practice of sharing very private
 
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
vital record data with other state
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
agencies despite the fact that none of
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
the mothers who gave birth had given
 
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
their permission to share her their most
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
private information so I urge that Edna
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
committee support HB 1689 to correct
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
this unfortunate breach of privacy thank
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you are there questions from
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
black uh thank you I've got a couple
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
questions one is um you know limiting
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
the access of information on Nal with
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
the uh for nality so for someone being
 
01:07:57.309 --> 01:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
born you know I completely support I was
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
actually a co-sponsor on Senator Rosen
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
wal's uh bill um but I have some concern
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
about uh mortality because um I think
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
there's a more general interest in
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
understanding why somebody's died
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
because that can have an effect on
 
01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
everybody you know there's been some
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
recent experience with issues around
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
that um so that's one question the other
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
one is have you looked at uh Senator
 
01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald has another bill in it B 484
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
this year related to the birth worksheet
 
01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering if you'd looked at
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
that and if you see any interaction
 
01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:33.400 align:start position:0%
between that and what you're proposing
 
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
here um regarding that the bill I I'm uh
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
I signed off on that bill so I'm also in
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
support of Senator Rosen Wall's new bill
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
see I I looked at it looked so followup
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
sorry followup so um I look it looked
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
like it would interact okay with this
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
but I was just wondering if you looked
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
at it yes thank you on that one and she
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
indicated that she was support of this
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
bill as well so regarding death
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
information yeah so um death information
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know at least the the um the event
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
and the death are public the identifier
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
such as names and you know anything that
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
would identify the decedent is not and
 
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
we've always shared generally the death
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
information in fact it's still um
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
available online um through an
 
01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
application that we developed when I was
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
the registar called NE never in web and
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
you can go in in query um all of the the
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
death records um for specific icd10
 
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
codes or um and you can basically see
 
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
all that information online but the the
 
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
identifiers are not they're not open to
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
anyone without a direct and tangible
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
interest in that record brief follow
 
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
yeah um so as I understand what you just
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
said that right now the personal
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
identifier information is not available
 
01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
to the public and if that's the case
 
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
then what would this change so what um
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
the public is different than the
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
um what um it basically they get all the
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
Death information as well including
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
identifiers and as I indicated that just
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
by sharing um that that data with far
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
well the the vision of V record is
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
actually a very small department and
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
also they're imbued with the the need
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
for privacy and they so there's only
 
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
like um maybe four four or five staff
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
that actually have access to the data
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
but when it goes over the DHHS you have
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps like 15 program areas that have
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
staff that look at it so my um concern
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
is that there's more of a chance of of
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
vulnerability and release and misuse of
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
that data so we've increased that that
 
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.390 align:start position:0%
that data so we've increased that that
possibility

01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
right thank you you're welcome represent
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
Ro thank you representative Bolton how
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
is this bill different from s SP
 
01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
105 which was the bill last year that we
 
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
amended because there were significant
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
issues with that there was um I just
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
might I recall that that Bill had um
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
additional um removal of certain fields
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
and such um and actually I think that
 
01:11:24.669 --> 01:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
that bill um
 
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
had the ability to break the connection
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
between um Vital Records um providing
 
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
information to uh that's not it oh yes
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
it did have a that's
 
01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
right it didn't allow because of the as
 
01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
a result of s SP 105 information
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
important for Vital Records such as
 
01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
birth certificates were not going to be
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
issued I didn't quite uh understand that
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
from the bill I thought I was more
 
01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
concerned on the fact that also too
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of like data sharing
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
between contractual data sharing between
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
vital records and the national Center
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
for Health statistics and Social
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
Security Administration for death and
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
birth rep representative both the main
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
point of that bill when it first came to
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
us was to eliminate most of the data
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
Gathering and and so that the the useful
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
data that you need for birth certificate
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
like the child's name and the parents
 
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
name was not included so the was not
 
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
sent to Vital Records this bill doesn't
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
appear to limit what information is
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
gathered just what mostly what vital
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
records does with it that's correct and
 
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
I didn't sign off on the um the last
 
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
bill from last session what I did
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
totally disagree with uh was the
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
appearance of a class B felony on the
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
forms that collect CED the data and that
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
has since been removed but that data is
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
still being provided to uh M vital Ral
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know vital records and through that
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
Health ins Human Services follow up
 
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you and the contractual
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
agreement between vital records in the
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
is still honored correct yep actually we
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
have a state regist current state regist
 
01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
here that would probably answer that
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
better too yes thank you okay any other
 
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.390 align:start position:0%
better too yes thank you okay any other
questions

catch it it's never in web it's nhv r i
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
n web NH v r i r web thank you and the
 
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
current state res can determine whether
 
01:13:42.189 --> 01:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
or not I think it I believe it's still
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
very active and your ability to query um
 
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
death you know birth and I think fetal
 
01:13:50.189 --> 01:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
death as well okay thank you marriage

01:14:16.629 --> 01:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
Representatives my name is uh Jerry
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%

summersworth and Rollinsford
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
I'm primarily concerned about identi
 
01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.790 align:start position:0%
I'm primarily concerned about identi
identity

01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
identity
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
um just to give you a little background
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
I'm was a computer professional for 31
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
years uh involved with introducing
 
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
electronic mail products to the N to the
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
world um and very complex networks and
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
we what we thought were highly secure
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.390 align:start position:0%
 
weren't

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
weren't
 
01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.350 align:start position:0%
weren't
I'm

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:14:58.990 --> 01:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
concerned that the hacker
 
01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:01.719 align:start position:0%
industry is progressing with their own
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
software on a regular basis they get
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
updates to hack networks and systems and
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
when you can't get into one system they
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
update their software to get into
 
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
another I was a victim of identity theft
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
my credit card information my name my
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
address was stolen and I had to go in
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
and change all of all of the the credit
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
cards I
 
01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
had U I know other people have
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
experienced it and it's a very high
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
incidence of that and we hear daily that
 
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
there are other networks even in
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
government agencies where those their
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
information I'm also concerned as we as
 
01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
information is shared and I know that or
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
I I would hope that our networks are
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
highly secure is that we also have the
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
human factor of how that information is
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
handled and what might be left on a
 
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
desktop that somebody else could find so
 
01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
it does concern me it's multiple points
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
information so I am concerned about
 
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
those multiple points of of access as
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
shared I know as far as the birth
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
information it seems to be that that
 
01:16:24.629 --> 01:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
that information has felt held very
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
tight but I'm concerned also about death
 
01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.229 align:start position:0%
tight but I'm concerned also about death
record

01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
information we've seen problems with
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
voting and information about individuals
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
and their address information being used
 
01:16:38.159 --> 01:16:40.189 align:start position:0%
and their address information being used
to

01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
spoof the uh their their pole booths to
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
get in and I'm concerned that
 
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
information that is available especially
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
for death records could be used um for
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
reasons and I and I'm also acutely aware
 
01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
that during a death that it the family
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
should be in control of whatever
 
01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
information is released for public use
 
01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
and I've seen as far as death
 
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
announcements is not a whole lot of
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
information about location is being
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
included on a lot of those records
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
now and thank you for listening to me
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions you might
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
have thank you are there any questions
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
committee no thank you some very good

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
you should turn the mic on it' be it

I'm Christen kenniston I am the current
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
register of Vital Records and I am here
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
to obviously talk about this bill um
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
just so you know we're not coming in
 
01:18:12.189 --> 01:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
with a stance to um oppose or support I
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out some things
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
that I noticed within the bill that I
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
should make you aware of from aital
 
01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:18.430 align:start position:0%
should make you aware of from aital
records

01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
records
 
01:18:21.149 --> 01:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
standpoint um so I will start off by
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
saying that we don't have any concerns
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
about adding the term and definition of
 
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
personal identifiers to RSA 5 C1 um but
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
there are some areas Within Chapter 5c
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
that are not being addressed within this
 
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
bill that um could create some issues we
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
need some clarity on so under RSA 5c3
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
and 5 C5 basically says that the
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State shall not remove or
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
add any data fields used for purposes of
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
protecting the public health or to
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
conduct health related research without
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
prior notice in agreement of the
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
so by eliminating the data fields um
 
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
that dvra is sharing with
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
DHHS I'm wondering if the bill would
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
contradict that statute um under rsa's 5
 
01:19:11.629 --> 01:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
C12 5c 101
 
01:19:15.629 --> 01:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
5c3 excuse me 5c 103 um talks about
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
tangible interest so as um
 
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
representative Bolton mentioned and you
 
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
need tangible interest to obtain a
 
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
record we're not an open record State
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
you actually have to have um a relation
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
or some sort of a legal purpose to
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
obtain information so right now with the
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
way the statutes are the Department of
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services does have a
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
direct and tangible interest our our um
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
agencies are linked in the sense that
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
they would need to access our data for
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
child support services um things of that
 
01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
nature so there have been times where
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
when they go to court for whatever
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
reason we've issued certified copies of
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
Vital Records to them for that purpose
 
01:19:56.629 --> 01:19:56.639 align:start position:0%
so I just need to know would we still be
 
01:19:58.510 --> 01:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
permitted to do that or what kind of
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
restriction would this bill place on our
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
ability to issue certified and not just
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
to that agency other agencies that might
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
reach out to us looking for certified
 
01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
copies so I would just need
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
clarification um the bill restricts the
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
sharing of Vital Records and statistical
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
data to the Department of Health and
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
Human Services solely to mortality and
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
natality statistics it further mandates
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
three removal of personal identifiers
 
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
before sharing rsa's 5c4 and 5 C9
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
establish memorandums of understanding
 
01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
between the Department of State and the
 
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections and the
 
01:20:39.629 --> 01:20:39.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system in which
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
limited personal identifying information
 
01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
is shared RSA 5c4 also requires the
 
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
intradepartmental sharing of personal
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
identifying information between the
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records and our
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
election division to assist in
 
01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
maintaining the accuracy of the voter
 
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
database so both of those divisions are
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
part of the Department of State and what
 
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to is um death information
 
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
is provided in a way that it can match
 
01:21:06.669 --> 01:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
up within their system and automatically
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
flag a voter in real time that this
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
person is deceased which allows clerks
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
to then update their checklists and
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
remove that deceased
 
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
voter um currently divorce and marriage
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
records which do not contain health
 
01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
statistics but do contain personal
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
identifiers are being shared with DHHS
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
under our existing mou the bill would
 
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
discontinue the sharing of the divorce
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
and marriage information with them um
 
01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
because there's no health statistics to
 
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
associate with the personal identifiers
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
in the deaths and marriage one can
 
01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
reasonably assume that the linkage
 
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
between the health statistics and the
 
01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
personal identifiers is not the main
 
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
concern of this bill um it's solely for
 
01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
limiting the release of personal
 
01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
identifying information so that
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
naturally raises the question as to
 
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
whether the Department of State will
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
still be permitted to continue sharing
 
01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
personal identifying information from
 
01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
vital records with the Department of
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
Corrections New Hampshire retirement
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
system and if we can continue our
 
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
intrapersonal our intad departmental
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
sharing of data to keep our voter
 
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
checklist um current the proposed change
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
to RSA 126 24d is contradictory to other
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
statutes that Define the memorandum of
 
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:17.639 align:start position:0%
understanding between the commissioner
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Health and Human
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
Services and the Department of State the
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
change would seemingly have the
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and myself who are
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
part of the same unit enter into an
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
agreement with one another as opposed to
 
01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
us having an agreement with um DHHS but
 
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
it's under a DHHS statute that's giving
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
us that link so I see a little bit of an
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
issue that we would need that clarified
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
so that we have the right guidance um
 
01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
and furthermore if the division of Vital
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
Records is to assume dhs's current role
 
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
in releasing approved vital records
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
information for health related research
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
more work would need to be done in
 
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
chapters when 126 which is public health
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
and is in charge of the vital records
 
01:22:58.590 --> 01:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
privacy board and then also to chapter
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
5c as I've pointed out um areas would
 
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.350 align:start position:0%
5c as I've pointed out um areas would
need

01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
clarification the bill doesn't
 
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate any funding to the Secretary
 
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
of State's office and there will be some
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
fi uh fiscal impacts so when we first
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
learned of the bill we anticipated an
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
impact of under $10,000 um just by
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
simply limiting the data exchange
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
between us and between DHHS but not
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
knowing exactly where this is going to
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
go how it's going to affect other
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
memorandums of understanding and also um
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
us taking on the role of the Department
 
01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services releasing
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
information for the health related
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
research I don't know what kind of a
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact that would have I can say
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
that we would need more staff um I would
 
01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
end up having to defer to Health and
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
Human Services for some guidance on how
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
many staff they currently have in this
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
role but I'm anticipating at least a
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
dozen um so just to put that out there
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
and if I need more staff um I would
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
actually need a larger space to house
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
them our building that we're in is
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
deceptively larg looking because the
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
bulk of it's the warehouse so um and we
 
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
share with archives and our elections
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
division so um I just want to keep that
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
in mind that if we do this that we're
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
going to have some big changes not just
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
with how we're doing things but where
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing things so that is all I have
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
today to offer you if you have any
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
questions for me representative laus
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um I couldn't get all that
 
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
written down as you're going through I'm
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could list the specific
 
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:28.639 align:start position:0%
concerns rsas related and all that and
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
send it to the committee yes and at
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
least give the committee in the option
 
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
of considering maybe some exceptions if
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
that we go that path yes I can do that
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay other questions uh
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it would need to yes it's
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
going to um I think this is
 
01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:50.030 align:start position:0%
going to um I think this is
representative

01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
grotus I served on the vital record
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
record privacy board
 
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
for I don't know five or six years
 
01:24:59.550 --> 01:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
anyway I think several terms I'm now on
 
01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
the vital records Improvement um
 
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
committee verifact we call
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
it and so I'm very concerned about this
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
issue and I I would appreciate it going
 
01:25:13.629 --> 01:25:13.639 align:start position:0%
to subcommittee would you be available
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
for that Madame registrar yes thank you
 
01:25:19.229 --> 01:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you repres man py thank you
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
question since when it's totally digital
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
you probably have the archive of
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
physical files some some okay yes so
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
what is the year it was completely
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
transitioned okay so it was in stages
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
but births um was around I believe it
 
01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
was 2002 I think we have paper copies up
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
to 2001 of all birth records and when I
 
01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
say paper copies of birth records as a
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
reminder for those of you who were here
 
01:25:54.189 --> 01:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
during SB 105 we don't have the birth
 
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
worksheets with all that information on
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
it I just have a simple certificate
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
onepage document per per person born um
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
death records we are still trying to
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
transition to electronic but it is a
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
hybrid right now of electronic and paper
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
marriage is also a hybrid of electronic
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
and paper it's all keyed in
 
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
electronically with a city clerk or town
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
clerk and then the marriage license is
 
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
issued for use and then when it comes
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
back it's filed and kept on file in the
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
paper format with the division of Vital
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
Records so we're running on a hybrid
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
system right now um most of our records
 
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
are available in electronic database
 
01:26:33.149 --> 01:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
whether they exist on paper or not uh
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
for example birth records we can go as
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
far back as
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
1935 that you could go anywhere in the
 
01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
state and get a
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
copy thank you questions representative
 
01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
gold and beyond that there are
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
electronic images from the open records
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
the early records available on family
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
service ancestry.com yes y we work hard
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
with um ancestry.com thank you for that
 
01:26:59.430 --> 01:26:59.440 align:start position:0%

Patricia

01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
Tilly good morning chair good morning
 
01:27:21.229 --> 01:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I apologize for
 
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
my froggy voice uh this morning my name
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
is Patricia Tilly I am an associate
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner with the Department of
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and we are
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
here today in opposition to HB 1689
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
relative to the use of personal
 
01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:37.639 align:start position:0%
identifying information by state
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
agencies because of the breadth of the
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
impacts my written testimony is quite
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
long so I apologize in advance it is
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
quite detailed it gives a number of
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
statutory references that I know um will
 
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
be important for the committee to
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
consider um um so I will just hit the
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
high points right now we've also
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
provided hard copies of our fiscal
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
impact um we know that the OS is working
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
like crazy to get stuff attached we and
 
01:28:04.109 --> 01:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
that was not yet available to be
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
attached electronically so we've
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
provided you the hard copies hopefully
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
the electronic stuff will will catch up
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
along the way um so we do not take
 
01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill lightly but
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
without Vital Records um with its
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
personal identifiers the department will
 
01:28:24.109 --> 01:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
be unable to fulfill its core statutory
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
functions to protect and to promote the
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
health well-being and economic stability
 
01:28:33.390 --> 01:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
of all of the people in New Hampshire
 
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
Additionally the removal of this current
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
access will cost the state not only in
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
tens of millions if not more of lost
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
federal revenue but foundational complex
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
DHHS Data Systems would need to be
 
01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:49.870 align:start position:0%
DHHS Data Systems would need to be
completely

01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
redesigned because we at the the
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
department are entrusted with this
 
01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
sensitive and private data we have
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
rigorous data governance that limits
 
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
access to the information so if I I own
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
that means the people who have access
 
01:29:08.669 --> 01:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
have a tangible need for that as an
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner I can't see that
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
data as someone who works in a child
 
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
support function they can't see the
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
Health Data all of the data is strictly
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
limited to who needs it to get their job
 
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
done HB 1689 has far-reaching
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
consequences it impacts access to needed
 
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
healthc care services it impacts
 
01:29:32.669 --> 01:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
economic supports it impacts our ability
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
to detect fraud uh for New Hampshire
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
residents without access to this
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
information regard that includes an
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
individual's name their address and we
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
assume that's also their zip code in
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
their Town their spouse's name their
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
children's name there even their social
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
security number really unimaginable
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
things will happen
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
our federally qualified Health Centers
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
may lose their Federal support and be
 
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
unable to serve 880,000 low income
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
people in the state in need of health
 
01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
care families in your communities will
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
not receive the child support to which
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
they are entitled the department will
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
not be able to facilitate International
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
adoptions so that children can have a fa
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
ever home and the department will lose
 
01:30:20.109 --> 01:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
the tools they need to fight Fraud and
 
01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
Abuse the department uses this data
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
every day if the department doesn't
 
01:30:26.590 --> 01:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
provide these Services it's unclear
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
which agency or entity would or if New
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's would not be entitled to the
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
same benefits that every that citizens
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
in every other state currently have
 
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
while very well intended 1689 puts the
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
health and the economic security of our
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents at risk last
 
01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
session we heard um that this committee
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
considered s SP 105 and that was
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
relative to information collect Ed by
 
01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
vital records as part of the live birth
 
01:30:57.149 --> 01:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
worksheet we worked together on that and
 
01:30:59.229 --> 01:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
at the time the department testified it
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
a significant unintended consequences of
 
01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:02.390 align:start position:0%
a significant unintended consequences of
that

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
legislation um and you all heard
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
testimony from healthc care providers
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
Community stakeholders families and this
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously decided to remove
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
the restrictive sections of that bill
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
and pass other important privacy um
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
components that took away those uh legal
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
ramifications um but it maintained the
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
department maintain the access that it
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
needed in our testimony today you're
 
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
going to hear similar themes broadly
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
speaking um aggregate deidentified data
 
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
about births deaths and other records
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
are insufficient for the works for the
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
Department's responsibilities as RSA 5c
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
States the department has a direct and
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
tangible interest in these records and
 
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
we will not without it we will not have
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
the abil ability to respond to the
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%

department to establish parentage and

paternity which will result in children
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
losing economic supports it will take
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
away the capacity to understand unusual
 
01:32:12.270 --> 01:32:12.280 align:start position:0%
patterns in deaths as the state registar
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
noted there are many areas of the bill
 
01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
that contradict a broad range of current
 
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
statues that are on the book it doesn't
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
provide consistent definitions and more
 
01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
work would be needed to untangle that
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
spider web restricting Department access
 
01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:29.320 align:start position:0%

the committee you know believes those
 
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
risks are worth taking the whole whole
 
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
work of
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
untangling um uh the legislation or the
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
statutes throughout our statutes so a
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more on public health and
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
Healthcare um without access to Vital
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
Records more than 85,000 New Hampshire
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
residents may lose uh access to their
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Center why is
 
01:33:12.510 --> 01:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
that it's not that they couldn't do
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
their work it's that their designation
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
as a federally qualified Health Center
 
01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
depends on the vital record birth data
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can say that something is a
 
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
medically underserved area these are
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
federal constructs and without that
 
01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
designation they don't get the
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
additional money both from the federal
 
01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
CMS from federal U um US Department of
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services or CMS it
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
really undermines the entire system per
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
on a more personal note in New Hampshire
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
we use the vital records for newborn
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
screening last year you may recall we
 
01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
had a really impassioned family come and
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
talk about about what that's like for
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
them to make sure that their child has
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
access to those new newborn screening at
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
Birth and that the state can ensure that
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
services are implemented right away if
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
one of those children have a positive
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
screen for a time sensitive congenital
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
condition these are conditions where a
 
01:34:12.149 --> 01:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
baby looks healthy and gets sent could
 
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
get sent home and be just fine but in
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
reality may have a chromosomal disorder
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
that they need to change their food
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
right away or a treatment needs to begin
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
away before there is loss in cognition
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
or health function that's how we use
 
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
vital records every day um at you know
 
01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
if we talk about economic supports and
 
01:34:35.310 --> 01:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
and Human Services we look we know that
 
01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
the complete birth record allows the
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
department to verify citizenship to Aid
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
in eligibility for Public Assistance
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
programs such as tanith snap child
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
support Medicaid the proposed changes
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
would delay the process for deter
 
01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
terminations by limiting access to the
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
identifiable information to verify their
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
application without the ability to
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
confirm the name the date of birth the
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
residence the paternity the maternity
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to provide that level
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
of pro of of um verification would fall
 
01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
upon the client and failure could result
 
01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
in a denial of benefits additionally New
 
01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents seeking things like
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
International adoptions would find
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
barriers years as the division for
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
children youth and families will not
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
have access to the required data to
 
01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
complete the federal requirements I have
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
a very long list in the in in the um in
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
my written testimony so I will stop
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
there there are some technical and Hippa
 
01:35:42.109 --> 01:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
issues um HB 1689 creates these radical
 
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
and far-reaching changes on this
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
Authority and it impacts a number of not
 
01:35:49.709 --> 01:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
only state statutes but Federal statutes
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
it puts us in conflict with several
 
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
federal laws for example vital access to
 
01:35:57.149 --> 01:35:57.159 align:start position:0%
vital records information is required by
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
the federal Social Security acts in
 
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
order to implement the child support
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
program it puts us into a quandry when
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
it comes to Hippa as many of you know um
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
Hippa required the creation of a
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
national set of Standards to protect
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
sensitive patient health information the
 
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
is a HIPPA covered entity and so it
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
complies with those Federal requirements
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
to protect and and secure health
 
01:36:30.109 --> 01:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
information the Secretary of State's
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
office and their division of Vital
 
01:36:35.229 --> 01:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
Records is not a HIPPA covered entity
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
nor can it can it be so it puts us in a
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
difficult place because of that Hippa
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
standard it's the reason why I know
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt and others who
 
01:36:47.070 --> 01:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
have participated on some of the vital
 
01:36:49.149 --> 01:36:49.159 align:start position:0%
records privacy board that
 
01:36:52.109 --> 01:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility is given to the dhh s to
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
ensure the security of the health
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
related information because we're the
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
agency that is Hippa covered um HB 1689
 
01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
also proposes um eroding RSA
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
12624 and it removes the authority of
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
the department to Steward and and
 
01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
release that potentially private
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
information so this is a place where in
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
fact it may erode existing privacy
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
protections and may open the state up to
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
significant liability and potential
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
costs if there was a privacy be breach
 
01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
um or unintended receipt of that data
 
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
under DHHS control of the health
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
information the Privacy the data may
 
01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
actually be strengthened so there are
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
federal implications one of the other
 
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
pieces is just a reminder from last year
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
we know that about 10% of New Hampshire
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
residents give birth outside of New
 
01:37:51.149 --> 01:37:51.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in New Hampshire about 10%
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
% of our births are actually to
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
Residents from other states it makes
 
01:37:57.790 --> 01:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
that interchange between the birth
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
certificates very difficult and
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
something that we would have to to learn
 
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
more about and finally there's money I
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
will not you have the fiscal note in
 
01:38:08.669 --> 01:38:08.679 align:start position:0%
front of you the it the num the number
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
is indeterminable but it is certainly
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
north of tens and tens of millions of
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
dollars tens and millions of dollars of
 
01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
federal grants that the state will no
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
longer have because we will not be able
 
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
to meet our responsibilities for those
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
grants it is also the funds that would
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
take to unwind and redo our Data Systems
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
the tremendous amount of money that is
 
01:38:33.550 --> 01:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
on on the hook right now but more
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
importantly simply the services that the
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
that the people of New Hampshire depend
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
on the Department of Health and Human
 
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
Services for would not be able to be
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
completed and someone would have to do
 
01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
that or as as I noted our residents in
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would not have access to
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
the same s sort of services that
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
residents in every other state have we
 
01:38:58.750 --> 01:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
understand fully understand that New
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a strong tradition in
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
protecting privacy Above All Else and
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
because of this the department takes its
 
01:39:10.109 --> 01:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
role in protecting this sensitive and
 
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
private information incredibly seriously
 
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
we have rigorous user access to specific
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
data sets only a very limited number of

Staff have access to just the data they
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
need um we Implement rigorous training

01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
all like I know our colleagues do at the
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
vital at Vital Records we are committed
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
to using this information as authorized
 
01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
in current statute to help prevent poor

Hampshire residents have access to all
 
01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:55.719 align:start position:0%
the various social services and

assistance programs to which they are
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
entitled we believe that as a HIPPA
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
covered entity the department builds in
 
01:40:06.109 --> 01:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
those Safeguard safeguards those Vital
 
01:40:09.390 --> 01:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
Records data with protocols that secure
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
those personal identifiers and protect
 
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
confidentiality DHHS and the division of
 
01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
Vital Records have an efficient
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
effective relationship based on solid
 
01:40:24.589 --> 01:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
policy written M us and trust between
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
our two State agencies DHHS uses our
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
federal funding to help support their
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and modernization saving
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
General funds 1689 would fundamentally
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
change this relationship and would cause
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
frustration for for New Hampshire
 
01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
residents and will likely create
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
unfunded work for other state agencies
 
01:40:47.229 --> 01:40:47.239 align:start position:0%
we know this is a complex Bill we are
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
happy to work with the committee in any
 
01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:51.639 align:start position:0%
way that you see fit in in order to
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
untangle some of the web so thank
 
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you are there any
 
01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair and welcome
 
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh it's a pleasure to see
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
you as always uh and I do recall the
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill from last year very well and we had
 
01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
active participation at the time from
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
from several families and and you've
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
referenced brief in your in your
 
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
testimony the fact that some uh some ACT
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
actions have to be taken
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
immediately uh with
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
newborns uh to screen them for uh some
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
diseases or situations that uh can be
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
lifechanging um uh and we had several
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
families uh that that testified at the
 
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
time question representative Schmidt say
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
what your question please
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
yes so uh uh you will be available the
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
chair has already told me that there
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
will be a subcommittee so uh Will you
 
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
she already said she would be yes I we
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
will be we will make ourselves
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
completely available to the committee
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
and to the subcommittee we know that
 
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
families depend on the life-saving
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
connections that we make with um newborn
 
01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
screening um to address those rare
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
heritable conditions even though they're
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
rare it's very real for the families
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
that they impact so the question that
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
the chair has asked me to to put forward
 
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
apologize for the for the Preamble but
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
the reality is that the families that
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
are involved uh need to be notified so
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
that we can hear from them can you can
 
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
you we will do that yes thank you thank
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Gard you had a
 
01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
question NOP all right well that's fine
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
representative G thank you madam chair
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
just to make it clear you talked about
 
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
security of um the information
 
01:43:04.109 --> 01:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
electronically to the staff of Health
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
and Human Services so to make sure
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
everybody understands when you log
 
01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
in the security level is is attached to
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
your login into the computer system
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct and there's no
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
way for people to get around that
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
security system there is certainly no
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
way that I know of that people can get
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
around that security system and i' just
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
add quickly even I worked um on bridges
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
for DCF and I was in charge of reporting
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
so I had a really high security level
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
but when we had really hard uh need for
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
security there were even cases where
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
Flags could be put on that even at my
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
high security level I did not have
 
01:43:44.589 --> 01:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
access to information on those cases are
 
01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
you aware of situations like that AB
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely each one of us who works for
 
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
Service serves has roles assigned to us
 
01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
and it dictates what you can see and
 
01:43:56.669 --> 01:43:56.679 align:start position:0%
what you cannot see and the vast
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
majority of people cannot see anything
 
01:44:00.589 --> 01:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
that has personal identifiers attached
 
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
to it it's really very specific to your
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
very specific role that you can see that
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
box of data and that's hardwired into
 
01:44:10.270 --> 01:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
the data yes and we have folks if you
 
01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
have very detailed questions we have our
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
um head of Information Services here in
 
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
the gallery if there's deep questions
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
that you need to ask thank
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you for that um don't see any
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
other questions thank
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%

to oppose this bill because of the

to oppose this bill because of the
unintended

01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
consequences um currently the US has a
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
matern mortality crisis and one of the
 
01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
federal grants that New Hampshire
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
receives is for the maternal mortality
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
Review Committee that reviewes reviews
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
um maternal deaths and gets information
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
on what causes them
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
and um and be able to improve
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh another example is the the
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
infant screening that was
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
discussed um other funding like tanif
 
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
and captive that are used to help
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
families would lose funding as well
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire doesn't have the
 
01:46:01.629 --> 01:46:01.639 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to fund those programs
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
alone and so we need the personal
 
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
identifiers to be available to the
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
department um does anyone have any
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
questions all right are there
 
01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:15.080 align:start position:0%

House Bill
 
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
1689 okay thank you very much are there
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Brown uh
 
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and my apologies
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the committee as I'm new
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
to this and I don't have experience with
 
01:51:19.069 --> 01:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
your some of the history that's being
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
discussed here
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I I'm going to put this question to
 
01:51:25.229 --> 01:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
you that I could have probably put to
 
01:51:25.239 --> 01:51:26.830 align:start position:0%
you that I could have probably put to
others

01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
so why is it that this if this bill
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
passes that it will impact the health of
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
600 approximately 600 infants what piece
 
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
of information is there that doesn't get
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
passed along
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
somehow um can you can you elaborate a
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
little bit your second and last
 
01:51:45.629 --> 01:51:45.639 align:start position:0%
paragraph Yes Bill impacts the health of
 
01:51:48.589 --> 01:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
approximately 600 infants receiving life
 
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
saving care and treatment at etc etc
 
01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
what H how do and maybe someone in the
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee or others in the in the
 
01:51:58.589 --> 01:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
gallery could explain later how exactly
 
01:52:01.470 --> 01:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
does that impact I I don't understand
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
and subcommittee I would probably get
 
01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.910 align:start position:0%
and subcommittee I would probably get
that

01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
but how it will impact them uh they will
 
01:52:09.629 --> 01:52:09.639 align:start position:0%
not be receiving these Services these
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
are life saving Services Madam chair
 
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Brown the point is
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
that no one other than Vital Records
 
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
would have things like the name an
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
address of the mother or child so you
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't get in touch with them yes
 
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
implement these services or go to their
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
homes and provide these screening
 
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:33.560 align:start position:0%
services okay that's that's at least
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
part of it there's more but that's a
 
01:52:38.669 --> 01:52:38.679 align:start position:0%
okay I I will to later to the department
 
01:52:41.310 --> 01:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
for accurate accurate numbers that's
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
fine I I will I'll I'll learn more as we
 
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
go along thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you chair anyone else all
 
01:52:56.910 --> 01:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
Bradley good morning Madam chair members
 
01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Ben Bradley
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm the vice president of
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
government relations with the New
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
representing all of the state's 26
 
01:53:10.270 --> 01:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals um the hospital Association
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
has concerns uh about removing the
 
01:53:14.189 --> 01:53:14.199 align:start position:0%
Department's access to specific
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
identifiable information uh for the
 
01:53:19.229 --> 01:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
reasons outlined by the speakers uh that
 
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
came before for me specifically I just
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
want to note um the bill would prevent
 
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
the department from coordinating health
 
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
related birth and pregnancy information
 
01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
that support several Federal
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
designations uh including health
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
professional shortage areas medically
 
01:53:36.750 --> 01:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
underserved populations and maternity
 
01:53:39.310 --> 01:53:39.320 align:start position:0%
care target areas by not being able to
 
01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
identify those areas it would be
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to serve those areas with the
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
programs that the department can offer
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and so uh we're concerned about the
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
risk to our federally qualified Health
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
Center Partners as well as things like
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
um the student loan repayment programs
 
01:53:59.790 --> 01:53:59.800 align:start position:0%
for healthcare workers in various
 
01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
designations um and so for these reasons
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
among others outlined Again by others
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
that have spoken before me uh we can't
 
01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
support HP 1689 thank you for your time

hospital H all 26 hospitals have
 
01:54:25.870 --> 01:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record right EMR

one of my districts so it's a pleasure
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
to host you at the lob um I'm here to
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
present House Bill 1454 I'm the prime
 
01:57:46.589 --> 01:57:46.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor obviously I'm in support of this
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
bill um I've passed out an amendment to
 
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
this bill um with a little bit of a
 
01:57:53.709 --> 01:57:53.719 align:start position:0%
tweak to the amendment so an amendment
 
01:57:56.109 --> 01:57:56.119 align:start position:0%
to the amendment and I just want to be
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
very clear that there are two major
 
01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
changes with the amendment uh that are
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
different than the bill as introduced uh
 
01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
so if you take a look at the amendment
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
that I handed out um the intention of
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
this amendment which changes the
 
01:58:11.790 --> 01:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
original bill um is that we really want
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
to be sure that child care providers are
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
able to opt in to State health and
 
01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
dental benefits and the intent of this
 
01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is that the state will cover
 
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
the cost not the child care provider so
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh there was reference on lines 89 and
 
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
10 to the child care provider actually
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursing the state that is not the
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
intent of this amendment so that is
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
stricken in red just to be clear um and
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
we're referencing Amendment 2024
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
0184 um uh so that's been passed out
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
I've also emailed that to everyone uh
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
the email doesn't have these lines
 
01:58:48.669 --> 01:58:48.679 align:start position:0%
stricken but the intent once again is
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
that the child care providers are opting
 
01:58:53.470 --> 01:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
into state benefits and they are not um
 
01:58:54.910 --> 01:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
on the hook to pay for them the state
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
would pay for it um in addition the
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
change with this amendment which is
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
different than the bill as introduced is
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
that um the effective date is January 1
 
01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
2026 which puts us two years ahead um
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
and allows us to have a fiscal year
 
01:59:14.430 --> 01:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
right we would have a budget year to
 
01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
address financing for this program so uh
 
01:59:19.629 --> 01:59:19.639 align:start position:0%
the intent here is that we have enough
 
01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
time uh to figure out cost and figure
 
01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
out how to find the money for the cost
 
01:59:27.669 --> 01:59:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh there's a placeholder on line 19 of
 
01:59:27.679 --> 01:59:28.510 align:start position:0%
uh there's a placeholder on line 19 of
the

01:59:28.510 --> 01:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
amendment uh the sum of $1 is
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
appropriated to Department of
 
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
administrative services and obviously $1
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
is not enough it's a placeholder um so
 
01:59:39.629 --> 01:59:39.639 align:start position:0%
with that let me just give you a little
 
01:59:41.229 --> 01:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
bit more background about how we got
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
where we are and um the proposal for
 
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
this bill so as as you may be very aware
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire is in the midst of a
 
01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
child care emergency um parents can't
 
01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
work when they can't access Child Care
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and I I would say you've probably
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
heard this from all of your constituents
 
01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go in depth about it
 
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
there are people after me who will
 
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
testify to personal stories um but
 
02:00:05.709 --> 02:00:05.719 align:start position:0%
obviously we have a situation where we
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
have people who absolutely could be
 
02:00:08.910 --> 02:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
involved in the workforce but are unable
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
to because they can't get child care for
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
um a child who's not of school age yet
 
02:00:17.149 --> 02:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
um it's become untenable as a business
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
model for a child care facility to pay
 
02:00:22.270 --> 02:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
staff a competitive wage with
 
02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
Benefits turnover is high and no there
 
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
is no Financial way to retain quality
 
02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
staff meaning they reach a certain level
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
and they realize they can make more
 
02:00:34.430 --> 02:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
money in a different business doing
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
something else and they can no longer
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
work for Love Alone they need to
 
02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
actually get a job that pays the amount
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
of money they need to live in New
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this also puts New Hampshire
 
02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
Children at Risk because the people who
 
02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
are the most experienced and have the
 
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
most expert in child care in New
 
02:00:52.270 --> 02:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire end up being the ones who have
 
02:00:55.149 --> 02:00:55.159 align:start position:0%
to leave and turn over um and therefore
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
the business model itself is constantly
 
02:00:59.950 --> 02:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
recruiting new Young inexperienced folks
 
02:01:02.109 --> 02:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
to work in a child care facility and
 
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
then when they become experienced they
 
02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
move on um to meet the needs of New
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents we should be
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
treating child care and education as a
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
quasi Public Service rather than a
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
private business in order to meet our
 
02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
needs this bill shifts the burden of
 
02:01:20.430 --> 02:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
health and dental benefits to the state
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
rather than the child care facility
 
02:01:24.669 --> 02:01:24.679 align:start position:0%
allowing this quasi public private
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
business model as shifted with this uh
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
Bill to at least cover a portion of
 
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
those benefits so that the facility can
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
focus on wages and that employees can
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
stay because they have the benefits um
 
02:01:41.950 --> 02:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm happy to answer
 
02:01:44.109 --> 02:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
questions about this bill um and there
 
02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
are certainly plenty of people after me
 
02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
who are going to testify on some nuances
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
and specifics of the business business
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
um but I'm happy to take questions thank
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
you are there questions representative
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%

chair uh thank you for uh testify your
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
testimony and taking my question now if
 
02:02:05.629 --> 02:02:05.639 align:start position:0%
the child represen you're need to be
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
closer to your mic
 
02:02:12.990 --> 02:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
sorry if if the child care provider is
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
now not going to reimburse the state who
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
will reimburse the
 
02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:20.189 align:start position:0%
will reimburse the
state

02:02:20.189 --> 02:02:20.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
nobody the the intent is for an
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation to be made to cover this
 
02:02:27.709 --> 02:02:27.719 align:start position:0%
from State funds so taxpayer dollars
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers taxpayer dollars yes um okay
 
02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative laus thank you
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%

02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
chair can answer I
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
um you know I think before the committee
 
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
can vote to support this they need some
 
02:02:46.510 --> 02:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
idea of the cost is there going to be a
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal note can there be a fiscal note
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal well there is oh but
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
on the on the amendment though which is
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
the one that's going to
 
02:02:59.950 --> 02:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
be uh the next speaker is commissioner
 
02:03:02.189 --> 02:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
Arling house who will probably have some
 
02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
clue as to the costs okay thank you any
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative MC
 
02:03:09.669 --> 02:03:09.679 align:start position:0%
Williams representative
 
02:03:12.910 --> 02:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you madam chair it it's
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
still true I believe that state
 
02:03:16.270 --> 02:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
employees pay for a portion of their
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
benefits their health care
 
02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:19.470 align:start position:0%
benefits their health care
benefits

02:03:19.470 --> 02:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that I think it depends
 
02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
on the department and the way it's set
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
up uh having having been one I I believe
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
that is the case so this would give
 
02:03:31.229 --> 02:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
these people a better benefit package
 
02:03:33.629 --> 02:03:33.639 align:start position:0%
than a state employee if I'm seeing it
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
correctly I can't speak to that
 
02:03:41.350 --> 02:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately okay I think there's repr
 
02:03:44.589 --> 02:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
simman thank you madam chair um just
 
02:03:47.229 --> 02:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
thinking about this from a practical
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint um
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
it seems like what you're doing here is
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
a hybrid between State and private
 
02:03:57.629 --> 02:03:57.639 align:start position:0%
business is that correct yes in that
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
case did you give any consideration to
 
02:04:02.910 --> 02:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
the idea of having a limit to the
 
02:04:05.470 --> 02:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
profitability of the private business in
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
order to qualify for the program so if a
 
02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I know it's not likely but if a
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
child care facility was making a million
 
02:04:14.430 --> 02:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
dollars in profit a year why should we
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
extend state health benefits to them as
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to somebody who's maybe making
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
20,00 a year and barely scraping
 
02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:22.870 align:start position:0%
20,00 a year and barely scraping
by

02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
um that's a difficult question to answer
 
02:04:28.109 --> 02:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
because um based on my experience in the
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
last six years in the legislature and
 
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
studying this pretty extensively having
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
a study committee on the business of
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
child care um in
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
2018 um it doesn't appear that any
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
facilities are making a significant
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
profit to the extent that um you know
 
02:04:50.270 --> 02:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
the the CEO is able
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
to live a lavish lifestyle um this is
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
not that kind of a business
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
so having it means tested um could
 
02:05:02.910 --> 02:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
probably be something like on the very
 
02:05:04.589 --> 02:05:04.599 align:start position:0%
outside I would be concerned about
 
02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
embezzlement if that's what's going on
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
um but it could be on the very outside
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm not against guard rails for this
 
02:05:12.830 --> 02:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh but I would say the vast
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
majority of child care facilities in New
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are doing this out of love and
 
02:05:19.350 --> 02:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
out of the love for children and many
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
many of the owners of child care
 
02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
facilities are not business majors don't
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
really understand the business side and
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
when they have some small amount of
 
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
training or certificate program they
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
have a better sense of how to handle and
 
02:05:34.069 --> 02:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
stay in business but they're still not
 
02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
reaching that level of extreme
 
02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:39.470 align:start position:0%
reaching that level of extreme
profitability

02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
profitability
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
follow so once again with the with the
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
complexity of a hybrid model um if the
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
state is going to put forward
 
02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
significant resource ources because it
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
is a significant cost per person
 
02:05:58.589 --> 02:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
um do we run the risk of the state
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
essentially absorbing all of the child
 
02:06:04.109 --> 02:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
care facilities under its umbrella and
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
then becomes a state-run program um does
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
the state have any say at that point in
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
what must happen or must not happen at
 
02:06:13.629 --> 02:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
each individual Child Care Facility
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
because they are receiving significant
 
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
resources or with the child care
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
facilities from your perspective still
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
be able to do pretty much whatever they
 
02:06:25.149 --> 02:06:25.159 align:start position:0%
want regardless so we run into once
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
again issues that we always run into in
 
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
these scenarios um religious religiously
 
02:06:33.549 --> 02:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
organized Child Care Facilities versus
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
you know the whole RI
 
02:06:38.109 --> 02:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
ofo um so this is a very clear
 
02:06:39.629 --> 02:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
delineation where we're just talking
 
02:06:41.350 --> 02:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
about benefits being provided by the
 
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
state and to be super clear benefits is
 
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
not a common perk for employees of a
 
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
child care facility so this is really a
 
02:06:52.510 --> 02:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
carrot to say um you're a recent High
 
02:06:54.189 --> 02:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
School grad you're working at a child
 
02:06:56.189 --> 02:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
care facility understand that this
 
02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
position has never had benefits before
 
02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679 align:start position:0%
and now we're in the op in the position
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
to offer you benefits because it's state
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
covered um so it's adding a new layer of
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
a reason for people to stay in
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
employment and stay in the child care
 
02:07:10.030 --> 02:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
field as a career rather than as a
 
02:07:11.709 --> 02:07:11.719 align:start position:0%
starter and then move on elsewhere once
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
they've gained valuable experience and
 
02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
can't keep that institutional knowledge
 
02:07:18.069 --> 02:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
nonetheless um if we're just talking
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
about benefits and wanting to have
 
02:07:21.549 --> 02:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
strings attached with the benefits I
 
02:07:22.990 --> 02:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
understand that you have some concerns
 
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.149 align:start position:0%
understand that you have some concerns
about

02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:07:28.510 --> 02:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
um a facility uh I don't know acting
 
02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
poorly or acting badly and wanting some
 
02:07:34.030 --> 02:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
kind of uh a test um there really is no
 
02:07:35.709 --> 02:07:35.719 align:start position:0%
designation between religious and
 
02:07:37.589 --> 02:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
non-religious Child Care Facility I
 
02:07:39.310 --> 02:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
don't see the state needing to add some
 
02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
overlay on that um it really is a public
 
02:07:44.109 --> 02:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
private partnership that we're talking
 
02:07:46.549 --> 02:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
about um so similar to how we're doing
 
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts right now
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
where we take taxpayer dollars and we
 
02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
send it with the student wherever they
 
02:07:54.189 --> 02:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
choose to attend school I would say that
 
02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
this is benefits for a facility
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of their background whether
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
they are religious or a nonprofit or um
 
02:08:02.990 --> 02:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know just a mom and pop that's
 
02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:05.320 align:start position:0%
taking six children um and have one
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
assistant so that would be three staff
 
02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
you know that's sort of a situation um I
 
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what kind of tests you
 
02:08:13.470 --> 02:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
would be looking for on the state side
 
02:08:16.109 --> 02:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're um qualified
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
to receive
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
benefits so uh as I would see it the
 
02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
difference between this and an education
 
02:08:23.470 --> 02:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
Freedom account is specifically that
 
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're giving money to the child and the
 
02:08:27.149 --> 02:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
child's family and then the child can
 
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
choose to spend those funds wherever
 
02:08:31.629 --> 02:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
they see fit uh funds would not be going
 
02:08:35.549 --> 02:08:35.559 align:start position:0%
to the family to offer to the um Child
 
02:08:38.350 --> 02:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
Care Facility in order to provide uh
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
these this perk it would be going
 
02:08:43.149 --> 02:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
directly to the child care facility
 
02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:47.639 align:start position:0%
itself uh which is I believe still with
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a fundamental difference
 
02:08:52.189 --> 02:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
in in constitutional law as far as I
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
know at the moment um so yeah that would
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
I I would just for clarification
 
02:09:00.910 --> 02:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
purposes oh thank you for the
 
02:09:02.589 --> 02:09:02.599 align:start position:0%
clarification representative
 
02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you representative
 
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
Bara thank you good morning so what
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
would prevent other licensed Health Care
 
02:09:15.549 --> 02:09:15.559 align:start position:0%
Providers let's say from would this not
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
set presidence for other licensed
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Prov providers for the State
 
02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to also participate in
 
02:09:23.790 --> 02:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
this Healthcare program most to keep
 
02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:25.350 align:start position:0%
this Healthcare program most to keep
them

02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:09:28.270 --> 02:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
from from
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
joining I'm not sure I understand the
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
question this is allowing Child Care
 
02:09:35.149 --> 02:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
Facilities to opt into to state benefits
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
paid for by the state um if they were to
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
choose private insurance or go elsewhere
 
02:09:43.149 --> 02:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
that would be on them and they would be
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
paying for that out of pocket rather
 
02:09:47.069 --> 02:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
than and often they do I'm not saying
 
02:09:48.510 --> 02:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
nobody does this I'm just saying it's
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
not that common and so for staff
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
retention being able to offer benefits
 
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
is is a huge way to keep people on
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
followup follow up but you're setting AE
 
02:09:59.950 --> 02:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
we we would be you are not but we would
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
be setting a precedent and then
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
therefore why would what would prevent
 
02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
other licensed individuals from New
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who are in similar situations
 
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
as child care providers home health care
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
agencies for example right or you know
 
02:10:18.589 --> 02:10:18.599 align:start position:0%
Health agencies in the North Country mhm
 
02:10:20.350 --> 02:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
you know so what would prevent those
 
02:10:24.549 --> 02:10:24.559 align:start position:0%
individuals from seeking entry into this
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
system once we allow
 
02:10:29.229 --> 02:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
this so I can see your your concern
 
02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
about a slippery slope right we open the
 
02:10:33.229 --> 02:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
gate and then everyone wants in I just I
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
just want to say something it's not a
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
slippery slope so I don't I I that
 
02:10:40.990 --> 02:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
argument is I'm sorry but that's a Hut
 
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
button for me because that to me is
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
means nothing okay this sets of
 
02:10:48.750 --> 02:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
Precedence and so it would would allow
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
other individuals it is not a slippery
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
slope that argument should not be used
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
in legislation or by legislators thank
 
02:11:01.149 --> 02:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
you um sorry about thank you
 
02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
clarification so to respond to your
 
02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
concerns about um home health aids also
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
opting in to benefits paid for by the
 
02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
state or other um industries that are
 
02:11:13.549 --> 02:11:13.559 align:start position:0%
having difficulty retaining staff um and
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
doing what we know they need to do in
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
order for us to have a very productive
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
and successful state
 
02:11:20.910 --> 02:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
um I would say that that is our job as
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
legislators to determine what our future
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
policy is for the state um how we intend
 
02:11:28.270 --> 02:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
to retain young families and keep them
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
in the State uh and on this on the other
 
02:11:33.149 --> 02:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
end of the spectrum how we intend to
 
02:11:35.709 --> 02:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
keep Elders in the state right there is
 
02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
a real concern that if you can't get the
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
health care you need you may need to
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
leave the state right um so on either
 
02:11:43.350 --> 02:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
side we set the policy as legislators
 
02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
and we decide um what is and is not
 
02:11:48.189 --> 02:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
worthy of receiving a subsidy from the
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
state so that we can set the policy for
 
02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
the next 10 years I would posit that
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
this is an emergency situation for child
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
care we are not able as a state to
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
maintain the level of child care that we
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
need to keep young families here in the
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
state we know it it's a we have long
 
02:12:05.629 --> 02:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
long waiting lists for the existing
 
02:12:07.709 --> 02:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
child care facilities and so we're
 
02:12:09.390 --> 02:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
looking for Creative Solutions to
 
02:12:11.950 --> 02:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
maintain staff and attract staff um
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
Quality staff so that we can provide
 
02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
that support that families need for kids
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
in the state I don't know the situation
 
02:12:20.669 --> 02:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
with home health aids I'm not familiar
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
with um what the economics are of that
 
02:12:24.629 --> 02:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire so I'm sorry
 
02:12:26.109 --> 02:12:26.119 align:start position:0%
that I can't really give you the
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
comparison uh but I would say that if
 
02:12:30.149 --> 02:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
you have someone who comes forward if
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
this is signed if you have someone who
 
02:12:32.910 --> 02:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
comes forward next year with a bill
 
02:12:34.510 --> 02:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
about home health aids it would be a
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
very different debate about the
 
02:12:39.549 --> 02:12:39.559 align:start position:0%
economics of the situation and you know
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
we as legislators would make that
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
call thank you other
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions yes rever
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
Gard thank you madam
 
02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
chair just quick questions on the is
 
02:12:53.109 --> 02:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
there I didn't see it maybe you're
 
02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
missing something but employee limits
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
could this be a single soul
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
proprietorship that could operate and
 
02:13:00.430 --> 02:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
and acquire this benefit or would there
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
have to be a certain amount of employees
 
02:13:04.109 --> 02:13:04.119 align:start position:0%
no there's no limit it could be one
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
person it could be 20 people there's no
 
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
limit okay thank you right thank you for
 
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:12.800 align:start position:0%

02:13:15.310 --> 02:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair a quick question in terms of
 
02:13:18.430 --> 02:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
basically you're trying to expand the
 
02:13:20.549 --> 02:13:20.559 align:start position:0%
State Insurance Madam chair could could
 
02:13:22.109 --> 02:13:22.119 align:start position:0%
you we have her speak up I can't hear
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
you we can't hear you very
 
02:13:26.990 --> 02:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
well um basically you're trying to
 
02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
expand the
 
02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:31.599 align:start position:0%
self-insured State
 
02:13:31.599 --> 02:13:33.149 align:start position:0%
self-insured State
Insurance

02:13:33.149 --> 02:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
Insurance
 
02:13:38.109 --> 02:13:38.119 align:start position:0%
Group by adding more people to
 
02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
it yes this would add additional
 
02:13:44.669 --> 02:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
childcare employees to the state
 
02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
benefits provided to State Employees we
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
would be adding additional people to
 
02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:50.709 align:start position:0%
would be adding additional people to
that

02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:50.719 --> 02:13:52.510 align:start position:0%
that
group

02:13:52.510 --> 02:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:13:55.629 --> 02:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
okay of Gard yeah I have one more
 
02:13:58.510 --> 02:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
question just I'm done okay um the
 
02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
majority of people that work in the
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
child care facility are much younger
 
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
correct no uh it's it's a wide range of
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
Ages I would say that they're generally
 
02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
female but there's a wide range of Ages
 
02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
of people who work in child care all
 
02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:16.270 align:start position:0%
right thank

02:14:19.549 --> 02:14:19.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your uh
 
02:14:22.669 --> 02:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
testimony u i call director Arling house
 
02:14:28.109 --> 02:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:33.069 --> 02:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
sorry can I have Joyce come with me oh
 
02:14:36.270 --> 02:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
sure thank you uh I'm Charlie Arling
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
housee I'm the commissioner of the
 
02:14:39.549 --> 02:14:39.559 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
02:14:42.109 --> 02:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
and you are Joyce Pitman the director of
 
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
risk and benefits so uh and we're here
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
to to oppose the bill and it has nothing
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
to do with child care care or who wants
 
02:14:50.430 --> 02:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
the bill or what they want it for or
 
02:14:52.430 --> 02:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
anything like that I think Child Care is
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
a wonderful thing I believe children are
 
02:14:59.589 --> 02:14:59.599 align:start position:0%
a future Etc um it's uh historically so
 
02:15:01.149 --> 02:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
Services um through the division of risk
 
02:15:05.589 --> 02:15:05.599 align:start position:0%
and benefits runs the state employee
 
02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:08.119 align:start position:0%
health plan we run one Health Plan we
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
have 15 unions that bargain different
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
contracts but we have one Health Plan
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
historically over over uh for longer
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
than 10 years um before I was
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner before Joyce was director
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
under multiple governors of multiple
 
02:15:24.310 --> 02:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
parties um the department has has
 
02:15:27.790 --> 02:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
opposed similar legislation to this not
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
because we we uh and it has nothing to
 
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
do with it whether it's a health care or
 
02:15:34.109 --> 02:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
a chamber of commerce or anyone else we
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
run one Health Plan for state employees
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
that's what we do we don't we don't have
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
some people in some people out we don't
 
02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
run multiple plans we uh we have one
 
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
Health Plan um historically we've
 
02:15:50.830 --> 02:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
thought that um and the general position
 
02:15:54.189 --> 02:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
has been that um if you're going to
 
02:15:56.109 --> 02:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
Define who's in the health plan or not
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
you should have a uh a general criteria
 
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
for who can come in the health plan what
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
we would hate to see is that every year
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
there's a bill for this year it's Child
 
02:16:08.109 --> 02:16:08.119 align:start position:0%
Care next year it's the Chamber of
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
Commerce the year after it's home health
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
care agencies it's somebody all of who
 
02:16:14.189 --> 02:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
are whom are noble groups of people
 
02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
doing great work and we have a much
 
02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
richer health benefit than than anybody
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
else has a much more expensive health
 
02:16:24.589 --> 02:16:24.599 align:start position:0%
benefit than anybody else has and so um
 
02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
so people would naturally want to become
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
part of it and one year it'll be this
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
group that that um the committee thinks
 
02:16:32.509 --> 02:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
is wonderful this year and then you know
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
an election intervenes and there's a new
 
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
group of people sitting at this table
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
although a lot of the same ones one
 
02:16:40.429 --> 02:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
would hope um and there's a and there's
 
02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
another group that that's favored if you
 
02:16:44.190 --> 02:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
did something I think it should be
 
02:16:46.349 --> 02:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
criteria based but we run a healthc care
 
02:16:47.709 --> 02:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
plan for state employees we communicate
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
unate to health to State Employees we
 
02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
charge state employees and you might say
 
02:16:53.709 --> 02:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
aren't there some other people who are
 
02:16:54.910 --> 02:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
plan not really legislators are in the
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
plan who pay the entire Freight of their
 
02:17:03.309 --> 02:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
cost but the argument there is that
 
02:17:04.830 --> 02:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
they're kind of like state employees
 
02:17:07.469 --> 02:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
they're legislators um there are a
 
02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
couple of groups that used to be state
 
02:17:11.549 --> 02:17:11.559 align:start position:0%
employees cdfa which is sort of a quasi
 
02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
state agency they were state employees
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
they were on the health plan when they
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
became not exactly state employees they
 
02:17:20.910 --> 02:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
still on the health plan last year um
 
02:17:22.110 --> 02:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
and I think we're going to see a flurry
 
02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
of activity because of this the public
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
defender was added to the list the
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
public defender was added to the list
 
02:17:32.669 --> 02:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
not New Hampshire legal aid not Casa not
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
people who do noble things um to the
 
02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
benefit of of uh people who need defense
 
02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
but the public defender program um the
 
02:17:43.389 --> 02:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
argument for that at the time was that
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
the public defender program is
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
functionally a state agency that they
 
02:17:50.349 --> 02:17:50.359 align:start position:0%
are they receive their their income is
 
02:17:54.589 --> 02:17:54.599 align:start position:0%
100% a grant from the state in 48 or 49
 
02:17:56.830 --> 02:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
states it is an agency state government
 
02:17:59.230 --> 02:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
here we kind of sort of pretend it isn't
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
and and they come in they do come in
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
under the basis uh uh where they pay the
 
02:18:08.110 --> 02:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
premium cost and and the premium cost
 
02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
and I can get you exact numbers I
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
actually have exact numbers but the way
 
02:18:13.589 --> 02:18:13.599 align:start position:0%
to think about it we have a we have a
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
charge that we charge both the agency
 
02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
and the employee every empy employee
 
02:18:19.669 --> 02:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
pays a share it's a collectively
 
02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
bargained share and it's not very large
 
02:18:24.990 --> 02:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
but they pay a small bit it's it's
 
02:18:28.429 --> 02:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
functionally 11,000 for a single 22,000
 
02:18:32.150 --> 02:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
for a TW member plan and 35,000 for a
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
family plan those are rounded numbers
 
02:18:37.309 --> 02:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
but they're pretty close to that um I
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
say that because people are always a
 
02:18:41.230 --> 02:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
little bit surprised by that and and
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
periodically they will say oh you know
 
02:18:45.790 --> 02:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
what we want we would like to both be
 
02:18:47.790 --> 02:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
part of the plan and and can can we work
 
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
at a lower rate or can you have a a less
 
02:18:54.389 --> 02:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
Rich benefit for us and and I want to
 
02:18:56.030 --> 02:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
say there's some threshold things and
 
02:18:57.509 --> 02:18:57.519 align:start position:0%
we're happy to work with the committee
 
02:18:59.230 --> 02:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
if you go down this route there's a lot
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
of stuff we'd want to work with you on
 
02:19:02.709 --> 02:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
technically we really hope you don't go
 
02:19:04.589 --> 02:19:04.599 align:start position:0%
down this route but uh some of the
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
wording in the bill some of the language
 
02:19:07.629 --> 02:19:07.639 align:start position:0%
in the bill some of the things it refers
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
to that well that's not what we call
 
02:19:13.709 --> 02:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
that and things like that um but um they
 
02:19:16.190 --> 02:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
pay for that well if you've bought
 
02:19:19.790 --> 02:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
health insurance um um and I have a much
 
02:19:21.750 --> 02:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
better benefit than I did before I
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
worked for the state um but it was a lot
 
02:19:27.790 --> 02:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
cheaper the old one I mean right now it
 
02:19:29.150 --> 02:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
it is actually cheaper because the
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are paying my my benefit but
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
um but I also had a $10,000 deductible
 
02:19:38.030 --> 02:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know in my in my old plan but
 
02:19:40.309 --> 02:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we offer a plan and
 
02:19:43.830 --> 02:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
we offer it to State Employees and and
 
02:19:46.110 --> 02:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
we want for the future for that to still
 
02:19:49.150 --> 02:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
be the case and not um and not
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
periodically every year for there to be
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
another group of people added and
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
another group of people added and and
 
02:19:58.590 --> 02:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
and it's not it's not that I think the
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
state shouldn't do something to help
 
02:20:02.429 --> 02:20:02.439 align:start position:0%
people in the child care industry and
 
02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not the position of the
 
02:20:07.790 --> 02:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
department um or the or past governors
 
02:20:11.389 --> 02:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
or the current governor um but it's you
 
02:20:13.710 --> 02:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
know in for administrations of varying
 
02:20:15.990 --> 02:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
parties for example this has this has
 
02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
been the position and it's because of uh
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh administratively and that you know
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
you don't want to add some people this
 
02:20:24.030 --> 02:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
year some people this year some people
 
02:20:26.190 --> 02:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
this year and when you do add people
 
02:20:27.630 --> 02:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
they have to all be
 
02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
in that's the other thing and like the
 
02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
public defender program public defender
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
program is in they're not in if they
 
02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
want to be in they don't kind of get to
 
02:20:39.630 --> 02:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
be in all of them are in you're in
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
period because that you we we don't want
 
02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
adverse selection where just the people
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
who need knee surgery are getting in and
 
02:20:47.550 --> 02:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to get out in two years
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
and things like that and so but we're
 
02:20:51.950 --> 02:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
just generally opposed to this that's
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
most of it yeah but also happy to answer
 
02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
any technical questions people
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
have thank
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Shu and then man buy
 
02:21:05.230 --> 02:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning nice
 
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
to see you both again uh could you
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
explain please for the pertinence of
 
02:21:12.510 --> 02:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
this bill and probably for some of the
 
02:21:14.750 --> 02:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
newer members of this committee the
 
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
limits to the amounts that you use to
 
02:21:26.910 --> 02:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
plan the um oh I think I I think I do
 
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
know what you're asking that and and I
 
02:21:34.510 --> 02:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
want to separate out retiree Health
 
02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
which is limited by the state budget um
 
02:21:40.469 --> 02:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
and the the state of New Hampshire
 
02:21:42.830 --> 02:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
health benefit is a self-insured plan we
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
don't buy an insurance policy and since
 
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
about 2002 I think three I guess um we
 
02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
don't buy a insurance policy we we pay
 
02:21:54.270 --> 02:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
the premiums um but there well no there
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
isn't a
 
02:21:58.990 --> 02:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
limit so I mean functionally that that
 
02:22:00.030 --> 02:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:22:03.790 --> 02:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
we uh you're qualified for certain
 
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
benefits and if you use them if next
 
02:22:09.309 --> 02:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
year 10,000 people got knee surgery we
 
02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
have about 27,000 members if 10,000
 
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
people got knee surgery we would pay
 
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
10,000 knee surgeries and if 2,000
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
people got knee surgery we' paid 2,000
 
02:22:20.469 --> 02:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
knee surgeries and you know the rates
 
02:22:21.870 --> 02:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
and things like that are negotiated
 
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
through um our third party
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
administrator a followup followup and
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
and the rates would increase if the
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
expenses go up for those
 
02:22:36.190 --> 02:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
participating yes thank you represent
 
02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:37.469 align:start position:0%
participating yes thank you represent
man

02:22:37.469 --> 02:22:37.479 align:start position:0%
man
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
py thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:22:43.349 --> 02:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question commissioner um are
 
02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
foster care providers eligible to
 
02:22:50.750 --> 02:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
participate like the legislators
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
have no pay into no no one is eligible
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
to participate except um state employees
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
and that then the the caveats to that if
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
you want to call it that are legislators
 
02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
and now the public defender program
 
02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:06.710 align:start position:0%
and now the public defender program
that's

02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:23:09.630 --> 02:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
it they I mean nhrs is in because they
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
started in there's employ employees at
 
02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
P's who are we can argue about whether
 
02:23:16.510 --> 02:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
the state employees or not but but it
 
02:23:20.429 --> 02:23:20.439 align:start position:0%
dates to when they were in and and cdfa
 
02:23:23.429 --> 02:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
but those are the people who are
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
eligible yes yes repres gold thank you
 
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
question which is really more just a
 
02:23:33.550 --> 02:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
reinforcement I'd like you to reinforce
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
you answered my question about the
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
public defenders and I recall that um
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
that process we went through last year
 
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
very clearly and so for the new members
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
of our committee just wanting you to
 
02:23:48.030 --> 02:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
once again clarify
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
what set them apart from um from any
 
02:23:55.150 --> 02:23:55.160 align:start position:0%
other entity and and as I recall it and
 
02:23:57.469 --> 02:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
please correct me if I'm wrong it was
 
02:24:00.590 --> 02:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
that they operate under contract they do
 
02:24:04.230 --> 02:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
a necessary um process for the state
 
02:24:06.469 --> 02:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
that all other states have as a state
 
02:24:08.309 --> 02:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
agency but New Hampshire chooses to
 
02:24:11.550 --> 02:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
contract with only one agency is that
 
02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
correct I I think that's a that's a good
 
02:24:15.230 --> 02:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
description it's a constitutionally
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
required function that the state is
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
Contracting with an entity that and I
 
02:24:22.750 --> 02:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
think one of the important pieces
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
is we're not Contracting with a vendor
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
it is an entity that does nothing else
 
02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
it is an entity that raises no other
 
02:24:33.070 --> 02:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
money it's an entity whose entire budget
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
is granted them by the state and I mean
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
they're functionally part of judicial
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
Council they just happen to sort of not
 
02:24:42.910 --> 02:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
be and it is it is probably the only
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
thing in the entire state that you could
 
02:24:48.349 --> 02:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
refer to as a as functionally a state
 
02:24:51.429 --> 02:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
agency that it's a kind of weird thing
 
02:24:53.950 --> 02:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
that it's like that and I'm not I don't
 
02:24:55.309 --> 02:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
know why it's like that so maybe it
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
makes all the sense in the world
 
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
although it just outside looking and it
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
seems weird but that's
 
02:25:02.750 --> 02:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
why thank
 
02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
you represent flus uh thank you so just
 
02:25:08.429 --> 02:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
a couple questions on interpreting this
 
02:25:11.309 --> 02:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
one is um as I understand this would
 
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
have the state pay the entire cost which
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh it appears to me would be actually a
 
02:25:18.830 --> 02:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
better benefit than anybody else in the
 
02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:19.750 align:start position:0%
better benefit than anybody else in the
system

02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:25:22.349 --> 02:25:22.359 align:start position:0%
gets I if that's true and the other one
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
is um you know what what are the
 
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
problems with the thing where it looks
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
like a child care the company the
 
02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
employer can opt in or not opt out or
 
02:25:34.990 --> 02:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
not every two years make that decision
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
is that going to cause problems I the
 
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
the extent to which uh the extent to
 
02:25:43.710 --> 02:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
which small subgroups of of uh people
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
can opt in and out of plans um is the
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
greater the frequency the worse it is
 
02:25:51.710 --> 02:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
two years is better than one year four
 
02:25:54.670 --> 02:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
years is better than two years um opting
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
opting in or opting out it it it's best
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
if you know it certainly shouldn't be
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
the individual because that be it leads
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
to all sorts of adverse selection issues
 
02:26:06.670 --> 02:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
that that becomes an issue in terms of a
 
02:26:09.429 --> 02:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
so the amendment would technically the
 
02:26:10.750 --> 02:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
way it's written I don't know if this is
 
02:26:12.670 --> 02:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
the intention but would technically
 
02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
provide a better benefit we have a we
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
have a small co-pay um for uh for state
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
employees um we certainly don't pay 100%
 
02:26:24.190 --> 02:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
of anybody um at at some point although
 
02:26:26.349 --> 02:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sure the sponsors of the bill
 
02:26:28.110 --> 02:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
would say well we would accept the terms
 
02:26:32.349 --> 02:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
of the co-pay or whatever um but um the
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
notion of if you if you think about you
 
02:26:37.309 --> 02:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
know State reps are allowed to join you
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
you you have to
 
02:26:43.469 --> 02:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
pay 1122 or 35
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
and if you if you did go down this path
 
02:26:48.670 --> 02:26:48.680 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to pay that like
 
02:26:52.110 --> 02:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
there's nobody right now what happens is
 
02:26:54.389 --> 02:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
it's not in Joyce's budget we it's in
 
02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
every it's in every agency's budget it's
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
in the Personnel lines it's a it's a
 
02:27:00.510 --> 02:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
class 60 expense if you're reading the
 
02:27:03.389 --> 02:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
budget and so everybody who's in there's
 
02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
a there's a transfer every pay period
 
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
that goes into out of the state budget
 
02:27:11.070 --> 02:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
into into a separate thing which happens
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
to be called fund 60 and so you'd have
 
02:27:15.150 --> 02:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
to figure out I'm not saying that
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
couldn't be done anything can be done
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
you'd have to figure it out but
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the state budget would sit
 
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
the totality of the Grant and it would
 
02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
it would have to sit somewhere in the
 
02:27:27.269 --> 02:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
budget it wouldn't just sort of sort of
 
02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
be spent it would have to sit somewhere
 
02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
followup follow up I I know you may not
 
02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
have the actual numbers but can do you
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
have or can you come up with a just even
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
a very rough estimate of what this would
 
02:27:41.790 --> 02:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
cost I if if somebody to if somebody
 
02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
told me how many people would be joining
 
02:27:48.429 --> 02:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
and how many of them would be single how
 
02:27:49.990 --> 02:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
many of them would be double and how
 
02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
many would be family yeah easily but I
 
02:27:54.269 --> 02:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
would need that number like I I don't
 
02:27:56.750 --> 02:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
honestly know not having read all the
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
childcare reports if we're talking about
 
02:28:00.910 --> 02:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
a thousand people or 4,000 people and
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
and how many of them are likely to need
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
family coverage okay thank
 
02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:07.349 align:start position:0%
family coverage okay thank
you

02:28:07.349 --> 02:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:28:10.030 --> 02:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank thank you very
 
02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:11.710 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank thank you very
much

02:28:11.710 --> 02:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
Cowell

02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:27.269 --> 02:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
good morning how do you do my name is
 
02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
Jackie Cowell good morning Madame chair
 
02:28:30.910 --> 02:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
Jackie Cowell um I am the executive
 
02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
director of uh Early Learning New
 
02:28:38.590 --> 02:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are a Statewide nonprofit
 
02:28:41.070 --> 02:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
that works on childcare issues and so
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to urge you to support
 
02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
this bill and tell you why I think it
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
should be supported um
 
02:28:50.230 --> 02:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire today there's always
 
02:28:51.950 --> 02:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of you you know it is a noble
 
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for saying that commissioner
 
02:28:58.910 --> 02:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
um it is a noble and um career um but
 
02:29:01.269 --> 02:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's also a very important career to our
 
02:29:04.269 --> 02:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
economy and so the what we've learned
 
02:29:07.309 --> 02:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
you know is that for you know every
 
02:29:09.070 --> 02:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a childcare Workforce
 
02:29:11.469 --> 02:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
crisis but there is in every industry
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
almost every industry today in New
 
02:29:14.830 --> 02:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of lots of different
 
02:29:17.349 --> 02:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
reasons you all know them um is facing a
 
02:29:19.870 --> 02:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce crisis Child Care businesses
 
02:29:22.950 --> 02:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
are no different what is different is
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
that um child care employs what we call
 
02:29:28.950 --> 02:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
the workforce behind the workforce when
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
a teacher resigns as many as eight
 
02:29:34.349 --> 02:29:34.359 align:start position:0%
children on average will not have child
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
care which means their parents then may
 
02:29:38.910 --> 02:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
have to leave the labor force there's a
 
02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
real direct connection between the
 
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
people working in child care and then
 
02:29:47.269 --> 02:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
who in all other Industries are able to
 
02:29:50.590 --> 02:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
actually work or not we're also finding
 
02:29:53.990 --> 02:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
that prior to the pandemic we have fewer
 
02:29:57.150 --> 02:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities fewer slots a child care
 
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
center for instance um may have been
 
02:30:02.830 --> 02:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
running for years decades with 10
 
02:30:04.830 --> 02:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
classrooms they're now running with nine
 
02:30:07.150 --> 02:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
or eight be you know because they cannot
 
02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
find people to do this work so this
 
02:30:12.630 --> 02:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
particular bill is designed to be a very
 
02:30:15.469 --> 02:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
specific Bill to support the workforce
 
02:30:18.269 --> 02:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
behind the workforce to allow our labor
 
02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
force to go to work and so what we're
 
02:30:24.190 --> 02:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
learning again is that um you know these
 
02:30:26.190 --> 02:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
class rooms they're still there but they
 
02:30:27.469 --> 02:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
were all they've been running for
 
02:30:28.670 --> 02:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
decades but they haven't been running
 
02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
for a few years now because they can't
 
02:30:32.710 --> 02:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
find the people we want to retain the
 
02:30:34.349 --> 02:30:34.359 align:start position:0%
people and your good question about the
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
ages you know the people that are in the
 
02:30:39.269 --> 02:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
you know I think what's going to be part
 
02:30:41.349 --> 02:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
of doing this and having it come next
 
02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
year with good look at what is the size
 
02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
of it's 5,500 people is what the
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
estimate is right now how old they are
 
02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
whether they have spouses and families
 
02:30:55.429 --> 02:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
or two people that has not been studied
 
02:30:57.670 --> 02:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
but that can be part of what we look at
 
02:31:00.830 --> 02:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
to determine what it would cost but also
 
02:31:03.389 --> 02:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
to to talk together about the criteria
 
02:31:06.990 --> 02:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
of why why this Workforce why would you
 
02:31:09.950 --> 02:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
do that for this Workforce there are
 
02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
nonprofit childcare programs there are
 
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
privately owned Child Care programs we
 
02:31:17.190 --> 02:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know the the technical could be
 
02:31:19.790 --> 02:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
for-profit but um representative Simon
 
02:31:21.230 --> 02:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
there aren't too many out there making a
 
02:31:24.510 --> 02:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars I know you know that but
 
02:31:26.230 --> 02:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
interesting criteria that you mentioned
 
02:31:27.510 --> 02:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know so that you don't want people
 
02:31:29.469 --> 02:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
who could afford it to just take it I
 
02:31:33.389 --> 02:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
get that but um um I've no many Child
 
02:31:35.269 --> 02:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
Care owners today they they they own it
 
02:31:38.670 --> 02:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a privately owned business
 
02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
um they haven't been taken salary for
 
02:31:43.389 --> 02:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
about two years um because the math just
 
02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't work when you give people
 
02:31:48.510 --> 02:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
benefits When when you pay their wages
 
02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
where is the number one place you're
 
02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
going to find that Revenue it's the
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
Working Families it's the tuition that
 
02:31:56.349 --> 02:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
the Working Families are paying we all
 
02:31:58.590 --> 02:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
know it's tough to pay it already let
 
02:31:59.830 --> 02:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
alone if we give them more health
 
02:32:01.349 --> 02:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
insurance it's going to come have to
 
02:32:03.790 --> 02:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
come from the work hardworking families
 
02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
and so that's why this bill is really
 
02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
proposing at looking at this being a a
 
02:32:11.550 --> 02:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
public private partnership because Child
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
Care supports all Industries and all
 
02:32:16.110 --> 02:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
labor the labor force in New Hampshire
 
02:32:18.670 --> 02:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
and and um we're not just you know
 
02:32:20.590 --> 02:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
supporting today's Workforce childcare
 
02:32:22.510 --> 02:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
helps prepare the workforce of the
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
future of course the children that are
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
in there so um a child care you know
 
02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
provider right now a teacher going to
 
02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
work will stop at McDonald's and she's
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
going to make she's probably been in the
 
02:32:35.469 --> 02:32:35.479 align:start position:0%
field for about five years and is making
 
02:32:35.479 --> 02:32:36.349 align:start position:0%
field for about five years and is making
about

02:32:36.349 --> 02:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:32:39.630 --> 02:32:39.640 align:start position:0%
1315 an hour after all that time she
 
02:32:41.469 --> 02:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
drives up to McDonald's and she's the
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
big sign $18 an hour to start and we're
 
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
going to pay your health benefits we're
 
02:32:47.710 --> 02:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
going to send you to school you know so
 
02:32:49.269 --> 02:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
it's harder and harder to stay in the
 
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
field and it's harder and harder to
 
02:32:53.710 --> 02:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
recruit so I I urge you to support this
 
02:32:56.710 --> 02:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
bill to keep it um ought you have it
 
02:32:58.510 --> 02:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
ought to pass so we can have that
 
02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
discussion we can do those studies we
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
can really look at what the cost would
 
02:33:06.190 --> 02:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
be and the why together thank you thank
 
02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
you are there any
 
02:33:11.469 --> 02:33:11.479 align:start position:0%
questions repr Simon thank you madam
 
02:33:14.710 --> 02:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for your testimony um
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
from your perspective you're saying um
 
02:33:19.309 --> 02:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
an average uh childcare worker is making
 
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
13 to 15 and they see the sign at
 
02:33:24.750 --> 02:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
McDonald's for $18 to $20 an hour um so
 
02:33:26.349 --> 02:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
from your perspective even in the
 
02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
disparity and the pay gap having this
 
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
particular health insurance would close
 
02:33:33.710 --> 02:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
the gap for people who would typically
 
02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
be in that field I think it would really
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
help them stay I think it would really
 
02:33:39.950 --> 02:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
help them come to the field I do yeah
 
02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:46.990 --> 02:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I if I may yes um I I did just
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
looked right before this there were some
 
02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
other people coming to testify um they
 
02:33:52.469 --> 02:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
couldn't get out because there weren't
 
02:33:55.830 --> 02:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
enough staff but uh online you will see
 
02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
um there's right now I believe about 536
 
02:34:01.269 --> 02:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
people who did uh right in in their
 
02:34:04.389 --> 02:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
support thank you thank you for that
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
information I don't see any other
 
02:34:09.429 --> 02:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
question so thank you is there anyone
 
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
else who wishes to testify on House Bill
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
1454 see any so I will close the hearing
 
02:34:31.389 --> 02:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:35.110 --> 02:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
1546 is representative Corker in
 
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:46.590 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:34:46.590 --> 02:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
any representative corkran Hillsboro 44
 
02:35:00.510 --> 02:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
um my testimony on this bill is fairly
 
02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
simple it is uh unreasonable to um ask a
 
02:35:08.670 --> 02:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer to support uh not only uh
 
02:35:10.429 --> 02:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
attitudes but active discrimination
 
02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
against his own category um it is
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
everyone's right as an individual to
 
02:35:16.830 --> 02:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
make their own purchasing decisions and
 
02:35:19.230 --> 02:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
you know if uh someone is a hardcore
 
02:35:21.269 --> 02:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
rtist and they dislike Ben and Jerry's
 
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
political stances they don't have to buy
 
02:35:25.269 --> 02:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
Ben and Jerry ice cream if someone is a
 
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh left of center they can choose to buy
 
02:35:29.630 --> 02:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
their groceries from an organic bakery
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
or whatever but when it comes to
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
government purchasing things on our
 
02:35:37.309 --> 02:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
behalf uh we lose this right um it is
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
illegal uh both at state level and at
 
02:35:42.030 --> 02:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
Federal level to discriminate on the
 
02:35:44.110 --> 02:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
basis of certain categories race
 
02:35:46.349 --> 02:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
religion Etc but as we all know this
 
02:35:48.269 --> 02:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
happens all the time there's certain
 
02:35:50.750 --> 02:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
approved directions and unapproved
 
02:35:54.070 --> 02:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
directions this bill uh simply forbids
 
02:35:55.790 --> 02:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
state and town governments from
 
02:35:57.389 --> 02:35:57.399 align:start position:0%
purchasing from corporations that
 
02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
practice active discrimination on race
 
02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
and sex um I think that there are two U
 
02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
protests against this bill we don't need
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
it because it doesn't happen in which
 
02:36:09.469 --> 02:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
case I would say then once the uh you
 
02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
know if the bill were to be enacted in
 
02:36:12.990 --> 02:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
law uh we would see no activity there
 
02:36:14.590 --> 02:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
would be no cases where anyone would
 
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
find uh that the state where towns were
 
02:36:18.910 --> 02:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing um from organizations that
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
were engaged in discrimination uh and
 
02:36:22.590 --> 02:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
the other one you know there's a joke
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
online it's not happening and it's good
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
that it is uh so you know if the
 
02:36:28.830 --> 02:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
objection is well you know this is going
 
02:36:30.429 --> 02:36:30.439 align:start position:0%
to create new court cases because people
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
are going to be bringing challenges
 
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
under this I would say you know that's
 
02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
sort of like saying we shouldn't pass a
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
law against arson because it's going to
 
02:36:38.630 --> 02:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
increase the demand on our police and
 
02:36:41.389 --> 02:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
courts U that's the entirety of my
 
02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
testimony and happy to answer questions
 
02:36:46.510 --> 02:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
good thank you I I have a a question and
 
02:36:49.710 --> 02:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
then Representative Patrick so you said
 
02:36:52.590 --> 02:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
that this discrimination is
 
02:36:56.389 --> 02:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
illegal yes right thank you
 
02:36:58.150 --> 02:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative Fitzpatrick thank you
 
02:37:00.750 --> 02:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair how would you
 
02:37:04.230 --> 02:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
know how would I know yeah what's your
 
02:37:05.550 --> 02:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
what's your
 
02:37:08.110 --> 02:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
criteria for for stating that it's
 
02:37:11.870 --> 02:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
illegal currently for saying that anyone
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
is meeting whatever criteria you're you
 
02:37:16.349 --> 02:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
want to create
 
02:37:19.469 --> 02:37:19.479 align:start position:0%
to not purchase from um you know I think
 
02:37:22.150 --> 02:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
that in general uh the courts find it
 
02:37:24.309 --> 02:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know quite easy to you know uh
 
02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
enforce their own Rules of Evidence uh
 
02:37:28.750 --> 02:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
and in this case we go into some data uh
 
02:37:30.429 --> 02:37:30.439 align:start position:0%
or some specific examples of what would
 
02:37:33.309 --> 02:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
be included so if for example uh someone
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
said you know the state is purchasing um
 
02:37:39.389 --> 02:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
you know snowplows from you know the uh
 
02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
snowplow Corporation of Saskatchewan and
 
02:37:44.309 --> 02:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
the snowplow Corporation of Saskatchewan
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
says you know we proudly
 
02:37:48.309 --> 02:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know promote people of certain

races and certain Sexes um you know uh
 
02:37:54.429 --> 02:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
regardless of their capabilities or you
 
02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
know to the detriment because we're not
 
02:37:57.630 --> 02:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
looking at individual skills and it is
 
02:37:58.990 --> 02:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the case that lots of
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
Corporations practice this and proudly
 
02:38:02.750 --> 02:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
brag about
 
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:05.880 align:start position:0%

might um a line six uh excuse me line
 
02:38:20.359 --> 02:38:22.510 align:start position:0%
might um a line six uh excuse me line
eight

02:38:22.510 --> 02:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
eight
 
02:38:25.590 --> 02:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
yes can you clarify for me I I
 
02:38:26.750 --> 02:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
understand the beginning of the
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
statement that they we shall not
 
02:38:31.150 --> 02:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
contract for a company that
 
02:38:34.670 --> 02:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
discriminates and hiring uh Etc through
 
02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:35.710 align:start position:0%
discriminates and hiring uh Etc through
line

02:38:35.710 --> 02:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:38:38.910 --> 02:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
8 including but limited to permitting
 
02:38:43.150 --> 02:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
Dei statements so are do you know are
 
02:38:46.510 --> 02:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
Dei statements included in the law
 
02:38:48.389 --> 02:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
similarly to the Discrimination
 
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
statements about sex race sexuality and
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
national origin Etc the intent of the
 
02:38:55.469 --> 02:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
bill as written is that uh Dei
 
02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
statements uh as part of a corporate
 
02:38:59.309 --> 02:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
policy would serve as evidence that the
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
corporation is engaged in
 
02:39:05.550 --> 02:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination so I think that's a no to
 
02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:06.309 align:start position:0%
discrimination so I think that's a no to
my

02:39:06.309 --> 02:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:39:11.150 --> 02:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you yeah uh followup
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:22.750 --> 02:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
17 would this be that you're guilty
 
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
innocent uh no I believe that's
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
incorrect um line 14 and 15 uh says that
 
02:39:38.030 --> 02:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
the uh citizen or the Attorney General
 
02:39:40.830 --> 02:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
shall have the burden uh to prove it and
 
02:39:43.389 --> 02:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
if they have proven it um this is sort
 
02:39:47.830 --> 02:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
of a reverse the um you know if the
 
02:39:50.349 --> 02:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
citizen has proven primashe evidence
 
02:39:52.910 --> 02:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
that uh this discrimination exists that
 
02:39:55.630 --> 02:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
the uh Corporation or excuse me the uh
 
02:39:57.469 --> 02:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
purchasing uh body you know a town or
 
02:40:00.910 --> 02:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
the state uh could you know use the uh
 
02:40:04.150 --> 02:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
procedure in 16 and 17 to say you know
 
02:40:05.510 --> 02:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
you made a good showing but you missed
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
some details we're going to show why
 
02:40:09.070 --> 02:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
actually that's incorrect okay thank you
 
02:40:13.349 --> 02:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
and may I one more one more having thank
 
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
you madam chair having
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
been a state employee and done more
 
02:40:22.269 --> 02:40:22.279 align:start position:0%
contracts than I would like to
 
02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
remember there there were cases in my
 
02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
history where you would go to a vendor
 
02:40:29.830 --> 02:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
and they would say it's just too hard to
 
02:40:32.030 --> 02:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
do the state contract we're not going to
 
02:40:34.230 --> 02:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
put in a quote and and that's not an
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
unusual because it's a much more
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
complicated process Than A
 
02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
Private Industry do you see that this
 
02:40:43.309 --> 02:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
additional piece would make that happen
 
02:40:46.429 --> 02:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
more often that companies we would be
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
the state would not have access to as
 
02:40:51.670 --> 02:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
many reasonable quotes as you might get
 
02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise I I do understand the question
 
02:40:55.990 --> 02:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's a good question um I have two
 
02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
responses uh one is that I think that
 
02:41:02.110 --> 02:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's uh purchasing is uh much
 
02:41:05.550 --> 02:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
less um wrapped in requirements than
 
02:41:08.110 --> 02:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
certain other states um and so you know
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
if uh the state of California or the
 
02:41:11.389 --> 02:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
state of New York you know walk in with
 
02:41:13.389 --> 02:41:13.399 align:start position:0%
their 700 page you know standard
 
02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
contract um you know corporate and and
 
02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know I've done purchasing I've been
 
02:41:18.870 --> 02:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
on the other side of as small vendor
 
02:41:21.269 --> 02:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
trying to sell into places um you know
 
02:41:23.550 --> 02:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
corporations tend to sort themselves as
 
02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
yes we're in the business of supplying
 
02:41:27.230 --> 02:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
pickup trucks to government's and here
 
02:41:29.950 --> 02:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
are our 900 pages of answers um I don't
 
02:41:32.150 --> 02:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
think that this would add appreciably uh
 
02:41:34.349 --> 02:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
the second answer is I think that it's
 
02:41:36.269 --> 02:41:36.279 align:start position:0%
you know quite simple for a corporation
 
02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
to say uh you know yes we sell snowplows
 
02:41:40.349 --> 02:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
and no we certainly don't discriminate
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
on Race because it's illegal under
 
02:41:43.990 --> 02:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
federal law to do so so you know I'd be
 
02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
happy to sign a Post-It not note to that
 
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
effect it's very simple uh thank you
 
02:41:50.230 --> 02:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair appreciate that
 
02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:51.870 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair appreciate that
okay

02:41:51.870 --> 02:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:53.870 align:start position:0%
okay
questions

02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:41:56.750 --> 02:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
faart looking at the looking at the
 
02:42:00.349 --> 02:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal note yes second to last page
 
02:42:02.349 --> 02:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
second paragraph the Department of
 
02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
Justice States this bill could impact
 
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
thousands of contracts across the state
 
02:42:07.269 --> 02:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
counties municipalities potentially
 
02:42:08.990 --> 02:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
leading to a surge in complaints managed
 
02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
by the Attorney General's
 
02:42:12.950 --> 02:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
office screening for compliance might
 
02:42:14.349 --> 02:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
become essential for State contracts
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
demanding increased time in resources
 
02:42:17.710 --> 02:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
but this is already illegal isn't that
 
02:42:20.910 --> 02:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
their job to is my understanding
 
02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:23.550 align:start position:0%
their job to is my understanding
yes

02:42:23.550 --> 02:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:42:26.349 --> 02:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
yes that's the usual sort of thing the
 
02:42:28.910 --> 02:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice says you're making
 
02:42:31.710 --> 02:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
something more of a crime therefore it's
 
02:42:33.670 --> 02:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
possible it might cause more costs in
 
02:42:36.630 --> 02:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
the court system the and and I would say
 
02:42:38.230 --> 02:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know I sort of pre- address this
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
with I I do see one or two objections uh
 
02:42:43.389 --> 02:42:43.399 align:start position:0%
and you know this objection is you know
 
02:42:45.030 --> 02:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
wait we can't pass this bill if we had a
 
02:42:46.710 --> 02:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
bill like this we would no longer be
 
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to buy from the anti-chinese uh
 
02:42:52.150 --> 02:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
you know steering wheel Corporation of
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
Nebraska um uh if it turned out to be
 
02:42:56.469 --> 02:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
the case that you know people are saying
 
02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
hey uh did you know that you are
 
02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
purchasing you know heating fuel from a
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
corporation you know that discriminates
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
on the race of such and such uh I I
 
02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
would think that uh that would be an
 
02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement action that we would be
 
02:43:09.550 --> 02:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
happy to take represent
 
02:43:12.710 --> 02:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
laus uh my question is if if this
 
02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
activity is already illegal uh why not
 
02:43:18.550 --> 02:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
deal with it you know you know go after
 
02:43:21.309 --> 02:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
the company for doing that rather than
 
02:43:23.230 --> 02:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
burdening every single Department in the
 
02:43:24.150 --> 02:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
state that's going to be doing
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
procurement with trying to vet all these
 
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
companies I mean that's not really you
 
02:43:30.070 --> 02:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
know the function of the department
 
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
they're trying to plow snow or whatever
 
02:43:34.389 --> 02:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
um but I mean there are aren't there
 
02:43:38.269 --> 02:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
paths to go after discrimination as it's
 
02:43:40.190 --> 02:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
that is a good question um and my answer
 
02:43:41.990 --> 02:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
to that is twofold on the first hand we
 
02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
all understand the distinction between a
 
02:43:47.950 --> 02:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
uh Criminal case and a civil case um and
 
02:43:50.070 --> 02:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
so you know all of the time uh an
 
02:43:52.190 --> 02:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
attorney general will say you know I
 
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
know something's going on here but this
 
02:43:55.150 --> 02:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
isn't a you know Department priority I'm
 
02:43:56.269 --> 02:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
going to have to jump through so many
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hoops I'm going to have to prove Beyond
 
02:44:00.670 --> 02:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
a reasonable doubt that this guy uh you
 
02:44:01.990 --> 02:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
know threw a pack of cigarettes out the
 
02:44:04.269 --> 02:44:04.279 align:start position:0%
window you know it's not going to happen
 
02:44:07.309 --> 02:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh and with civil cases there is uh a
 
02:44:09.630 --> 02:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
lower bar although you know not trivial
 
02:44:12.429 --> 02:44:12.439 align:start position:0%
the second one is that um you know I
 
02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
could walk into the Attorney General's
 
02:44:16.670 --> 02:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
office right now and uh say that you
 
02:44:18.269 --> 02:44:18.279 align:start position:0%
know I have clear and convincing
 
02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
evidence that um the state of New
 
02:44:22.150 --> 02:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is purchasing you know $15
 
02:44:24.830 --> 02:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
million of such and such and that uh
 
02:44:26.910 --> 02:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
firm has a explicit policy right on
 
02:44:28.469 --> 02:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
their web page that we discriminate
 
02:44:30.590 --> 02:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
against you know certain category and
 
02:44:33.790 --> 02:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
the attorney general who is you know not
 
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh and and this isn't a criticism it's
 
02:44:36.510 --> 02:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
just a statement of how things are
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
organized he is not responsible to the
 
02:44:40.590 --> 02:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
voters uh he can say you know I hear
 
02:44:42.230 --> 02:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
what you're saying that's not my
 
02:44:44.830 --> 02:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
priority um and yet as a individual
 
02:44:47.230 --> 02:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
voter and taxpayer I still say well you
 
02:44:49.870 --> 02:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
know I am paying uh taxes every day that
 
02:44:52.389 --> 02:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
you know um go in and it's going to you
 
02:44:53.710 --> 02:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
know imagine that I have a
 
02:44:56.110 --> 02:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
Asian-American wife uh I'm paying taxes
 
02:44:57.910 --> 02:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
to a firm that explicitly discriminates
 
02:45:00.030 --> 02:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
against asian-americans and you know I'm
 
02:45:01.469 --> 02:45:01.479 align:start position:0%
not going to say that that's exactly
 
02:45:03.269 --> 02:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
compelled speech but it has a flavor
 
02:45:05.110 --> 02:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
similar to compelled speech I'm being
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
compelled to expend you know the uh the
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
fruits of my labor uh to engage in an
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
activity albeit indirectly that you know
 
02:45:14.190 --> 02:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
I find repugnant uh so by having a right
 
02:45:16.190 --> 02:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
of private action this is distinct from
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
existing uh laws thank
 
02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
02:45:23.309 --> 02:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:45:25.429 --> 02:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your time uh the
 
02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:46.110 --> 02:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
jovit thank you thank you Mr chair
 
02:45:48.269 --> 02:45:48.279 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:45:51.309 --> 02:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
my name is Dave juv I a senior vice
 
02:45:53.710 --> 02:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
president for public policy for the
 
02:45:56.429 --> 02:45:56.439 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association I'm
 
02:45:59.309 --> 02:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
not before this committee very often so
 
02:46:01.110 --> 02:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are not familiar
 
02:46:03.830 --> 02:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
with the Bia we serve as New Hampshire's
 
02:46:06.389 --> 02:46:06.399 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce we have
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
approximately 400 employer members who
 
02:46:12.510 --> 02:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
are providing employment to over a
 
02:46:16.190 --> 02:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
100,000 Granite Staters we're here in
 
02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
opposition to this
 
02:46:24.309 --> 02:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
bill and I'll Focus my comments on
 
02:46:28.469 --> 02:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
line8 where it starts out talking about
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
um discrimination on the basis of sex
 
02:46:34.790 --> 02:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
race sexuality national origin ethnicity
 
02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:36.429 align:start position:0%
race sexuality national origin ethnicity
or

02:46:36.429 --> 02:46:36.439 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:46:38.510 --> 02:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
ideology which I think we could probably
 
02:46:41.309 --> 02:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
all agree to and which are commonly
 
02:46:44.670 --> 02:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
understood um issues of discrimination
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
that are covered under law but then it
 
02:46:49.150 --> 02:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
adds but not limited to permitting
 
02:46:52.750 --> 02:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion
 
02:46:56.349 --> 02:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
statements for the employers who have
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion
 
02:47:02.349 --> 02:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
statements which may be worded in 10,000
 
02:47:05.950 --> 02:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
different ways I think they would take
 
02:47:08.830 --> 02:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
exception to and probably be offended by
 
02:47:12.590 --> 02:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
the suggestion that that equates to
 
02:47:15.030 --> 02:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh so we would oppose the
 
02:47:19.630 --> 02:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
bill just based on that you're um this
 
02:47:22.110 --> 02:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
is essentially this
 
02:47:24.750 --> 02:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
bill is the state of New Hampshire
 
02:47:27.870 --> 02:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
telling private sector employers what
 
02:47:30.590 --> 02:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
they think they should do or shouldn't
 
02:47:32.510 --> 02:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
do in the best interest of their
 
02:47:34.950 --> 02:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
employees and customers and I don't
 
02:47:36.750 --> 02:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
right I also think it will could lead
 
02:47:45.230 --> 02:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
to extraordinarily increased litigation
 
02:47:48.030 --> 02:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
that employers uh may be able to quickly
 
02:47:51.429 --> 02:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
dispense with but at some cost and I
 
02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
question the very premise of the bill as
 
02:47:57.510 --> 02:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
it was presented which is why should
 
02:48:00.670 --> 02:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire have their
 
02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money sent to companies that
 
02:48:07.429 --> 02:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
have diversity equity and inclusion
 
02:48:09.630 --> 02:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
statements I would
 
02:48:12.950 --> 02:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
ask if only their opinion counts why
 
02:48:15.750 --> 02:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
aren't we considering the citizens of
 
02:48:18.590 --> 02:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
the state who would like their tax money
 
02:48:20.710 --> 02:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
directed to companies that have
 
02:48:22.830 --> 02:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion
 
02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
statements the fact is you're just
 
02:48:27.469 --> 02:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
opening up a can of worms which is bad
 
02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
enough but we this to go forward it is
 
02:48:32.950 --> 02:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
essentially the state of New Hampshire
 
02:48:35.590 --> 02:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
saying if you're a company that for
 
02:48:37.630 --> 02:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
whatever reason you choose to have
 
02:48:39.389 --> 02:48:39.399 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion
 
02:48:42.710 --> 02:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
statements is a part of your uh business
 
02:48:45.150 --> 02:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
you're not welcome in this state and I
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
think that's not a good place for New
 
02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be happy to answer any
 
02:48:52.269 --> 02:48:52.279 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair thank you very
 
02:48:55.870 --> 02:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
02:48:59.269 --> 02:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
testimony uh could you give us an idea
 
02:49:02.510 --> 02:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
how complicated and time consuming it
 
02:49:04.950 --> 02:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
might be for these entities to
 
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
investigate the companies that they do
 
02:49:10.790 --> 02:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
business with for meeting these um
 
02:49:13.670 --> 02:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
criteria I I don't even begin to
 
02:49:15.429 --> 02:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
understand how this bill would be
 
02:49:18.269 --> 02:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
enforceable and how the various entities
 
02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
of state county and local governments
 
02:49:23.950 --> 02:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
would assess whether a company's uh
 
02:49:26.870 --> 02:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion statement
 
02:49:29.429 --> 02:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
is synonymous with discrimination I just
 
02:49:33.550 --> 02:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
don't even know how that is
 
02:49:35.710 --> 02:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
possible other
 
02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%

that have signed on to to a series of
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
policy principles which outline the
 
02:50:49.750 --> 02:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
benefits of investing in clean energy
 
02:50:53.950 --> 02:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
and uh Energy Efficiency um we share the
 
02:50:56.190 --> 02:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
concerns of uh the Bia and others who
 
02:50:58.510 --> 02:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
have spoken that uh the provisions in
 
02:51:00.670 --> 02:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
this bill that address diversity equity
 
02:51:03.469 --> 02:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
and inclusion statements are misplaced
 
02:51:06.269 --> 02:51:06.279 align:start position:0%
um it seems to equate that activity
 
02:51:09.269 --> 02:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
which is incredibly common uh in
 
02:51:10.830 --> 02:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire and and
 
02:51:13.190 --> 02:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
across the country to have diversity
 
02:51:14.990 --> 02:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
Equity inclusion statements as somehow
 
02:51:18.070 --> 02:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
being unlawfully discriminatory when in
 
02:51:20.229 --> 02:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
fact those who adopt them probably see
 
02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
it as the opposite um and so it's for
 
02:51:25.349 --> 02:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
those reasons that siries opposes House
 
02:51:25.359 --> 02:51:26.630 align:start position:0%
those reasons that siries opposes House
Bill

Bill
 
02:51:29.269 --> 02:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
1564 um an act relative to government
 
02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
purchasing that would prevent the state
 
02:51:33.110 --> 02:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
from Contracting with businesses that
 
02:51:35.710 --> 02:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
devop adopt diversity equity and

02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
act thei policy not only because it's a
 
02:51:42.269 --> 02:51:42.279 align:start position:0%
moral imperative to create more

02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
with Dei teams um uh were 22% more
 
02:52:06.429 --> 02:52:06.439 align:start position:0%
likely to be seen as an industry-leading
 
02:52:10.830 --> 02:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
company with high high caliber uh Talent
 
02:52:13.070 --> 02:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh we'd also add an an echo from a
 
02:52:16.469 --> 02:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
procurement p uh um uh provision that
 
02:52:20.110 --> 02:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
adopting uh this this provision and the
 
02:52:22.710 --> 02:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
prohibition on companies participating
 
02:52:24.309 --> 02:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
and purchasing the state county and
 
02:52:27.309 --> 02:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
local level that have de Dei statements
 
02:52:29.750 --> 02:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
would probably be quite costly uh to
 
02:52:31.870 --> 02:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
government New Hampshire because it will
 
02:52:34.389 --> 02:52:34.399 align:start position:0%
greatly diminish the number of uh folks
 
02:52:38.510 --> 02:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
that bid um on uh on rfps and
 
02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities to do business with the
 
02:52:41.870 --> 02:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
state um I'll leave with that I'll
 
02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you all might have
 
02:52:45.070 --> 02:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
but as I said the testimony we're
 
02:52:46.590 --> 02:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
passing out and which will be sent to
 
02:52:49.150 --> 02:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
you electronically does include links to
 
02:52:51.150 --> 02:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
additional information about series and
 
02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
our policy
 
02:52:59.150 --> 02:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
questions no there were not enough
 
02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
copies for the entire committee I
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
thought I had passed in 22 copies but I
 
02:53:07.389 --> 02:53:07.399 align:start position:0%
was certainly happy to get them to you
 
02:53:10.510 --> 02:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank you okay we would appreciate
 
02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
it okay Kate
 
02:53:13.359 --> 02:53:25.790 align:start position:0%
it okay Kate
Horgan

02:53:25.790 --> 02:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:27.269 --> 02:53:27.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my name is Kate
 
02:53:29.309 --> 02:53:29.319 align:start position:0%
Horan I'm here behalf on today of the
 
02:53:31.229 --> 02:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of counties
 
02:53:34.150 --> 02:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
the association does oppose this bill uh
 
02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
and representative Shu hit it right on
 
02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
the head we have no idea how we would
 
02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
possibly verify all of the contractors
 
02:53:46.670 --> 02:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
and uh employer purchasing uh agreements
 
02:53:49.389 --> 02:53:49.399 align:start position:0%
that we we purchase from this would
 
02:53:52.590 --> 02:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate platforms like Amazon because
 
02:53:54.510 --> 02:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
Amazon is its own company and sells its
 
02:53:58.429 --> 02:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
own stuff but individual sellers also
 
02:54:01.150 --> 02:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
participate in that platform and so
 
02:54:04.950 --> 02:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
while Amazon may qualify under this new
 
02:54:07.229 --> 02:54:07.239 align:start position:0%
bill as proposed some of the sellers may
 
02:54:09.630 --> 02:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
not and we may or may not be able to get
 
02:54:12.750 --> 02:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
a hold of those sellers to verify and if
 
02:54:14.710 --> 02:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
we even if we are able to the amount of
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
time that that would take would
 
02:54:18.269 --> 02:54:18.279 align:start position:0%
drastically slow down purchasing at the
 
02:54:20.229 --> 02:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
County government level um I will leave
 
02:54:22.469 --> 02:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
it at that we agree with uh both Mr
 
02:54:25.309 --> 02:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
Monahan Mr ju's positions um but I'm
 
02:54:26.990 --> 02:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions from the
 
02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:30.190 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions from the
committee

02:54:30.190 --> 02:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:32.910 --> 02:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
okay I don't see any thank you very much
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.279 --> 02:54:46.190 align:start position:0%
 
heck

02:54:46.190 --> 02:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
heck
 
02:54:48.150 --> 02:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Maguire and
 
02:54:49.630 --> 02:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:54:50.990 --> 02:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Katherine heck and I
 
02:54:52.710 --> 02:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:54:55.870 --> 02:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
Association and the 234 cities and towns
 
02:54:59.349 --> 02:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um we oppose this bill
 
02:55:01.229 --> 02:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
and while we certainly agree that
 
02:55:03.070 --> 02:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination has no place in in
 
02:55:05.950 --> 02:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
contract and purchasing we are deeply
 
02:55:08.469 --> 02:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
concerned on page two starting with line
 
02:55:11.110 --> 02:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
19 the prohibitions around cities towns
 
02:55:13.150 --> 02:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
and unincorporated places how we would
 
02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
in fact comply with the legislation we
 
02:55:17.349 --> 02:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
do not have the
 
02:55:19.950 --> 02:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
information required to evaluate a
 
02:55:22.830 --> 02:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
company the criteria is not quite clear
 
02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
to us on what that would look like and
 
02:55:26.510 --> 02:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
for example the federal government
 
02:55:29.630 --> 02:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
maintains a database of excluded parties
 
02:55:31.070 --> 02:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
which would include any company or
 
02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
contractor disbarred from doing business
 
02:55:34.750 --> 02:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
with the federal government so in the
 
02:55:37.070 --> 02:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
absence of a tool like that when you
 
02:55:38.870 --> 02:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
receive a Federal grant you're required
 
02:55:41.469 --> 02:55:41.479 align:start position:0%
to look up if anyone you're Contracting
 
02:55:44.190 --> 02:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
with has been suspended or disbarred BAS
 
02:55:45.870 --> 02:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
based on criteria set forth by the
 
02:55:48.510 --> 02:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
federal government um we would not be
 
02:55:51.550 --> 02:55:51.560 align:start position:0%
able to necessarily comply with this law
 
02:55:54.110 --> 02:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
is written I did want to add that it was
 
02:55:57.030 --> 02:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
discussed about rfps and bidding um on
 
02:55:59.510 --> 02:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
another bill that we were working on
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
looking at Architects and engineers and
 
02:56:04.990 --> 02:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
contractors we have um gathered data to
 
02:56:09.030 --> 02:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
support that last year we received on
 
02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:10.150 align:start position:0%
support that last year we received on
average

02:56:10.150 --> 02:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
average
 
02:56:14.229 --> 02:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
1.5 bids per project for facilities and
 
02:56:15.870 --> 02:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
facility infrastructure that we were
 
02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do on the municipal level in
 
02:56:21.870 --> 02:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
2018 we were receiving 3.86 bids per
 
02:56:24.389 --> 02:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
project so a bill like this could
 
02:56:27.429 --> 02:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
seriously um impact our ability to move
 
02:56:30.590 --> 02:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
forward um local projects but again if
 
02:56:32.469 --> 02:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
there was some type of clearing house
 
02:56:34.269 --> 02:56:34.279 align:start position:0%
that was very clear on what the state
 
02:56:36.990 --> 02:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
requirements were and companies were
 
02:56:40.110 --> 02:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
prev vetted that might assist us in our
 
02:56:42.110 --> 02:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
ability to comply with this type of
 
02:56:44.150 --> 02:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and that's all I have unless
 
02:56:45.229 --> 02:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
there's any
 
02:56:47.510 --> 02:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you very much are
 
02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:49.349 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you very much are
there

02:56:49.349 --> 02:56:49.359 align:start position:0%

02:56:58.110 --> 02:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:01.070 --> 02:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
1546 okay seeing none I will close the
 
02:57:04.269 --> 02:57:04.279 align:start position:0%

1:15

02:57:43.000 --> 03:03:42.469 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:15:41.399 --> 03:20:10.950 align:start position:0%

hm

04:16:37.870 --> 04:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
hm
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
all right good afternoon welcome back I
 
04:16:42.790 --> 04:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
have a request for those people who use
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%

a can of soda and a bottle of water
 
04:17:00.870 --> 04:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.309 --> 04:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:08.429 --> 04:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
they all right
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
so our representative
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam chair uh for
 
04:17:15.910 --> 04:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Gary Merchant
 
04:17:17.070 --> 04:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
representative Gary Merchant
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
representing civan County district 6
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
which is Claremont in cyen New Hampshire
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here today representing both myself
 
04:17:27.149 --> 04:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
as a representative as a sponsor of this
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
bill the prime sponsor as well as the
 
04:17:30.030 --> 04:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
chair of the prescription duug
 
04:17:32.630 --> 04:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
affordability board so I'm not going to
 
04:17:35.149 --> 04:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
read my testimony um I think that could
 
04:17:38.149 --> 04:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
be done uh you folks can do that clearly
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
on your own but basically speak to the
 
04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
to the bill and reason them
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
here in House Bill 2 last year there was
 
04:17:51.950 --> 04:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
an inserted some changes to RSA 126 BB
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
which governs the board and one of those
 
04:17:57.790 --> 04:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
changes was to limit the executive
 
04:18:01.870 --> 04:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
director to two years after the date of
 
04:18:05.469 --> 04:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
H and the other one was that which I
 
04:18:07.469 --> 04:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
believe is unprecedented
 
04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
that a contract that the board
 
04:18:13.429 --> 04:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
has has to go to fiscal as well as the
 
04:18:16.189 --> 04:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
governor and counsel I have not found
 
04:18:18.670 --> 04:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the state that that
 
04:18:20.710 --> 04:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
requirement is
 
04:18:23.550 --> 04:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
required so my concern is by passing
 
04:18:26.309 --> 04:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
this bill and putting that language in
 
04:18:26.319 --> 04:18:26.950 align:start position:0%
this bill and putting that language in
the

04:18:26.950 --> 04:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:29.429 --> 04:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
RSA we're setting a
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
precedent and I think anytime we're
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
setting a precedent we should be very
 
04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
careful how we set
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
it I think it's somewh way Overkill I
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
think the Govern and Council does a
 
04:18:43.109 --> 04:18:43.119 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job looking at contracts I
 
04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
think that's where it should reside not
 
04:18:47.469 --> 04:18:47.479 align:start position:0%
going to both fiscal as well as the
 
04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
governor and councel it's redundant and
 
04:18:53.790 --> 04:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know the need for it the other
 
04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
one is a two-year limitation and that
 
04:18:58.830 --> 04:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
was there because there's an
 
04:19:01.309 --> 04:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
04:19:03.389 --> 04:19:03.399 align:start position:0%
redundancy there was an issue about the
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
redundancy between the board and the
 
04:19:07.630 --> 04:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance the insurance
 
04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
department that study is being done it's
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
ongoing however that will not be known
 
04:19:16.030 --> 04:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
to us in that report until sometime in
 
04:19:17.950 --> 04:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
October or November of this
 
04:19:21.750 --> 04:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
year being a legislative body as it is
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking for is not
 
04:19:27.950 --> 04:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the 2-year restriction but
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
to expand it to four years to allow the
 
04:19:32.670 --> 04:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
legislative process time to work through
 
04:19:35.670 --> 04:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
the process and do it appropriately and
 
04:19:35.680 --> 04:19:37.189 align:start position:0%
the process and do it appropriately and
correctly

04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
and not force ourselves into a situation
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
both the board and the legislative body
 
04:19:43.870 --> 04:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
to rush through something that it
 
04:19:45.149 --> 04:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't
 
04:19:48.510 --> 04:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
do so therefore the two elements in the
 
04:19:52.950 --> 04:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
bill is to modify RSA 126
 
04:19:57.189 --> 04:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
BB to extend the two years to four
 
04:19:59.349 --> 04:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
years to
 
04:20:02.070 --> 04:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
delete the requirement the redundancy
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
between the board with contracts in
 
04:20:08.189 --> 04:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal and governor and Council and by
 
04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
the way this bill has the full support
 
04:20:14.349 --> 04:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
of the board including representative
 
04:20:16.429 --> 04:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
Edwards who was on the meeting uh it's
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
on tape you can see it so he supported
 
04:20:21.550 --> 04:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
the bill during the
 
04:20:25.030 --> 04:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
meeting and I'm just saying the board as
 
04:20:27.189 --> 04:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
collectively is also in support of the
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill they're not trying to
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate the time limit if you will
 
04:20:35.870 --> 04:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing we have to get the report on
 
04:20:37.389 --> 04:20:37.399 align:start position:0%
redundancy and then we have to be able
 
04:20:39.070 --> 04:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
to act on it all we're asking this
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee to do and the legislative body
 
04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
to do was provide a reasonable period of
 
04:20:46.710 --> 04:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
time to act on whatever the
 
04:20:49.550 --> 04:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations are from that study and
 
04:20:51.870 --> 04:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
then at the same time eliminate what I
 
04:20:55.830 --> 04:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
think is potentially a precedent that we
 
04:20:59.229 --> 04:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:02.750 --> 04:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
set thank you are there any
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:21:09.149 --> 04:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
do thank you madam chair um it may sound
 
04:21:12.429 --> 04:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
like an odd question but in this in this
 
04:21:15.910 --> 04:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
two-year U cycle does the executive
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
director have to
 
04:21:21.229 --> 04:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
campaign um for the reappointment or is
 
04:21:25.269 --> 04:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
it U you know what's the method of of
 
04:21:25.279 --> 04:21:26.710 align:start position:0%
it U you know what's the method of of
getting

04:21:26.710 --> 04:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
getting
 
04:21:29.309 --> 04:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
reappointed there the method of
 
04:21:31.349 --> 04:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
reappointment basically they're hired by
 
04:21:33.469 --> 04:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
the board so they become a state
 
04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
employee they're not basically um um a
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
political entity they don't they're not
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
elected if you will so at that point in
 
04:21:44.030 --> 04:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
time if after two years if we don't pass
 
04:21:46.269 --> 04:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
the bill and to extend it then their
 
04:21:49.750 --> 04:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
employment becomes non-employed now they
 
04:21:51.469 --> 04:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
can't have a job the job
 
04:21:55.229 --> 04:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
disappears so thank
 
04:21:58.670 --> 04:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
you Simon thank you madam chair uh I may
 
04:22:01.710 --> 04:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
have missed it in your testimony but uh
 
04:22:03.429 --> 04:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
the two-year cycle for the executive
 
04:22:05.790 --> 04:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
director where are we at in that cycle
 
04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
good question represent Simon right now
 
04:22:11.309 --> 04:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
the way the law was written is two years
 
04:22:13.510 --> 04:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
from the date of hire the executive
 
04:22:16.269 --> 04:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
director has been hired his name is Kurt
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
Williamson he begins on January 29th so
 
04:22:21.910 --> 04:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
the two years starts from January 29th
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
of this year follow up follow up so if
 
04:22:29.070 --> 04:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
you have a full two years you said the
 
04:22:31.830 --> 04:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
um the report is coming out in October
 
04:22:34.149 --> 04:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
um what do you foresee that would
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
require an extra two years of on top of
 
04:22:38.030 --> 04:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
the year and a quarter that you would
 
04:22:40.269 --> 04:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
have to review and make your changes
 
04:22:43.630 --> 04:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
it's the legislative calendar um my
 
04:22:45.030 --> 04:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is that if the report
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
comes out in say beginning of
 
04:22:50.910 --> 04:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
November the dates in which we have to
 
04:22:54.790 --> 04:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
file legislation is relatively narrow so
 
04:22:57.790 --> 04:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
what will happen is we'll get the report
 
04:22:59.469 --> 04:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
someone's got to look at the report make
 
04:23:02.910 --> 04:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
the decision to support another bill but
 
04:23:04.510 --> 04:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
we'll most likely miss that window in
 
04:23:06.429 --> 04:23:06.439 align:start position:0%
November which means we have to wait
 
04:23:08.189 --> 04:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
another full year before we can take
 
04:23:12.109 --> 04:23:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:16.950 --> 04:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
you any others represent leus thank you
 
04:23:18.269 --> 04:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
um it's been a while since I've looked
 
04:23:21.910 --> 04:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
at this but as I recall at least as the
 
04:23:23.870 --> 04:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
statute read I don't know if it's
 
04:23:27.510 --> 04:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
changed that um money would come to the
 
04:23:31.349 --> 04:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
board through um certain fees and and
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
other things charged to I think a
 
04:23:36.389 --> 04:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
variety of organizations that you know
 
04:23:38.830 --> 04:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured distributed all that sort
 
04:23:41.469 --> 04:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
of thing um and if that's correct and
 
04:23:43.870 --> 04:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
that money comes directly to the board
 
04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
and the board could spend it I could see
 
04:23:47.750 --> 04:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
a I'm just talking about section two
 
04:23:50.550 --> 04:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
would there be a uh kind of a difference
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
between what's going on with the board
 
04:23:54.349 --> 04:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
and certain other things where the board
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
would be taking in money and spending it
 
04:23:59.189 --> 04:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
without any kind of legislative approval
 
04:24:01.950 --> 04:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
and then I could see um you know going
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
to the uh fiscal committee and general
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
court is kind of um you know a way to at
 
04:24:08.910 --> 04:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
least include some legislative oversight
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
of spending so it doesn't seem to be
 
04:24:14.269 --> 04:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
quite the same as everything else right
 
04:24:15.910 --> 04:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question M represent
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
leas um in House Bill two we eliminated
 
04:24:22.349 --> 04:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
that completely so in other words the
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
board is completely dependent upon State
 
04:24:27.510 --> 04:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
funds there's no fees that the board
 
04:24:32.389 --> 04:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
assesses um so right now in House Bill 2
 
04:24:35.109 --> 04:24:35.119 align:start position:0%
it's fully supportive out of the state
 
04:24:37.189 --> 04:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
general Treasury
 
04:24:39.870 --> 04:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
which does have legislative oversight it
 
04:24:42.790 --> 04:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
goes to a budget committee review and it
 
04:24:44.229 --> 04:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
goes to a legislative review so the
 
04:24:47.030 --> 04:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
board finances are in fact controlled by
 
04:24:50.189 --> 04:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
the legislative body um followup follow
 
04:24:52.269 --> 04:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
up yeah I'm just trying to skim through
 
04:24:53.950 --> 04:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
it looks like there are some fees are
 
04:24:55.429 --> 04:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
there still fees and if so do they just
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
go to the general fund or how's that
 
04:24:59.389 --> 04:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
work I'm not aware of anywhere there's
 
04:25:01.269 --> 04:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
any fees those fees were
 
04:25:03.429 --> 04:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
eliminated um just quick follow I mean
 
04:25:05.670 --> 04:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at what's in uh on gen Court
 
04:25:07.309 --> 04:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
under r I don't know if it hasn't been
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
updated it may not be updated I can get
 
04:25:12.070 --> 04:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
you a current version of the uh RSA if
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
you'd like I'd appreciate that if you
 
04:25:16.149 --> 04:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
would but the uh to your point in House
 
04:25:20.189 --> 04:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
Bill two um House Bill two eliminated
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
all the fees because they're considered
 
04:25:22.830 --> 04:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
to be quote
 
04:25:24.990 --> 04:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um and at that point in
 
04:25:26.910 --> 04:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
time we went to the general court and
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
the legislative body elected to put
 
04:25:31.349 --> 04:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
money in the budget through the
 
04:25:33.950 --> 04:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
legislative process to the financial and
 
04:25:35.149 --> 04:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
that that's how the board support it
 
04:25:37.309 --> 04:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
today thank because i' had a concern
 
04:25:38.910 --> 04:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
about that when it came before us before
 
04:25:38.920 --> 04:25:39.670 align:start position:0%
about that when it came before us before
thank

04:25:39.670 --> 04:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:25:39.680 --> 04:25:41.710 align:start position:0%
thank
you

04:25:41.710 --> 04:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative sh it thank you
 
04:25:48.429 --> 04:25:48.439 align:start position:0%
madam chair um looking at the RSA and I
 
04:25:52.950 --> 04:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
don't see any kind of direction if you
 
04:25:55.830 --> 04:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
go to fiscal committee and they approve
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
and then the governor and Council
 
04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
disapproves if there's a conflict
 
04:26:02.469 --> 04:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
between those two uh it looks like
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
there's no guidance as to what you would
 
04:26:07.469 --> 04:26:07.479 align:start position:0%
do have you encountered anything like
 
04:26:09.910 --> 04:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
that in the brief period of time that
 
04:26:11.429 --> 04:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
this has been
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
in thank you for the question um
 
04:26:17.229 --> 04:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
representative in a brief period of time
 
04:26:20.870 --> 04:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
I let me say this we have not had any
 
04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
real activity with the board until just
 
04:26:24.510 --> 04:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
recently because we had to wait for the
 
04:26:28.269 --> 04:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
funding to occur um we have anou with
 
04:26:29.630 --> 04:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health Human Services
 
04:26:31.070 --> 04:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
because we're administrative attached to
 
04:26:33.229 --> 04:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
them but as far as at this point in time
 
04:26:35.349 --> 04:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
we have not had any issue per se because
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
we had never had a reason for a contract
 
04:26:40.030 --> 04:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
so to be
 
04:26:43.950 --> 04:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
seen okay interesting thank you very
 
04:26:46.469 --> 04:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
much oh excuse me representative Schmid
 
04:26:47.830 --> 04:26:47.840 align:start position:0%

has this kind of a funding uh structure
 
04:27:04.590 --> 04:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
where it's the fiscal committee and the
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%

made a thorough search I take
 
04:27:29.070 --> 04:27:29.080 align:start position:0%

a um to be quite candid I'm a little
 
04:28:35.319 --> 04:28:36.750 align:start position:0%
a um to be quite candid I'm a little
puzzled

04:28:36.750 --> 04:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
puzzled
 
04:28:38.349 --> 04:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
uh that this bill was
 
04:28:41.550 --> 04:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
introduced um representative Jess
 
04:28:44.910 --> 04:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
Edwards and I have been following the U
 
04:28:47.469 --> 04:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
drug uh pres prescription drug
 
04:28:50.149 --> 04:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
affordability board for some time this
 
04:28:52.630 --> 04:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
board has appeared before fisal for
 
04:28:56.269 --> 04:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
requests uh money requests um issues
 
04:28:59.550 --> 04:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with rules and the the fiscal
 
04:29:01.790 --> 04:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
committee has tabled a number of their
 
04:29:03.870 --> 04:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
requests until some of these questions
 
04:29:06.510 --> 04:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
had been answered the Lang which you see
 
04:29:10.590 --> 04:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
in the bill dealing with the section
 
04:29:15.429 --> 04:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
126 BB colon 11 was specifically added
 
04:29:18.070 --> 04:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
by uh representative Edwards into the
 
04:29:20.429 --> 04:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
budget found on page
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
102 uh this was because of the concerns
 
04:29:26.469 --> 04:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
that we had on the finance committee and
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee um I do serve on
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
the finance committee and I also serve
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
on the joint legislative fiscal
 
04:29:34.790 --> 04:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
committee and for those of you that may
 
04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
not be familiar with with the joint
 
04:29:38.670 --> 04:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee there are
 
04:29:41.229 --> 04:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
five senators and five house members
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
that look at spending requests or
 
04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
departments that may run out of money
 
04:29:48.030 --> 04:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
and we accept uh requests for funding
 
04:29:49.870 --> 04:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
Federal funding comes through us and we
 
04:29:51.990 --> 04:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
meet generally once a
 
04:29:55.910 --> 04:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
month so I'm again a little puzzled um
 
04:29:58.030 --> 04:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
with the earlier testimony because I've
 
04:30:02.109 --> 04:30:02.119 align:start position:0%
been texting representative Edwards and
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
uh he is not in favor of the restrict
 
04:30:08.550 --> 04:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
removing the section that takes a joint
 
04:30:11.469 --> 04:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee out of this
 
04:30:15.429 --> 04:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
review and to representative leak's
 
04:30:18.830 --> 04:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh we also felt in the finance
 
04:30:21.550 --> 04:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
committee being a new board that has the
 
04:30:23.710 --> 04:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
ability to spend an awful lot of money
 
04:30:25.670 --> 04:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps it should still have some
 
04:30:28.830 --> 04:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight thank
 
04:30:31.990 --> 04:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
you excuse me represent leis do you have
 
04:30:34.469 --> 04:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
any question any concerns with the
 
04:30:36.389 --> 04:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
four-year term rather than the twoyear
 
04:30:40.910 --> 04:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
term for the director or I personally do
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
not thank you are there any other
 
04:30:45.269 --> 04:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair I'll I'll ask
 
04:30:50.830 --> 04:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
the same question that I asked uh
 
04:30:53.109 --> 04:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant what will the
 
04:30:55.149 --> 04:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
what should the board do if there's a
 
04:30:58.750 --> 04:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
conflict between fiscals approval and
 
04:31:00.710 --> 04:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
say the governor and Council
 
04:31:04.189 --> 04:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
disapproval how how do they resolve that
 
04:31:07.109 --> 04:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
generally um a number of issues come
 
04:31:09.109 --> 04:31:09.119 align:start position:0%
through fiscal first before they go to
 
04:31:11.189 --> 04:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
governor and councel so it wouldn't be
 
04:31:12.910 --> 04:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
like governor and Council approving and
 
04:31:16.469 --> 04:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
then coming to fiscal the general way of
 
04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh things move from fiscal is from
 
04:31:20.590 --> 04:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal to the governor and Council and
 
04:31:22.189 --> 04:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
if we don't approve it it doesn't go to
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
governor and councel okay what about if
 
04:31:26.830 --> 04:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
you approve it and they say no I don't
 
04:31:29.950 --> 04:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
see any remedy to resolve that
 
04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
difference well if the fiscal committee
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
was taken out of it um it would just go
 
04:31:36.189 --> 04:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
straight to government and Council
 
04:31:38.790 --> 04:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
there'd be no legislative oversight
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um followup my point though
 
04:31:44.910 --> 04:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
is um should there be something built
 
04:31:46.710 --> 04:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
into this as to a
 
04:31:50.429 --> 04:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
remedy I think um representative Shu the
 
04:31:53.910 --> 04:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
way it is now is sufficient works well
 
04:31:56.229 --> 04:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
or we haven't had a problem with it yet
 
04:31:58.229 --> 04:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
and again this language was established
 
04:32:00.510 --> 04:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 just a little more than
 
04:32:03.070 --> 04:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
six months ago and hasn't had a chance
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
to even go through the process thank you
 
04:32:08.990 --> 04:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
the questions represent black if I may
 
04:32:11.149 --> 04:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
it's not a question but it's a response
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
there there's a number of cases where a
 
04:32:14.550 --> 04:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
legislative committee deals with
 
04:32:15.870 --> 04:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
something then it goes to governor and
 
04:32:18.309 --> 04:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
councel for example
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
jcec um can approve certain things we
 
04:32:22.710 --> 04:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
approve then it goes to governor and
 
04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
counsel um and in that case I mean if
 
04:32:26.830 --> 04:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
the committee approves it and the
 
04:32:29.070 --> 04:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
governor and councel don't then it stops
 
04:32:31.309 --> 04:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
it's an it's it has to pass every step
 
04:32:33.630 --> 04:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
there's no conflict
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
really yeah good the governor and
 
04:32:38.590 --> 04:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
Council has different priorities and
 
04:32:42.109 --> 04:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
different criteria than the legislator
 
04:32:43.389 --> 04:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
in some
 
04:32:46.229 --> 04:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
cases okay anyone
 
04:32:48.109 --> 04:32:48.119 align:start position:0%
else all right thank you for your
 
04:32:49.870 --> 04:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
testimony thanks Madam chair and thanks
 
04:32:49.880 --> 04:32:51.510 align:start position:0%
testimony thanks Madam chair and thanks
the

04:32:51.510 --> 04:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:53.830 --> 04:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
committee is there anyone else who
 
04:32:57.590 --> 04:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify at House Bill
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
16001 all right seeing none close the
 
04:33:01.600 --> 04:33:02.830 align:start position:0%
16001 all right seeing none close the
public

04:33:02.830 --> 04:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
hearing and I think we will go into
 
04:33:05.879 --> 04:33:07.310 align:start position:0%
hearing and I think we will go into
executive

04:33:07.310 --> 04:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
executive
 
04:33:11.510 --> 04:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
session and discuss House Bill
 
04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:25.590 --> 04:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:28.029 --> 04:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
motion for your memory that was the one
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
lunch what's that representative gold
 
04:33:39.189 --> 04:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'd like to move to itl that
 
04:33:39.199 --> 04:33:40.590 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'd like to move to itl that
bill

04:33:40.590 --> 04:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:33:40.600 --> 04:33:42.789 align:start position:0%
bill
second

04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:33:46.590 --> 04:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
okay um itl by representative Gold
 
04:33:49.470 --> 04:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative
 
04:33:52.990 --> 04:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
Schmidt would you like to speak to your
 
04:33:57.150 --> 04:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
motion I just think that um as we heard
 
04:34:00.189 --> 04:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
in the testimony the bill would be very
 
04:34:01.869 --> 04:34:01.879 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
04:34:04.910 --> 04:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
monitor the definitions how do you even
 
04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
Define the kinds of things it just I and
 
04:34:11.629 --> 04:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
we heard that the activities that the
 
04:34:13.551 --> 04:34:13.561 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor seem to be concerned
 
04:34:16.029 --> 04:34:16.039 align:start position:0%
with which was illegality of
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
discrimination um is already against the
 
04:34:21.230 --> 04:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
law and so this seems redundant and I
 
04:34:22.830 --> 04:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
think that's about what I have to say
 
04:34:25.429 --> 04:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
about it representa Schmid do you to
 
04:34:27.269 --> 04:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
speak to your second thank you madam
 
04:34:31.789 --> 04:34:31.799 align:start position:0%
chair so the workability was heavily
 
04:34:36.070 --> 04:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
criticized um in in in the aggregate
 
04:34:40.269 --> 04:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
anyway uh by the by the people who spoke
 
04:34:43.269 --> 04:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
in opposition that was all a testimony
 
04:34:46.990 --> 04:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
except the sponsors um and and and I
 
04:34:51.109 --> 04:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
agree that it it this is also a solution
 
04:34:53.869 --> 04:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
in search of a problem so I happy to
 
04:34:55.070 --> 04:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
support the
 
04:34:58.029 --> 04:34:58.039 align:start position:0%
itl right any other comments
 
04:35:00.429 --> 04:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
representative leus I I agree with the
 
04:35:03.750 --> 04:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
itl um the problem is it's a problematic
 
04:35:05.590 --> 04:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
precedent I mean arguably almost
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
anything that's illegal that a vendor
 
04:35:09.390 --> 04:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
might do could more you know you could
 
04:35:11.629 --> 04:35:11.639 align:start position:0%
help enforcing it by making it part of
 
04:35:12.990 --> 04:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
the requirements part of the procurement
 
04:35:14.551 --> 04:35:14.561 align:start position:0%
process but that's not the right way to
 
04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
handle it in my
 
04:35:18.470 --> 04:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
view yes I
 
04:35:21.070 --> 04:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
would but based on this we could say
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
well if you've got any wage and ours
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
discrepancies we can't do business with
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
you and that would uh that would be
 
04:35:31.510 --> 04:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
problematic anyone
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
else comments questions concerns
 
04:35:39.189 --> 04:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
okay then the motion is inexpedient to
 
04:35:41.150 --> 04:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill
 
04:35:45.789 --> 04:35:45.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:48.590 --> 04:35:48.600 align:start position:0%

consent okay well you don't object to
 
04:36:54.750 --> 04:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
consent I think it we should put it
 
04:36:58.429 --> 04:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
there uh representative
 
04:37:03.109 --> 04:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
G uh I will lead your committee report
 
04:37:05.029 --> 04:37:05.039 align:start position:0%
at your earliest convenience and Absol

04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
motion okay I don't see any volunteers
 
04:37:52.510 --> 04:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
so what's that rep I I could make a
 
04:37:54.310 --> 04:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
motion on uh
 
04:37:57.869 --> 04:37:57.879 align:start position:0%
1454 if you want I'm not ready to make
 
04:38:01.949 --> 04:38:01.959 align:start position:0%
that okay you're not ready to do it okay
 
04:38:05.349 --> 04:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
fine all right in that case we will come
 
04:38:08.629 --> 04:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
out of executive session and our next
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.920 --> 04:45:33.270 align:start position:0%
 
p.m.

04:45:33.280 --> 04:52:32.628 align:start position:0%
 
for

04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:32.638 --> 05:00:32.548 align:start position:0%
 
for

05:00:32.548 --> 05:00:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:35.270 --> 05:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
all right welcome to Edna I'm opening
 
05:00:38.030 --> 05:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill 1486 and I
 
05:00:44.830 --> 05:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:47.510 --> 05:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
Gera thank you very much I'd like to CH
 
05:00:49.948 --> 05:00:49.958 align:start position:0%
thank the chair and the committee uh I
 
05:00:52.390 --> 05:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
am the primary sponsor of the bill but
 
05:00:54.190 --> 05:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to keep my introductory
 
05:00:57.670 --> 05:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
remarks very very brief because um we
 
05:01:00.510 --> 05:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
have a witness who just arrived he is uh
 
05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
he'll be back in here in a moment uh
 
05:01:03.868 --> 05:01:03.878 align:start position:0%
professor Charles wheen from from
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth who is the real person uh that
 
05:01:08.230 --> 05:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
I think you're going to want to ask your
 
05:01:11.430 --> 05:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
questions of uh and he has to leave by
 
05:01:14.270 --> 05:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
245 and drive straight back to Handover
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to keep my introductory
 
05:01:19.590 --> 05:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
remarks very very brief uh and then have
 
05:01:21.510 --> 05:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
Professor wheen come uh and talk to you
 
05:01:23.030 --> 05:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
and answer your
 
05:01:27.390 --> 05:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
questions this bill is to establish uh a
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
proxy carbon price for uh purchases uh
 
05:01:33.510 --> 05:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
by the the the state St we're talking
 
05:01:36.150 --> 05:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
about Renovations or the purchase of uh
 
05:01:38.830 --> 05:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
for example vehicles or other uh
 
05:01:41.230 --> 05:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
equipment that would involve carbon
 
05:01:43.510 --> 05:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
emissions it is a proxy price because we
 
05:01:46.110 --> 05:01:46.120 align:start position:0%
do not currently have a carbon price
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire or in the United
 
05:01:49.590 --> 05:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
States although as Witnesses who will
 
05:01:52.708 --> 05:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
follow me will discuss uh it is coming
 
05:01:55.310 --> 05:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
Canada has one the United sta or uh the
 
05:01:57.708 --> 05:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
European Union has one uh and we are
 
05:01:59.670 --> 05:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
going to be at a significant economic
 
05:02:01.590 --> 05:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
disadvantage if we do not also move in
 
05:02:03.070 --> 05:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
the direction of carbon prices think it
 
05:02:05.150 --> 05:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
will hurt our exports uh to those
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
countries uh those uh those
 
05:02:11.470 --> 05:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
markets uh this is a a situation I think
 
05:02:13.150 --> 05:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
where we can walk and chew gum at the
 
05:02:16.190 --> 05:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
same time we can reduce the burden on
 
05:02:19.030 --> 05:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and reduce carbon emissions at
 
05:02:23.270 --> 05:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
the same time uh markets are based on
 
05:02:26.788 --> 05:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
incentives uh absent incentives uh it is
 
05:02:28.150 --> 05:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
it is pretty close to the literal
 
05:02:30.270 --> 05:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
definition of insanity to believe that
 
05:02:32.830 --> 05:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
someone will uh in a market context
 
05:02:34.548 --> 05:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
change their behavior we have to have
 
05:02:37.990 --> 05:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
economic incentives uh and that is the
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
the policy makers who originally uh came
 
05:02:43.750 --> 05:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
up with this idea of carbon pricing uh
 
05:02:46.110 --> 05:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
were conservative market-driven policy
 
05:02:48.190 --> 05:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
makers uh who were trying to find an
 
05:02:51.948 --> 05:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
alternative to State driven models uh
 
05:02:53.830 --> 05:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
and so carbon pricing was about
 
05:02:56.310 --> 05:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
constructing a a market for
 
05:02:59.670 --> 05:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
carbon for carbon emissions the state of
 
05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is an agent is an actor in
 
05:03:06.628 --> 05:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
the market as we uh you know uh build
 
05:03:08.470 --> 05:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
buildings and renovate buildings HVAC
 
05:03:10.590 --> 05:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
systems and we produce or pardon me we
 
05:03:14.470 --> 05:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
um we consume vehicles and uh and other
 
05:03:14.480 --> 05:03:15.548 align:start position:0%
um we consume vehicles and uh and other
carbon

05:03:15.548 --> 05:03:15.558 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
05:03:15.558 --> 05:03:17.830 align:start position:0%
carbon
emitting

05:03:17.830 --> 05:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
emitting
 
05:03:21.310 --> 05:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh costs right uh that that the
 
05:03:23.548 --> 05:03:23.558 align:start position:0%
taxpayer has to pay for the purpose of
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is actually to be able to
 
05:03:28.230 --> 05:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
think about how the carbon Market will
 
05:03:31.350 --> 05:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
allow us to save money for taxpayers of
 
05:03:32.830 --> 05:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire thinking
 
05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
about uh how a carbon Market uh is
 
05:03:38.230 --> 05:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
functioning currently uh in the world
 
05:03:40.470 --> 05:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
and how it's likely to affect New
 
05:03:41.708 --> 05:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the United States in the
 
05:03:46.110 --> 05:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
coming years so that is the the very
 
05:03:48.628 --> 05:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
basic focus of the bill the intent of
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
the bill uh I believe that it's
 
05:03:52.548 --> 05:03:52.558 align:start position:0%
consistent with Our obligation to serve
 
05:03:54.910 --> 05:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
our constituents both financially
 
05:03:58.230 --> 05:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
economically uh and environmentally and
 
05:04:00.390 --> 05:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh professor wheen and some of our other
 
05:04:02.990 --> 05:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh guests here today will be able to
 
05:04:06.270 --> 05:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
give you uh some really good detail
 
05:04:08.948 --> 05:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
around how a carbon pricing system works
 
05:04:11.628 --> 05:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
and answer questions that you might
 
05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
have thank you I have a a
 
05:04:20.548 --> 05:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
question this doesn't the point of X
 
05:04:23.910 --> 05:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
dollar per ton doesn't make any sense to
 
05:04:26.548 --> 05:04:26.558 align:start position:0%
me when you're talking about buying a
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
car what how would you apply it well you
 
05:04:33.990 --> 05:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
would take a look at over the course of
 
05:04:36.030 --> 05:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
how long a state the state plans to have
 
05:04:38.590 --> 05:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
that car right how much carbon you are
 
05:04:41.628 --> 05:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
using to fuel that automobile the carbon
 
05:04:45.788 --> 05:04:45.798 align:start position:0%
price would affect uh the the price of
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
that car if it's factored into a carbon
 
05:04:50.788 --> 05:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
price is factored into the expense of
 
05:04:53.110 --> 05:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
operating that vehicle over its lifetime
 
05:04:56.990 --> 05:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
so you'd you'd have multiple assumptions
 
05:04:58.990 --> 05:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
on how long you're going to keep the car
 
05:05:00.470 --> 05:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
and what kind of mileage it's going to
 
05:05:02.948 --> 05:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
get and how many miles you drive it and
 
05:05:05.270 --> 05:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
then put a price on on the amount of gas
 
05:05:08.030 --> 05:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
consumed in the because of those yes
 
05:05:09.310 --> 05:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
that's correct I assume that when the
 
05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
state purchases vehicles for state
 
05:05:12.868 --> 05:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
employees for example to use these are
 
05:05:15.788 --> 05:05:15.798 align:start position:0%
all things that would be taken into
 
05:05:18.110 --> 05:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
account how long do we have the average
 
05:05:19.868 --> 05:05:19.878 align:start position:0%
vehicle in our Fleet how many miles is
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
it driven each year highway miles uh
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things are factored into
 
05:05:28.708 --> 05:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
the valuation of automobiles right so uh
 
05:05:31.030 --> 05:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
I don't see how that would be different
 
05:05:33.470 --> 05:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to a accessing carbon
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
have you verified that with the the
 
05:05:36.000 --> 05:05:37.628 align:start position:0%
have you verified that with the the
purchasing

05:05:37.628 --> 05:05:37.638 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
departments no they would have to write
 
05:05:42.910 --> 05:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
up the rules for how specifically they
 
05:05:44.948 --> 05:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
would account for that this bill is not
 
05:05:47.230 --> 05:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
an attempt to force upon them a
 
05:05:49.230 --> 05:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
particular accounting regime for that
 
05:05:52.030 --> 05:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
but uh they would need to be able to in
 
05:05:53.628 --> 05:05:53.638 align:start position:0%
order to implement this they're going to
 
05:05:55.708 --> 05:05:55.718 align:start position:0%
would have to to write new rules and the
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
rules would allow
 
05:06:00.990 --> 05:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
for accounting for those things um I'm
 
05:06:02.910 --> 05:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
glad you s of that but it's that's not
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
included in the bill you have to give
 
05:06:08.030 --> 05:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
them specific rule writing Authority in
 
05:06:11.150 --> 05:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
order to have them do that they don't do
 
05:06:11.160 --> 05:06:13.150 align:start position:0%
order to have them do that they don't do
it

05:06:13.150 --> 05:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:06:15.190 --> 05:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
automatically if I may ask a question I
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I did not know uh if if
 
05:06:20.910 --> 05:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
we are instructing them to include a new
 
05:06:25.030 --> 05:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
variable in their purchasing uh I had
 
05:06:27.708 --> 05:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
assumed that and obviously I'm wrong in
 
05:06:29.548 --> 05:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
this case I'd assume that that would by
 
05:06:32.708 --> 05:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
that would necessitate a rule to uh
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
allow them to incorporate a new
 
05:06:37.910 --> 05:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
accounting method but uh I I appreciate
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
the clarification I did not know that
 
05:06:43.708 --> 05:06:43.718 align:start position:0%
all right thank you um any anyone else
 
05:06:45.990 --> 05:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
have a
 
05:06:48.070 --> 05:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you very much for
 
05:06:55.948 --> 05:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:57.990 --> 05:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
weeland thank you for having me you have
 
05:06:59.628 --> 05:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
my written testimony so I'm Charlie
 
05:07:01.390 --> 05:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
wheen I've come down from dmouth I teach
 
05:07:03.990 --> 05:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
at the tuck School of business I was
 
05:07:05.430 --> 05:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
trained at the University of Chicago
 
05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
which will be relevant down the road
 
05:07:10.788 --> 05:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
because the key issue here is that and
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
one of the most important ideas in
 
05:07:14.830 --> 05:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
economics is that markets don't
 
05:07:17.030 --> 05:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily get things right when
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
there's some cost that the parties don't
 
05:07:22.390 --> 05:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
have to incur so classic example
 
05:07:24.868 --> 05:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
historically would be smoking neither
 
05:07:26.350 --> 05:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
the companies that produced the
 
05:07:27.868 --> 05:07:27.878 align:start position:0%
cigarettes nor the people who bought
 
05:07:30.270 --> 05:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
them bore the full cost or all kinds of
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
health care costs that were then borne
 
05:07:34.470 --> 05:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
by the State lead paint would be another
 
05:07:37.110 --> 05:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
example so the most important thing
 
05:07:39.750 --> 05:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
about this bill is that it would give
 
05:07:42.750 --> 05:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
the state the power to look at the real
 
05:07:45.110 --> 05:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
social cost of whatever they're
 
05:07:46.628 --> 05:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
purchasing and I thought your question
 
05:07:49.230 --> 05:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
was spoton but if you take a relatively
 
05:07:52.390 --> 05:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
simple example if you're comparing two
 
05:07:55.750 --> 05:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
snow plows and one of them is ostensibly
 
05:07:58.230 --> 05:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
cheaper but does a lot more damage to
 
05:08:00.110 --> 05:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
the roads than it would make sense for
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
DOT to look at a different snowplow
 
05:08:04.390 --> 05:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
that when they fully Incorporated the
 
05:08:07.190 --> 05:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
cost of repairs might be cheaper in the
 
05:08:09.990 --> 05:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
lifetime of the plow this goes one step
 
05:08:12.510 --> 05:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
further and says if you're making a
 
05:08:16.510 --> 05:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
procurement decision and one option
 
05:08:18.510 --> 05:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
involves a significant amount of carbon
 
05:08:20.948 --> 05:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
emissions that then do damage elsewhere
 
05:08:23.390 --> 05:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
in the state whether it's climate change
 
05:08:25.470 --> 05:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
related damage to the ski industry or
 
05:08:27.990 --> 05:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
erosion on the Sea Coast or health
 
05:08:30.190 --> 05:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
effects that are borne by the state that
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
in your purchasing decision you can
 
05:08:33.948 --> 05:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
incorporate those
 
05:08:36.430 --> 05:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
costs um you've got my written testimony
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
but just a couple of points I really
 
05:08:39.190 --> 05:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
want to make and then we can open it up
 
05:08:42.110 --> 05:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
for questions um the first is just this
 
05:08:44.750 --> 05:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
key idea that markets are a terrific and
 
05:08:46.948 --> 05:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
powerful thing but you do have to get
 
05:08:49.030 --> 05:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
the price right and when it comes to any
 
05:08:50.830 --> 05:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
kind of pollution water pollution air
 
05:08:53.548 --> 05:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
pollution carbon pollution congestion
 
05:08:56.390 --> 05:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
pollution if the people doing whatever
 
05:08:58.030 --> 05:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing don't feel that price
 
05:08:59.270 --> 05:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get the outcome
 
05:09:01.230 --> 05:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
that's best for everybody this is a
 
05:09:01.240 --> 05:09:02.948 align:start position:0%
that's best for everybody this is a
longstanding

05:09:02.948 --> 05:09:02.958 align:start position:0%
longstanding
 
05:09:04.470 --> 05:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
belief in economics and I mentioned the
 
05:09:06.590 --> 05:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
University of Chicago my dissertation
 
05:09:08.670 --> 05:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
adviser was Gary Becker his dissertation
 
05:09:11.310 --> 05:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
adviser was Milton fredman and both
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
fredman well I Freedman died I think
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
before it became relevant but Gary
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
Becker who is very much of the Chicago
 
05:09:18.910 --> 05:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
school was one of the earliest and most
 
05:09:20.910 --> 05:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
vocal proponents for putting some kind
 
05:09:23.230 --> 05:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
of price on carbon because he felt that
 
05:09:26.470 --> 05:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
markets didn't get it right second
 
05:09:28.590 --> 05:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
putting the cost of carbon in state
 
05:09:30.830 --> 05:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
procurement decisions is a fiscally
 
05:09:32.948 --> 05:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
responsible thing to do I mean we are
 
05:09:34.750 --> 05:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for the full cost of
 
05:09:37.470 --> 05:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
whatever we do so if buying a diesel
 
05:09:40.868 --> 05:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
truck seems cheap but has emissions
 
05:09:42.948 --> 05:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
consequences that are more expensive in
 
05:09:45.150 --> 05:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
the long run than an electric version
 
05:09:46.310 --> 05:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
then we ought to do the fiscally
 
05:09:47.830 --> 05:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
responsible thing which is to take into
 
05:09:49.830 --> 05:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
account that pollution and opt for the
 
05:09:52.788 --> 05:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
second thing you mentioned the price and
 
05:09:54.910 --> 05:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
I have to say I'm agnostic on what the
 
05:09:58.070 --> 05:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
right price per ton of carbon is it's a
 
05:10:00.510 --> 05:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
very complicated thing to calculate and
 
05:10:02.110 --> 05:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
you have to decide whether you want to
 
05:10:03.708 --> 05:10:03.718 align:start position:0%
think about just the carbon emissions as
 
05:10:05.310 --> 05:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
they affect New Hampshire or whether
 
05:10:07.350 --> 05:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
it's New England or whether it's Global
 
05:10:09.390 --> 05:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
carbon but one thing I can say
 
05:10:11.110 --> 05:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
unequivocally which is why I was eager
 
05:10:13.750 --> 05:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
to come down here is the correct price
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
for a ton of carbon emissions is not
 
05:10:18.510 --> 05:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
zero there are significant costs that
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
have to be incorporated and that's
 
05:10:22.270 --> 05:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
something you can give rule making
 
05:10:23.510 --> 05:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
authority to someone who has more
 
05:10:26.548 --> 05:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
expertise around that uh and then last I
 
05:10:29.470 --> 05:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
see this bill as a step in the right
 
05:10:31.868 --> 05:10:31.878 align:start position:0%
direction as the representative alluded
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
to to in in his opening remarks ideally
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
we would like to get to a place where
 
05:10:39.990 --> 05:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
all of our Behavior takes into account
 
05:10:42.230 --> 05:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
all of the costs that we impose on
 
05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
whatever parties might be that uh and
 
05:10:47.628 --> 05:10:47.638 align:start position:0%
this is both to make markets work better
 
05:10:48.990 --> 05:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
so that you take the Full Count of your
 
05:10:50.670 --> 05:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
behavior into account and don't do
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
things that impose costs on other people
 
05:10:55.230 --> 05:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
but not yourself but also I would say
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
and consistent with this my comments
 
05:10:59.350 --> 05:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
about the University of Chicago it is a
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
more efficient way to manage carbon
 
05:11:04.868 --> 05:11:04.878 align:start position:0%
pollution or any kind of pollution than
 
05:11:07.030 --> 05:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
trying to regulate it away so to use an
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
example if I put a price on power that
 
05:11:13.750 --> 05:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
comes from a polluting source and then
 
05:11:17.190 --> 05:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
just step back then every facet of our
 
05:11:20.470 --> 05:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
Behavior will now take into account the
 
05:11:22.948 --> 05:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
true social cost of that power so you
 
05:11:24.788 --> 05:11:24.798 align:start position:0%
know I may insulate my attic because my
 
05:11:26.390 --> 05:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
electricity is more expensive I might
 
05:11:27.708 --> 05:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
choose to buy a different car I might
 
05:11:29.830 --> 05:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
drive less I might buy products with
 
05:11:32.830 --> 05:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
less packaging that all follows s
 
05:11:36.150 --> 05:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
through Market mechanisms because I've
 
05:11:38.150 --> 05:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
correctly priced or more correctly
 
05:11:40.948 --> 05:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
priced carbon the alternative if you
 
05:11:42.910 --> 05:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
believe in managing pollution is I'm
 
05:11:45.470 --> 05:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
going to regulate the insul insulation
 
05:11:47.230 --> 05:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
in your attic I'm going to regulate your
 
05:11:48.868 --> 05:11:48.878 align:start position:0%
vehicle I'm going to tell you not to
 
05:11:51.350 --> 05:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
drive less those are all more intrusive
 
05:11:52.990 --> 05:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
less efficient ways of getting to the
 
05:11:54.548 --> 05:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
same place which is pricing the
 
05:11:58.110 --> 05:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
pollution properly so back to this bill
 
05:11:59.990 --> 05:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
an important First Step would be in when
 
05:12:01.948 --> 05:12:01.958 align:start position:0%
you're making decisions with taxpayers
 
05:12:04.590 --> 05:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
money make them in a way that is
 
05:12:06.868 --> 05:12:06.878 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible for the entire
 
05:12:08.670 --> 05:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
State taking into account the burdens
 
05:12:11.150 --> 05:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
placed on everybody for the duration of
 
05:12:13.070 --> 05:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that you're procuring so
 
05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
I will stop there's a it's a fairly
 
05:12:16.948 --> 05:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
simple concept and but one that's quite
 
05:12:18.708 --> 05:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
complicated at the same time so I'd be
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:29.070 --> 05:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
questions if I can formulate
 
05:12:30.750 --> 05:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative Simon if I can formulate
 
05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
it quickly enough um just trying to wrap
 
05:12:37.230 --> 05:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
my head around uh kind of this like you
 
05:12:39.230 --> 05:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
said Simplicity but complexity of the
 
05:12:42.110 --> 05:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
the statements that you just made so we
 
05:12:45.150 --> 05:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
are fixing a very real dollar amount to
 
05:12:48.110 --> 05:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
very tangible assets at the state level
 
05:12:49.868 --> 05:12:49.878 align:start position:0%
while trying to take into
 
05:12:52.230 --> 05:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
consideration they have to be correlated
 
05:12:54.990 --> 05:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
in some way correct to real Damage Done
 
05:12:57.830 --> 05:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
correct somewhere else right but without
 
05:13:02.190 --> 05:13:02.200 align:start position:0%
a real mechanism to weigh that cost like
 
05:13:03.470 --> 05:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned erosion of the
 
05:13:05.868 --> 05:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
shoreline how do you how do you cost
 
05:13:09.390 --> 05:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
that in a way because on the one hand
 
05:13:12.110 --> 05:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
the state is incurring a burden right
 
05:13:14.350 --> 05:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
it's incurring a financial burden on the
 
05:13:16.230 --> 05:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
other hand somebody else let's say the
 
05:13:19.230 --> 05:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
shoreline is is incurring the the
 
05:13:22.590 --> 05:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
cost um how how can we make the one for
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
one knowing that the expense over here
 
05:13:27.830 --> 05:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
is what is causing the cost over here
 
05:13:29.470 --> 05:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
not some other thing that's causing the
 
05:13:32.430 --> 05:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
cost over here and then who is
 
05:13:34.868 --> 05:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
we're we're using Financial on this side
 
05:13:36.510 --> 05:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
right but we're using environmental on
 
05:13:38.708 --> 05:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
this side so who is the
 
05:13:42.510 --> 05:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
agreed party in that um you know because
 
05:13:44.750 --> 05:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
I would assume that in a and I'm getting
 
05:13:46.990 --> 05:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
to a question uh I I assume in a
 
05:13:49.390 --> 05:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
scenario like this you would typically
 
05:13:52.430 --> 05:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
take the the money from the fee over
 
05:13:54.110 --> 05:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
here and you would apply it to the agre
 
05:13:56.310 --> 05:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
party over here to cover the cost that
 
05:13:59.750 --> 05:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
they've incurred um this seems like far
 
05:14:02.430 --> 05:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
too simple of a bill to take all of
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
those things into consideration so how
 
05:14:07.030 --> 05:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
would how do you kind of square those
 
05:14:08.670 --> 05:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
multi I'll take the last part first
 
05:14:10.470 --> 05:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
which is it it clearly the bill does not
 
05:14:12.110 --> 05:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
fully encapsulate everything that's
 
05:14:13.470 --> 05:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
going on that's why I think I
 
05:14:14.750 --> 05:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
characterize as a step in the right
 
05:14:17.110 --> 05:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
direction the methodology which you
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely correctly described as being
 
05:14:21.708 --> 05:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
complex is very similar to any cost
 
05:14:23.310 --> 05:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis that you do with
 
05:14:25.030 --> 05:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
regulation so you you know you say I'm
 
05:14:26.590 --> 05:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
going to make an airplane
 
05:14:30.270 --> 05:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
safer hand you know 127 people fewer
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
will die we think that's estimate we
 
05:14:34.948 --> 05:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
then have to put a dollar figure on
 
05:14:36.628 --> 05:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
their lives which is awkward and
 
05:14:38.110 --> 05:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and unrealistic but we do
 
05:14:40.190 --> 05:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
it every Federal agency has a cost per
 
05:14:42.190 --> 05:14:42.200 align:start position:0%
life saved and so on in this case we
 
05:14:43.788 --> 05:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
would do basically the same thing we
 
05:14:47.708 --> 05:14:47.718 align:start position:0%
would say okay here are the the damages
 
05:14:50.190 --> 05:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
we think are happening from both climate
 
05:14:51.750 --> 05:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
change and conventional pollutants
 
05:14:53.070 --> 05:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
because remember if you put a tax on
 
05:14:54.548 --> 05:14:54.558 align:start position:0%
carbon you're also going to reduce other
 
05:14:57.390 --> 05:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
pollutants and so that means asthma and
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things uh but also
 
05:15:01.310 --> 05:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
climate change and you're going to say
 
05:15:02.590 --> 05:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to go to the Sea Coast
 
05:15:04.070 --> 05:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
which is a good example and you're going
 
05:15:06.628 --> 05:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
to say here are the damages that we
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
think are the result of climate change
 
05:15:11.070 --> 05:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
and we're going to put a price on that
 
05:15:13.750 --> 05:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
and then what economists do and again
 
05:15:15.708 --> 05:15:15.718 align:start position:0%
it's more art than science but there is
 
05:15:17.990 --> 05:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
science there is they will say we
 
05:15:20.230 --> 05:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
believe that for every ton of carbon
 
05:15:24.310 --> 05:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
that is emitted here are the damages and
 
05:15:26.190 --> 05:15:26.200 align:start position:0%
the the market costs of those damages
 
05:15:28.110 --> 05:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
including things like lost lives so to
 
05:15:30.510 --> 05:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
repair a property or to protect a
 
05:15:33.788 --> 05:15:33.798 align:start position:0%
property or to air conditioned things or
 
05:15:36.150 --> 05:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
loss of Revenue to the ski industry and
 
05:15:37.708 --> 05:15:37.718 align:start position:0%
then you do connect to die you say that
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know a ton of carbon We Believe
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
leads to these social costs for people
 
05:15:44.110 --> 05:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire or New England
 
05:15:45.390 --> 05:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
and then you that's where you get your
 
05:15:47.708 --> 05:15:47.718 align:start position:0%
price per ton of carbon emissions and
 
05:15:49.910 --> 05:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
you start you know some usually what you
 
05:15:52.430 --> 05:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
get is a range $60 to $90 or something
 
05:15:53.788 --> 05:15:53.798 align:start position:0%
like that you can choose the high range
 
05:15:56.070 --> 05:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
the low range but again the point is
 
05:16:00.628 --> 05:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
it's not nothing and so by taking carbon
 
05:16:02.270 --> 05:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
emissions into account procurement
 
05:16:03.910 --> 05:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
you're at least moving in a direction
 
05:16:05.910 --> 05:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
where you're making a decision that is
 
05:16:08.390 --> 05:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
more consistent with the true cost to
 
05:16:11.708 --> 05:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state follow up follow
 
05:16:14.470 --> 05:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
up I so I understand the the theory
 
05:16:17.070 --> 05:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
behind it but by not being accurate in
 
05:16:18.990 --> 05:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
your assessment of what the carbon cost
 
05:16:21.590 --> 05:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
is couldn't you very easily throw some
 
05:16:25.788 --> 05:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
other cost out of whack um and then be
 
05:16:28.628 --> 05:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
making poor decisions unintentionally
 
05:16:30.190 --> 05:16:30.200 align:start position:0%
because your carbon pricing is way out
 
05:16:32.110 --> 05:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
of out of line so for example example if
 
05:16:34.310 --> 05:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
we overdo the carbon pricing on let's
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
say a um a plow truck in the winter time
 
05:16:40.110 --> 05:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
and say okay well now the carbon
 
05:16:41.548 --> 05:16:41.558 align:start position:0%
emissions of this plow truck have
 
05:16:43.430 --> 05:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed the overall cost of the
 
05:16:45.270 --> 05:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
truck so it seems like buying this other
 
05:16:47.788 --> 05:16:47.798 align:start position:0%
truck over here is the better option so
 
05:16:49.350 --> 05:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
then we invest in these other trucks
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
over here um but they're they're not as
 
05:16:54.310 --> 05:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
they don't endure as well they don't
 
05:16:56.510 --> 05:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
have the same kind of uh lifespan that
 
05:16:57.948 --> 05:16:57.958 align:start position:0%
we thought they were going to and so
 
05:17:00.430 --> 05:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
then that then in turn increases uh
 
05:17:02.590 --> 05:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
maybe Public Safety maybe uh you end up
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
with a situation where they don't plow
 
05:17:05.868 --> 05:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
as well they're not you know they don't
 
05:17:07.270 --> 05:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
get the roads as clean or whatever
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
because they're not they weren't you
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
know the the evaluation changed
 
05:17:16.110 --> 05:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
um it just seems like it could turn into
 
05:17:18.548 --> 05:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
a a spiral where you're constantly
 
05:17:20.390 --> 05:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
trying to mitigate factors that are
 
05:17:22.070 --> 05:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
constantly moving because they're
 
05:17:24.030 --> 05:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
they're not one for ones right I mean
 
05:17:25.910 --> 05:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's almost impossible to come up for a
 
05:17:27.868 --> 05:17:27.878 align:start position:0%
one for one cost benefit analysis in
 
05:17:29.750 --> 05:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
that scenario from my perspective but am
 
05:17:30.830 --> 05:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
I wrong can you help me out there no
 
05:17:32.470 --> 05:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
you're you're absolutely right I would
 
05:17:34.510 --> 05:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
urge you to think of it in in two steps
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
one is do we think that there's some
 
05:17:40.350 --> 05:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
social cost of carbon emissions which is
 
05:17:42.030 --> 05:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
you know conceptually an important link
 
05:17:44.590 --> 05:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
an economist would say universally yes
 
05:17:45.990 --> 05:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
and then the second is all right now
 
05:17:47.750 --> 05:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to put a price on it which I
 
05:17:50.430 --> 05:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
think you're correct it it is tricky but
 
05:17:52.270 --> 05:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
as I alluded to earlier it's very
 
05:17:54.350 --> 05:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
similar to doing any kind of Regulation
 
05:17:56.590 --> 05:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
where airlines are pretty good
 
05:17:59.390 --> 05:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
example we do things up to the point
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
where we think they're no longer cost
 
05:18:03.070 --> 05:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
effective so we could have five pilots
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
in every plane because that certainly
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
mitigates the risk that four die in one
 
05:18:10.910 --> 05:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
but that would make air travel cost
 
05:18:13.230 --> 05:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
prohibitive on the other hand we do
 
05:18:14.910 --> 05:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
invest in other kinds of safety and
 
05:18:17.628 --> 05:18:17.638 align:start position:0%
training where we think okay given the
 
05:18:20.230 --> 05:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
likely savings and we're just estimating
 
05:18:21.788 --> 05:18:21.798 align:start position:0%
we think these things are relatively
 
05:18:23.350 --> 05:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
coste effective so I'd urge you to think
 
05:18:26.548 --> 05:18:26.558 align:start position:0%
of it in the same framework as both
 
05:18:28.830 --> 05:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
private and public companies used to
 
05:18:31.830 --> 05:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
weigh cost and benefits well one last
 
05:18:34.190 --> 05:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
follow up follow thank you so taking the
 
05:18:36.750 --> 05:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
airline industry as an example though um
 
05:18:38.350 --> 05:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
the airline industry to a certain extent
 
05:18:40.110 --> 05:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
ends up getting subsidized in that
 
05:18:43.190 --> 05:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
scenario does it not my my concern is
 
05:18:46.230 --> 05:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
that when you when you put those kind of
 
05:18:49.990 --> 05:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
economic pressures into play cost spiral
 
05:18:51.270 --> 05:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
to such an extent that everything
 
05:18:51.280 --> 05:18:52.230 align:start position:0%
to such an extent that everything
becomes

05:18:52.230 --> 05:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
05:18:54.990 --> 05:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
unaffordable um that that I mean just a
 
05:18:56.430 --> 05:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
concern at least off the top of my head
 
05:18:58.590 --> 05:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
that I have for example airline travel
 
05:19:00.110 --> 05:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
does spiral out of control where it
 
05:19:02.750 --> 05:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
becomes impossible for people to fly
 
05:19:04.430 --> 05:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
because when you take all of you I mean
 
05:19:06.350 --> 05:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
you can make expenses that make
 
05:19:09.110 --> 05:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
everything you know basically untenable
 
05:19:11.110 --> 05:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
um so that I guess that would be my
 
05:19:12.830 --> 05:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
concern is are we not going to just
 
05:19:14.070 --> 05:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
apply those same principles to
 
05:19:15.350 --> 05:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
everything and find ourselves in a
 
05:19:17.708 --> 05:19:17.718 align:start position:0%
situation where economics break down
 
05:19:20.510 --> 05:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
because nothing's affordable anymore I
 
05:19:21.750 --> 05:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
guess I would interpret it differently
 
05:19:23.470 --> 05:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
which is airline travel in this country
 
05:19:25.430 --> 05:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
is remarkably safe we just finished the
 
05:19:26.990 --> 05:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
sixth or seventh year without a single
 
05:19:29.708 --> 05:19:29.718 align:start position:0%
commercial Fatality and prices in real
 
05:19:31.948 --> 05:19:31.958 align:start position:0%
terms have dropped steadily for 20 years
 
05:19:34.190 --> 05:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
ever since we deregulated it and so we
 
05:19:35.708 --> 05:19:35.718 align:start position:0%
you know nothing is Affordable for
 
05:19:36.990 --> 05:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
everybody but we've definitely gotten to
 
05:19:39.948 --> 05:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
a place where we've struck a balance
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
where it is remarkably safe certainly
 
05:19:45.190 --> 05:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
relative to driving and more accessible
 
05:19:47.510 --> 05:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
than it was okay thank you very much
 
05:19:49.470 --> 05:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate it all right does anyone else
 
05:19:52.070 --> 05:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
wish to uh ask a question
 
05:19:56.190 --> 05:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
or represent Brown thank you madam chair
 
05:19:59.430 --> 05:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:02.708 --> 05:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
here would I translate correctly into
 
05:20:05.548 --> 05:20:05.558 align:start position:0%
saying from what you said and probably
 
05:20:10.510 --> 05:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
not but because we can't get people to
 
05:20:13.628 --> 05:20:13.638 align:start position:0%
do maybe what some would like them to do
 
05:20:16.708 --> 05:20:16.718 align:start position:0%
from a carbon standpoint we're going to
 
05:20:19.190 --> 05:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
force them to do it this way something
 
05:20:23.910 --> 05:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
as you said that to the effect of uh uh
 
05:20:26.670 --> 05:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
get it gives the the state the power to
 
05:20:28.990 --> 05:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
look at the real social cost and if
 
05:20:31.350 --> 05:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
polluters don't get it then we we can
 
05:20:33.310 --> 05:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
derive their behavior by doing this and
 
05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
I hopefully that wasn't too unclear yeah
 
05:20:38.910 --> 05:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
yeah no I would not use the word Force
 
05:20:40.750 --> 05:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
the whole point is we're changing the
 
05:20:43.310 --> 05:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
price just like we do with taxes on
 
05:20:45.150 --> 05:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
cigarettes so that the price of smoking
 
05:20:47.190 --> 05:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
more closely approximates the cost of
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of us or any other time where
 
05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
we use a tax or a price to Signal a
 
05:20:54.390 --> 05:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
different incentive co-pays with
 
05:20:56.750 --> 05:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
insurance or anything like that so the
 
05:20:58.948 --> 05:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
alternative again if you are compelled
 
05:21:01.430 --> 05:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
to do something about climate emissions
 
05:21:04.150 --> 05:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
the alternative is to force people
 
05:21:05.750 --> 05:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's through regulations around
 
05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
automobiles or again you know
 
05:21:10.948 --> 05:21:10.958 align:start position:0%
regulations around insulating your attic
 
05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
or regulations on the electricity
 
05:21:16.788 --> 05:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
efficiency of certain appliances so to
 
05:21:19.150 --> 05:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
to the mind of an economist changing
 
05:21:22.030 --> 05:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
prices allows you or the state to still
 
05:21:23.430 --> 05:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
make whatever decision you want you can
 
05:21:26.030 --> 05:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
buy whatever truck you want but the
 
05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
price signals to whoever's doing the
 
05:21:33.708 --> 05:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
behavior that you know this is the price
 
05:21:35.670 --> 05:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with taking into
 
05:21:37.548 --> 05:21:37.558 align:start position:0%
account how it affects everybody else in
 
05:21:37.558 --> 05:21:40.548 align:start position:0%
account how it affects everybody else in
our

05:21:40.548 --> 05:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:43.670 --> 05:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
state any other questions representative
 
05:21:47.390 --> 05:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick um as a Layman I'm pretty
 
05:21:47.400 --> 05:21:49.150 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick um as a Layman I'm pretty
much

05:21:49.150 --> 05:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:21:53.430 --> 05:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh subject to the popular media and I
 
05:21:58.150 --> 05:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
very rarely ever hear it discussed the
 
05:22:03.628 --> 05:22:03.638 align:start position:0%
cost of manufactur in the let's use
 
05:22:06.430 --> 05:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
electric cars for the ex example the
 
05:22:08.990 --> 05:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
amount of carbon that is burned in
 
05:22:11.670 --> 05:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
mining the lithium for instance and
 
05:22:15.190 --> 05:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
let's not even talk about uh charging an
 
05:22:17.910 --> 05:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
electric car with electricity that comes
 
05:22:23.230 --> 05:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
from carbon from carbon fuels so in this
 
05:22:28.390 --> 05:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
topic are there charts or variables or
 
05:22:31.470 --> 05:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
some mechanism to take into account
 
05:22:39.670 --> 05:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:44.948 --> 05:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
uh pollution that comes with the uh Manu
 
05:22:47.230 --> 05:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing of these vehicles yeah
 
05:22:48.628 --> 05:22:48.638 align:start position:0%
no you rais a really good point which is
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
most coverage of electric vehicles in
 
05:22:54.548 --> 05:22:54.558 align:start position:0%
particular is very sloppy in that regard
 
05:22:58.230 --> 05:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
and so this bill if enacted properly
 
05:23:00.548 --> 05:23:00.558 align:start position:0%
would and should take into account the
 
05:23:03.190 --> 05:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
Environ Al cost of the lithium batteries
 
05:23:04.670 --> 05:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
you know if you're driving electric car
 
05:23:07.110 --> 05:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
using coal powerered electricity you're
 
05:23:09.230 --> 05:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
probably worse than using something
 
05:23:11.670 --> 05:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
that's dve from natural gas so if this
 
05:23:13.030 --> 05:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
is done properly and I hope it would be
 
05:23:15.868 --> 05:23:15.878 align:start position:0%
done properly then the full lifetime
 
05:23:18.868 --> 05:23:18.878 align:start position:0%
cost from manufacturer use of the
 
05:23:21.070 --> 05:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
battery where the power comes from is
 
05:23:23.708 --> 05:23:23.718 align:start position:0%
the appropriate way to price whatever is
 
05:23:26.110 --> 05:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
being used I mean I was up in Hover and
 
05:23:28.830 --> 05:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
I parked at the dry cleaner behind a guy
 
05:23:31.030 --> 05:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
it was a Tesla and the license plate
 
05:23:32.670 --> 05:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
said what
 
05:23:35.628 --> 05:23:35.638 align:start position:0%
CO2 and what I wanted to say is the CO2
 
05:23:37.390 --> 05:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
that comes from whatever power source
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
you charge your car with I mean it's the
 
05:23:40.430 --> 05:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
closest I've ever come to keying
 
05:23:43.628 --> 05:23:43.638 align:start position:0%
somebody's car I did not uh but your
 
05:23:46.390 --> 05:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
point is is important but consistent
 
05:23:47.868 --> 05:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
with what we're talking about here
 
05:23:52.150 --> 05:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
followup followup then is it being done
 
05:23:56.590 --> 05:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
today in other words this type of a calc
 
05:24:00.110 --> 05:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
calculation are are you know would it be
 
05:24:03.230 --> 05:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
available now for a purchasing agent for
 
05:24:05.350 --> 05:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
instance it yes it should be that if you
 
05:24:07.030 --> 05:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
get the right people to do the analysis
 
05:24:08.788 --> 05:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
again it's not precise but it would be
 
05:24:11.590 --> 05:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
directionally correct and they would
 
05:24:13.510 --> 05:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
take into account the full life cycle of
 
05:24:15.070 --> 05:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
what you're doing again all of this is
 
05:24:16.628 --> 05:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
much easier if you have a
 
05:24:20.030 --> 05:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
broad-based price on carbon because then
 
05:24:21.670 --> 05:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know there's a tax on whatever
 
05:24:23.190 --> 05:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
energy is used to make the battery
 
05:24:25.430 --> 05:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's a tax on whatever is used to
 
05:24:27.430 --> 05:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
produce the energy for the electric car
 
05:24:29.350 --> 05:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
so it's a little trickier without that
 
05:24:31.350 --> 05:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
you know accurate price on carbon
 
05:24:33.708 --> 05:24:33.718 align:start position:0%
everywhere but yes any sophisticated
 
05:24:37.150 --> 05:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
analysis any Economist who is legitimate
 
05:24:38.948 --> 05:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh would take into account the full life
 
05:24:41.070 --> 05:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
cycle of a product or service when
 
05:24:42.548 --> 05:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
they're trying to assess what the true
 
05:24:44.910 --> 05:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
environmental cost is thank you thank
 
05:24:47.110 --> 05:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
you madam chair represent gold thank you
 
05:24:48.788 --> 05:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
05:24:51.110 --> 05:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
question you said if you get the right
 
05:24:53.190 --> 05:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
person to do the analysis the cost
 
05:24:56.230 --> 05:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
analysis and my question would be in
 
05:24:59.350 --> 05:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
this case if this bill passes for New
 
05:25:03.310 --> 05:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh procurement officials who
 
05:25:05.310 --> 05:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
are the right people they would get to
 
05:25:07.628 --> 05:25:07.638 align:start position:0%
do the cost analysis Yeah by right
 
05:25:09.750 --> 05:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
person I don't mean you know Bob or S I
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
mean somebody who has the proper
 
05:25:15.990 --> 05:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
training and is not partisan and can you
 
05:25:19.190 --> 05:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
know is trained in cost benefit analysis
 
05:25:21.548 --> 05:25:21.558 align:start position:0%
and has a transparent process that's
 
05:25:23.788 --> 05:25:23.798 align:start position:0%
subject to input that you know it's it's
 
05:25:24.990 --> 05:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
kind of like saying if you get the right
 
05:25:27.788 --> 05:25:27.798 align:start position:0%
person to do cancer treatment you know
 
05:25:28.948 --> 05:25:28.958 align:start position:0%
they'll get the chemotherapy you know
 
05:25:30.190 --> 05:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
again it's not a specific person but
 
05:25:32.350 --> 05:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
there's a process for doing this just
 
05:25:33.670 --> 05:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
like there's a process for doing
 
05:25:35.430 --> 05:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
something else and I would I don't know
 
05:25:36.628 --> 05:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state government
 
05:25:38.070 --> 05:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
government well enough to know where the
 
05:25:40.190 --> 05:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
expertise is on that but that is
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
something that if you have a state
 
05:25:44.990 --> 05:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
Economist or people along those lines
 
05:25:46.110 --> 05:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
this is something that they would either
 
05:25:47.910 --> 05:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
be trained to do or could find the
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
people who could do it fairly
 
05:25:53.310 --> 05:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
transparently appropriately thank you
 
05:25:53.320 --> 05:25:57.150 align:start position:0%
transparently appropriately thank you
thank

05:25:57.150 --> 05:25:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.110 --> 05:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for your
 
05:26:00.750 --> 05:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't see any more question
 
05:26:02.350 --> 05:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you for your
 
05:26:05.788 --> 05:26:05.798 align:start position:0%
time okay I address represent assign
 
05:26:07.150 --> 05:26:07.160 align:start position:0%
question because I have a specific
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:18.470 --> 05:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
please oh sorry I I just wanted to to
 
05:26:19.990 --> 05:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
provide some clarity in this bill the
 
05:26:21.470 --> 05:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
question of kind of that one toone
 
05:26:24.190 --> 05:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
correlation between a cost and an effect
 
05:26:27.110 --> 05:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
this uh model of where we begin with the
 
05:26:29.230 --> 05:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
price and as it escalates over time
 
05:26:32.070 --> 05:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
brings us in line with existing carbon
 
05:26:32.080 --> 05:26:33.270 align:start position:0%
brings us in line with existing carbon
pricing

05:26:33.270 --> 05:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
pricing
 
05:26:35.788 --> 05:26:35.798 align:start position:0%
markets that's why those that's where
 
05:26:38.670 --> 05:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
those specific costs come from so that
 
05:26:41.788 --> 05:26:41.798 align:start position:0%
our decisions would be in line with
 
05:26:43.708 --> 05:26:43.718 align:start position:0%
currently existing carbon pricing models
 
05:26:46.190 --> 05:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
for example in Canada and the European
 
05:26:50.190 --> 05:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
Union and and those um and and I believe
 
05:26:52.230 --> 05:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
speaker will be coming up soon can can
 
05:26:54.990 --> 05:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
talk about this that modeling is based
 
05:26:56.788 --> 05:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
on it's the
 
05:26:59.190 --> 05:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
intergovernmental panel on climate
 
05:27:02.590 --> 05:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
control looking at trying to keep global
 
05:27:06.910 --> 05:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
warming below at at at 1.5 degrees
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
centigrate looking at $135 a ton as the
 
05:27:14.590 --> 05:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
likely price point that would achieve
 
05:27:16.708 --> 05:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
that goal and that is and we could
 
05:27:19.150 --> 05:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
disagree however one feels about the
 
05:27:21.948 --> 05:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
ipcc the fact of the matter is that the
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
Canadian market and the European market
 
05:27:26.510 --> 05:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
trading major trading partners for the
 
05:27:29.310 --> 05:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
United States are using these price
 
05:27:31.110 --> 05:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
points and American
 
05:27:34.590 --> 05:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
are going to be paying penalties as we
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
export into those markets based upon
 
05:27:40.750 --> 05:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
those models so this model was
 
05:27:42.708 --> 05:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
specifically and these numbers were
 
05:27:45.350 --> 05:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
specifically uh chosen because they will
 
05:27:46.990 --> 05:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
bring us in line
 
05:27:49.750 --> 05:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
with trading
 
05:27:52.868 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
partners Simon thank you um just because
 
05:27:54.990 --> 05:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for some light reading to do
 
05:27:57.190 --> 05:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
on the side would you be able to get me
 
05:28:00.590 --> 05:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
any of the information on the models
 
05:28:01.868 --> 05:28:01.878 align:start position:0%
they use to come up with their
 
05:28:04.390 --> 05:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
calculations yes absolutely and in fact
 
05:28:06.990 --> 05:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh John Gage who will be testifying I
 
05:28:08.948 --> 05:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
believe he has sent the committee uh his
 
05:28:10.830 --> 05:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and it contains a number of
 
05:28:13.510 --> 05:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
hyperlinks uh that contain all of this
 
05:28:15.070 --> 05:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
information I'm happy to follow up with
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
that as well but uh all of the modeling
 
05:28:20.270 --> 05:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
that was used in this case is contained
 
05:28:22.548 --> 05:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
within the documentation that Mr Gage
 
05:28:24.190 --> 05:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
sent with his testimony okay great thank
 
05:28:27.670 --> 05:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
you you representative Dolan thank you
 
05:28:31.430 --> 05:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair the um question I have is is
 
05:28:36.110 --> 05:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
with with our current consumers uh
 
05:28:38.430 --> 05:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
struggling mightily to keep up with
 
05:28:41.230 --> 05:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
additional costs of living and so forth
 
05:28:43.470 --> 05:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
who who do we expect is going to be
 
05:28:46.190 --> 05:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
paying these carbon taxes that we're
 
05:28:47.910 --> 05:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
talking about here this additional
 
05:28:50.708 --> 05:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
carbon I I thank you very much for for
 
05:28:52.708 --> 05:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
your uh for your question I also wanted
 
05:28:55.628 --> 05:28:55.638 align:start position:0%
to clarify we are not talking about
 
05:28:58.110 --> 05:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
changing the market and we are not
 
05:29:00.390 --> 05:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
talking about a tax that is applied to
 
05:29:01.990 --> 05:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
consumers we are talking about State
 
05:29:03.868 --> 05:29:03.878 align:start position:0%
spending decisions so some of these
 
05:29:06.230 --> 05:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
larger questions like the one that you
 
05:29:08.030 --> 05:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
ask which I think is a very real and
 
05:29:11.230 --> 05:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
important question I would argue is not
 
05:29:13.350 --> 05:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
a relevant question to this particular
 
05:29:16.070 --> 05:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
case what we're actually arguing is that
 
05:29:19.350 --> 05:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will save money if the state
 
05:29:21.670 --> 05:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
uses a more fiscally responsible which
 
05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
is we're arguing that that's what this
 
05:29:25.868 --> 05:29:25.878 align:start position:0%
is it will actually save taxpayers money
 
05:29:28.470 --> 05:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
so the larger question um and I and I
 
05:29:31.070 --> 05:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank the the professor for his expert
 
05:29:33.708 --> 05:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
testimony but the larger question of
 
05:29:35.430 --> 05:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
markets is not the question for this
 
05:29:37.990 --> 05:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
bill this bill is specific to how the
 
05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
state makes procurement decisions it's
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
not a tax and it's not meant to drive
 
05:29:46.548 --> 05:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
consumer Behavior we are talking about
 
05:29:48.788 --> 05:29:48.798 align:start position:0%
the consumer that is us which is the
 
05:29:50.510 --> 05:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and how we make
 
05:29:54.230 --> 05:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:57.430 --> 05:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
procurement B leus yeah just to clarify
 
05:29:59.070 --> 05:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
if I understand the bill
 
05:30:02.990 --> 05:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
correctly um all it does is require a
 
05:30:07.788 --> 05:30:07.798 align:start position:0%
report on the uh aggregate um the amount
 
05:30:09.670 --> 05:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
of you know Carbon that's going to be
 
05:30:12.990 --> 05:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
emitted based on all the the state or
 
05:30:14.990 --> 05:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
just State activities times whatever
 
05:30:17.948 --> 05:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
your numbers are in here is that correct
 
05:30:19.708 --> 05:30:19.718 align:start position:0%
no and I should grab a copy of the bill
 
05:30:21.270 --> 05:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
I apologize for not having immediately
 
05:30:22.270 --> 05:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
in front of me but there are kind of two
 
05:30:24.548 --> 05:30:24.558 align:start position:0%
parts to the bill one is that the state
 
05:30:27.830 --> 05:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
will take a proxin proxy carbon pricing
 
05:30:29.430 --> 05:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
into account when it makes purchasing
 
05:30:32.350 --> 05:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
decisions the second part short I think
 
05:30:34.110 --> 05:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
sentence in the second part of the bill
 
05:30:36.030 --> 05:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly is that the
 
05:30:37.470 --> 05:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
state will also
 
05:30:41.070 --> 05:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
publish uh in its annual Energy report
 
05:30:43.868 --> 05:30:43.878 align:start position:0%
and will publish uh these you know the
 
05:30:45.430 --> 05:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
outcome of their assessments you know so
 
05:30:46.628 --> 05:30:46.638 align:start position:0%
if they're going to say we need to
 
05:30:48.390 --> 05:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
purchase X number of vehicles for our
 
05:30:51.230 --> 05:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
Fleet or as our annual energy reports do
 
05:30:53.310 --> 05:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
now right thinking about the projects
 
05:30:56.230 --> 05:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
that the state has in line for
 
05:30:58.430 --> 05:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
renovation or construction right when
 
05:31:01.548 --> 05:31:01.558 align:start position:0%
those um uh calculations are made about
 
05:31:04.350 --> 05:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
how much those the energy footprint of
 
05:31:07.788 --> 05:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
of those buildings it'll go into our
 
05:31:09.910 --> 05:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
annual Energy
 
05:31:09.920 --> 05:31:11.910 align:start position:0%

report
 
05:31:14.470 --> 05:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm still looking at it but
 
05:31:18.230 --> 05:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions thank
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you for allowing me to come
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%

05:31:48.350 --> 05:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:50.190 --> 05:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chairwoman I'm John Gage from
 
05:31:54.750 --> 05:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
Windham I'm a volunteer of a national
 
05:31:57.070 --> 05:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan Grassroots organization
 
05:31:59.470 --> 05:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
called citizens climate Lobby we have
 
05:32:03.788 --> 05:32:03.798 align:start position:0%
1,000 800 members in New Hampshire and
 
05:32:05.430 --> 05:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure every one of them
 
05:32:09.750 --> 05:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
supports this bill um can I have a count
 
05:32:12.190 --> 05:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
of the online support and opposition of
 
05:32:14.750 --> 05:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
the bill if that's possible uh we do you
 
05:32:16.830 --> 05:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
have that
 
05:32:19.470 --> 05:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
um that question do you have the on
 
05:32:22.788 --> 05:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:27.030 --> 05:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:29.470 --> 05:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
portal we don't have it handy thank you
 
05:32:32.070 --> 05:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
will'll will be included okay there was
 
05:32:35.190 --> 05:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
170 to3 the last time I
 
05:32:39.150 --> 05:32:39.160 align:start position:0%
checked um so this is not a case where
 
05:32:41.750 --> 05:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
we need to come up with a carbon price
 
05:32:43.868 --> 05:32:43.878 align:start position:0%
there's actually kind of two ways you
 
05:32:46.470 --> 05:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
can price carbon one is what is the
 
05:32:48.830 --> 05:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
social cost of it which is an extremely
 
05:32:51.230 --> 05:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
complicated thing which depends on
 
05:32:53.510 --> 05:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
factors like the discount rate which um
 
05:32:55.310 --> 05:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
make it render it pretty much impossible
 
05:32:59.310 --> 05:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
to figure or we can pick a temperature
 
05:33:03.470 --> 05:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
Target that we want to hold warming to
 
05:33:06.830 --> 05:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh economists can estimate the carbon
 
05:33:09.910 --> 05:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
price necessary to reduce emissions to
 
05:33:12.230 --> 05:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
reach that Target with complimentary
 
05:33:14.510 --> 05:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
policies and that is where this price
 
05:33:18.310 --> 05:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
came from on page two of the handout um
 
05:33:20.230 --> 05:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
there's a quote from the
 
05:33:21.708 --> 05:33:21.718 align:start position:0%
intergovernmental panel on climate
 
05:33:24.628 --> 05:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
change is global it's the special report
 
05:33:27.628 --> 05:33:27.638 align:start position:0%
on global warming of 1.5 degrees came
 
05:33:30.990 --> 05:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
out a couple years ago um
 
05:33:34.390 --> 05:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
looking at all of the analysis of um
 
05:33:36.310 --> 05:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
published economics
 
05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
on what prices are needed to reduce
 
05:33:42.708 --> 05:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
emissions to achieve a 1.5 degrees
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
Target the line says estimates for below
 
05:33:49.868 --> 05:33:49.878 align:start position:0%
1.5 degrees pathway range from $135 blah
 
05:33:51.590 --> 05:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah blah in
 
05:33:56.750 --> 05:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
2030 so $135 in 2030 is the minimum
 
05:34:00.030 --> 05:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
price um it goes much higher than that
 
05:34:02.470 --> 05:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
because uh it might take a much higher
 
05:34:04.948 --> 05:34:04.958 align:start position:0%
price to drive emissions down this is a
 
05:34:08.470 --> 05:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
global price on fossil fuels fossil fuel
 
05:34:08.480 --> 05:34:10.390 align:start position:0%
global price on fossil fuels fossil fuel
use

05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:34:13.590 --> 05:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
um the ipcc Report was generated by
 
05:34:15.190 --> 05:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
hundreds of climate scientists
 
05:34:17.910 --> 05:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
volunteering their time reviewing tens
 
05:34:20.230 --> 05:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
of thousands of climate science reports
 
05:34:21.628 --> 05:34:21.638 align:start position:0%
and some of the world's leading
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
economists um looking at adaptation and
 
05:34:28.510 --> 05:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
mitigation options so we don't know the
 
05:34:30.548 --> 05:34:30.558 align:start position:0%
exact price to hold warm to an exact
 
05:34:32.430 --> 05:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
temperature but this is our best
 
05:34:34.948 --> 05:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
estimate is somewhere between $135 and
 
05:34:39.150 --> 05:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
$6,000 in 2030 and Rising 8 to $10 per
 
05:34:42.030 --> 05:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
ton through the rest of the century so
 
05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
we just picked the minimum of that price
 
05:34:47.230 --> 05:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
range for 1.5 degrees world we picked
 
05:34:48.910 --> 05:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
that because that's the temperature that
 
05:34:51.910 --> 05:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
every country in the nation in the world
 
05:34:55.390 --> 05:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
has committed to achieving um driving
 
05:34:58.750 --> 05:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
emissions down about 50% by 2030 and
 
05:35:02.430 --> 05:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
down a Net Zero by 20 2050 we need a
 
05:35:04.230 --> 05:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
really high carbon price and that's
 
05:35:06.030 --> 05:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
about half of the solution and there's a
 
05:35:08.230 --> 05:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of compl complimentary
 
05:35:10.030 --> 05:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
policies that are also
 
05:35:13.868 --> 05:35:13.878 align:start position:0%
needed but this is a bill to save the
 
05:35:16.270 --> 05:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
state money by paying attention to
 
05:35:18.470 --> 05:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
what's going on we're not trying to save
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
the world here we're trying to save
 
05:35:20.320 --> 05:35:21.788 align:start position:0%
the world here we're trying to save
taxpayer

05:35:21.788 --> 05:35:21.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
05:35:24.990 --> 05:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
dollars we can do that by
 
05:35:27.830 --> 05:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
anticipating This Global carbon price
 
05:35:30.110 --> 05:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to come to New Hampshire so
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
sometime it's not a stable price this
 
05:35:35.868 --> 05:35:35.878 align:start position:0%
price is rising over time it's not that
 
05:35:38.430 --> 05:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
we can start 10 years later and start at
 
05:35:42.110 --> 05:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
that price 10 years after 2030 uh it's
 
05:35:44.190 --> 05:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
going to be $100 more per ton it'll be
 
05:35:47.470 --> 05:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
200 $230 per ton will be the minimum
 
05:35:50.110 --> 05:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
price that the world needs on fossil
 
05:35:52.948 --> 05:35:52.958 align:start position:0%
fuels the US is standing still there's a
 
05:35:55.788 --> 05:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
growing carbon price gap between where
 
05:35:58.510 --> 05:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
the US is and where the GL Global carbon
 
05:36:00.708 --> 05:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
price needs to be but also where our
 
05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
trading partners
 
05:36:05.390 --> 05:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
are um as representative germon
 
05:36:09.310 --> 05:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
said Europe is at $85 per ton of CO2
 
05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
today um it has tripled in the last
 
05:36:14.948 --> 05:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
three or four years uh and it will
 
05:36:18.190 --> 05:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
continue going up because um they want a
 
05:36:21.708 --> 05:36:21.718 align:start position:0%
higher price Canada is using a policy
 
05:36:24.350 --> 05:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
called carbon Fe and dividend they are
 
05:36:27.390 --> 05:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
taxing the fossil fuel industry for
 
05:36:29.750 --> 05:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
Carbon on fossil fuel production and and
 
05:36:32.030 --> 05:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
rebating all the money back to its
 
05:36:35.470 --> 05:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
citizens um now this is smart most
 
05:36:37.510 --> 05:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
families come out ahead more money than
 
05:36:39.990 --> 05:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
they have right now after paying the
 
05:36:42.910 --> 05:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
trickle down higher costs um my
 
05:36:44.430 --> 05:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
organization is trying to get Congress
 
05:36:46.868 --> 05:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
to do this carbon fee and dividend a
 
05:36:49.110 --> 05:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
bill has been in Congress the last four
 
05:36:52.310 --> 05:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
sessions it was introduced in 2017 as a
 
05:36:56.948 --> 05:36:56.958 align:start position:0%
bipartisan byal bill um last session it
 
05:37:00.110 --> 05:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
achieved 96 co-sponsors in the house
 
05:37:03.430 --> 05:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
in the discussions of the reconciliation
 
05:37:05.910 --> 05:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
package it was included a variation was
 
05:37:08.628 --> 05:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
included and it missed being included by
 
05:37:08.638 --> 05:37:09.390 align:start position:0%
included and it missed being included by
one

05:37:09.390 --> 05:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:37:12.510 --> 05:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
vote so what can we do in New
 
05:37:15.350 --> 05:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we can anticipate a carbon
 
05:37:20.110 --> 05:37:20.120 align:start position:0%
price in the price of fossil fuels not
 
05:37:23.628 --> 05:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
now but in the future so when we buy
 
05:37:25.788 --> 05:37:25.798 align:start position:0%
something to heat a building for the
 
05:37:29.150 --> 05:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
State uh we can use current prices or we
 
05:37:30.110 --> 05:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
can an
 
05:37:33.830 --> 05:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate the minimum carbon price uh
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
that the experts say is required to meet
 
05:37:37.470 --> 05:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
the global
 
05:37:40.110 --> 05:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
goals that seems reasonable to me
 
05:37:42.868 --> 05:37:42.878 align:start position:0%
there's lots of fiscally responsible
 
05:37:46.830 --> 05:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
reasons to do this uh we will save money
 
05:37:51.270 --> 05:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
by Saving avoiding stranded costs we uh
 
05:37:54.670 --> 05:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
conquered steam um was the first bill I
 
05:37:56.948 --> 05:37:56.958 align:start position:0%
ever tesi first time I ever testified in
 
05:38:00.070 --> 05:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
front of a State Hearing um
 
05:38:02.030 --> 05:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
I was asking if anybody had considered
 
05:38:03.750 --> 05:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
the cost of the pollution if we started
 
05:38:05.830 --> 05:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
using natural gas to heat state
 
05:38:09.510 --> 05:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
buildings instead of um oh the the
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
conquered buildings instead of some
 
05:38:16.030 --> 05:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
other me mechanism um the bill ended up
 
05:38:17.350 --> 05:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
deciding that they were going to heat
 
05:38:19.190 --> 05:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
the buildings with natural gas so they
 
05:38:23.110 --> 05:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
bought $25 million worth of gas uh
 
05:38:25.430 --> 05:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
equipment and heating systems to heat
 
05:38:29.310 --> 05:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
these buildings um now when a carbon
 
05:38:31.030 --> 05:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
price price comes and the price of
 
05:38:35.070 --> 05:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
natural gas starts to rise rapidly um
 
05:38:37.788 --> 05:38:37.798 align:start position:0%
that decision may turn out to be a poor
 
05:38:40.750 --> 05:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
one as far as the cost of heating these
 
05:38:43.150 --> 05:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
buildings um this equipment will
 
05:38:45.628 --> 05:38:45.638 align:start position:0%
probably become obsolete because of the
 
05:38:47.670 --> 05:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
cost of using it compared to other
 
05:38:49.070 --> 05:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
options and we're going to end up buying
 
05:38:52.270 --> 05:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
heat pumps earlier uh to replace them
 
05:38:53.670 --> 05:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
because that will be cheaper than
 
05:38:56.430 --> 05:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
continuing to use gas we can avoid
 
05:39:00.030 --> 05:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
making similar mistakes with our vehicle
 
05:39:02.548 --> 05:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
Tren vehicle purchases and our building
 
05:39:05.468 --> 05:39:05.478 align:start position:0%
heating purchases with this bill we're
 
05:39:08.390 --> 05:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
taking a conservative price it's the
 
05:39:11.628 --> 05:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
minimum of the experts price range to
 
05:39:13.390 --> 05:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
drive emissions down as needed to meet
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
the globally committed to targets and
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're not taxing anybody we're not
 
05:39:22.590 --> 05:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
spending extra money on something to do
 
05:39:24.788 --> 05:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
good we're taking a look at the chance
 
05:39:27.310 --> 05:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
of a federal carbon price coming down on
 
05:39:29.868 --> 05:39:29.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we are using using our
 
05:39:34.150 --> 05:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
insight to save money by purchasing
 
05:39:36.910 --> 05:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
things that will be cheaper to operate
 
05:39:38.468 --> 05:39:38.478 align:start position:0%
uh in the long
 
05:39:42.190 --> 05:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
run so a couple carbon pricing signals
 
05:39:45.070 --> 05:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
um there's some graphs in this document
 
05:39:47.150 --> 05:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
you can see there's 73 countries and
 
05:39:49.070 --> 05:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
regions that are pricing carbon now
 
05:39:53.190 --> 05:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
that's on the bottom of page two um page
 
05:39:56.070 --> 05:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
three has some of the prices Canada is
 
05:39:58.948 --> 05:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
using carbon Fe and dividend and they
 
05:40:02.990 --> 05:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
will be at $135 per ton in 2030 they're
 
05:40:05.230 --> 05:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
Rising $15 a year and they're rebating
 
05:40:08.190 --> 05:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
all the money back to Canadian citizens
 
05:40:10.468 --> 05:40:10.478 align:start position:0%
um and then the bottom of page three is
 
05:40:12.708 --> 05:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
the EU that's a cap and trade system
 
05:40:14.230 --> 05:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
which I don't recommend because you can
 
05:40:16.868 --> 05:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
see what it does to the price business
 
05:40:19.230 --> 05:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
is like a predictable price so a
 
05:40:21.990 --> 05:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
steadily Rising fee um is what we are
 
05:40:24.548 --> 05:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
advocating Congress to and fully rebed
 
05:40:27.430 --> 05:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
back to households to protect households
 
05:40:29.788 --> 05:40:29.798 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to give you my insight as
 
05:40:32.788 --> 05:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
a almost eight-year um volunteer with
 
05:40:35.190 --> 05:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
citizens climate Lobby um we have some
 
05:40:38.270 --> 05:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
of the best economists um working with
 
05:40:40.670 --> 05:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
us and we listen to The Experts and we
 
05:40:41.948 --> 05:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
get informed about what's going on in
 
05:40:44.430 --> 05:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
the world I wanted to share some of what
 
05:40:46.788 --> 05:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
I've been learning um from that
 
05:40:48.990 --> 05:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
organization with you so that you can
 
05:40:52.590 --> 05:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
help reduce my taxes in the future and
 
05:40:54.948 --> 05:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
the benefit of this is that sometimes
 
05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's a trade-off between the economy and
 
05:40:57.120 --> 05:40:57.830 align:start position:0%
it's a trade-off between the economy and
the

05:40:57.830 --> 05:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:41:00.750 --> 05:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
environment this bill is a trade-off
 
05:41:03.350 --> 05:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
between helping the economy saving
 
05:41:05.310 --> 05:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars and helping the
 
05:41:08.070 --> 05:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
environment and doing the opposite
 
05:41:10.270 --> 05:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
wasting taxpayer dollars buying
 
05:41:11.350 --> 05:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
equipment that's going to become
 
05:41:14.270 --> 05:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
obsolete before it's time uh and
 
05:41:17.070 --> 05:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
allowing our state to uh produce more of
 
05:41:18.750 --> 05:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
it more than its fair share of pollution
 
05:41:18.760 --> 05:41:21.030 align:start position:0%
it more than its fair share of pollution
going

05:41:21.030 --> 05:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
forward thank you for your testimony are
 
05:41:25.150 --> 05:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
05:41:25.160 --> 05:41:28.230 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
representative

05:41:28.230 --> 05:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:28.240 --> 05:41:30.190 align:start position:0%
 
Schmidt

05:41:30.190 --> 05:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
05:41:32.070 --> 05:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
being here John so which committee did
 
05:41:38.990 --> 05:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
you testify before uh previously oh I
 
05:41:40.750 --> 05:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
can't remember the name of it actually I
 
05:41:42.510 --> 05:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
did show up in the conquered monitor
 
05:41:44.190 --> 05:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
they got my name wrong oh they got my
 
05:41:45.590 --> 05:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
town wrong they said John Gage from
 
05:41:48.548 --> 05:41:48.558 align:start position:0%
Lincoln from Windham uh I can look that
 
05:41:51.310 --> 05:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
up for you though repres representative
 
05:41:53.990 --> 05:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
well well it was this in the last couple
 
05:41:55.350 --> 05:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
of years because I've been on this
 
05:41:58.310 --> 05:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
committee for 18 years uh and it wasn't
 
05:42:00.590 --> 05:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
this committee you were for it was I
 
05:42:03.948 --> 05:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
would guess it probably Commerce uh
 
05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
where or maybe Finance uh but probably
 
05:42:09.190 --> 05:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
Commerce because it seems like it's a
 
05:42:10.910 --> 05:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
Commerce kind of Bill it certainly is
 
05:42:14.110 --> 05:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
not our kind of Bill no yeah U more
 
05:42:16.628 --> 05:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
likely it's legislative Administration
 
05:42:18.150 --> 05:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
yeah no sorry I wasn't trying to blame
 
05:42:19.708 --> 05:42:19.718 align:start position:0%
this committee I was just using it as an
 
05:42:22.628 --> 05:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
example of uh a case where the the the
 
05:42:25.030 --> 05:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
state bought $25 million of equipment
 
05:42:27.110 --> 05:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
that is going to be obsolete uh and
 
05:42:29.750 --> 05:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
replaced before it's turned out to have
 
05:42:32.030 --> 05:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
saved the state money all right thank
 
05:42:36.548 --> 05:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
you follow up followup so uh but the
 
05:42:39.150 --> 05:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
thing is that this is not the kind of
 
05:42:40.990 --> 05:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
Bill we ordinarily deal with and so
 
05:42:44.510 --> 05:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to Grapple with the uh the
 
05:42:48.070 --> 05:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
very concept that the bill you know puts
 
05:42:51.230 --> 05:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
before us but also the presentations
 
05:42:53.750 --> 05:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
that we heard from the sponsor and from
 
05:42:57.468 --> 05:42:57.478 align:start position:0%
Professor wheen uh and it's a
 
05:42:59.948 --> 05:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
dramatically different approach in in
 
05:43:03.110 --> 05:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
each case you're a practical politician
 
05:43:05.670 --> 05:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
in a way or practical Economist and
 
05:43:07.948 --> 05:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
you're talking about something that
 
05:43:10.830 --> 05:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
legislators are used to considering at
 
05:43:13.868 --> 05:43:13.878 align:start position:0%
least um in the aggregate when we were
 
05:43:15.628 --> 05:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
hearing about on the house floor if not
 
05:43:18.750 --> 05:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
in committee um so your
 
05:43:21.910 --> 05:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
question the the question is uh and
 
05:43:25.150 --> 05:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
you've given us a some documentation
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
here which uh we we will certainly look
 
05:43:31.750 --> 05:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
at closely but the question is um how do
 
05:43:33.910 --> 05:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
we get our handle on it because we're
 
05:43:36.110 --> 05:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
going to be making a decision on this
 
05:43:38.430 --> 05:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
particular bill and I don't know whether
 
05:43:40.150 --> 05:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to go to a subcommittee
 
05:43:42.430 --> 05:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
because uh I haven't heard from the
 
05:43:45.830 --> 05:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
chair on that regard if it's if it will
 
05:43:48.548 --> 05:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
go it's assigned to representative gr's
 
05:43:50.948 --> 05:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if they choose to take it
 
05:43:53.350 --> 05:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
up that's where we'll deal with it okay
 
05:43:55.910 --> 05:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
would you be available to come before
 
05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee uh to talk about this
 
05:44:00.750 --> 05:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
because I think you have to wrestle with
 
05:44:03.670 --> 05:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
the with the details your approach is
 
05:44:06.150 --> 05:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
easy more easily grasped than I think
 
05:44:08.150 --> 05:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
than the previous testimony that we
 
05:44:10.590 --> 05:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
heard which was coming at it from a very
 
05:44:12.510 --> 05:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
different angle as you undoubtedly
 
05:44:14.350 --> 05:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
realized when you heard it yes I would
 
05:44:17.270 --> 05:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
be happy to uh come work with the
 
05:44:20.190 --> 05:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I um you
 
05:44:23.230 --> 05:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
know what we heard from the expert is
 
05:44:27.948 --> 05:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
correct uh and he also said to do that
 
05:44:30.350 --> 05:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
efficiently we need to charge the fossil
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
fuel industry a carbon tax um so that
 
05:44:37.270 --> 05:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
the cost of doing everything re is
 
05:44:39.548 --> 05:44:39.558 align:start position:0%
reflecting the price of pollution and
 
05:44:42.350 --> 05:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
those things um but that's not a state
 
05:44:44.430 --> 05:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
level thing uh we're working at that at
 
05:44:47.548 --> 05:44:47.558 align:start position:0%
the federal level um so how do we do
 
05:44:49.830 --> 05:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
this pragmatically at the State uh we
 
05:44:51.548 --> 05:44:51.558 align:start position:0%
don't have to get the price right but we
 
05:44:51.558 --> 05:44:53.868 align:start position:0%
don't have to get the price right but we
should

05:44:53.868 --> 05:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:58.110 --> 05:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
be uh anticipating some price and if we
 
05:45:00.910 --> 05:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
anticipate too much of a price according
 
05:45:01.948 --> 05:45:01.958 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:45:04.230 --> 05:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
ipcc the world is not going to meet its
 
05:45:06.510 --> 05:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
targets so they might start low but then
 
05:45:07.708 --> 05:45:07.718 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to raise those
 
05:45:09.708 --> 05:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
prices uh to drive emissions down as
 
05:45:13.030 --> 05:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
they as they want uh if we do it too low
 
05:45:14.590 --> 05:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
we've saved some money but we haven't
 
05:45:17.190 --> 05:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
saved as much as we might have um if we
 
05:45:20.270 --> 05:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
do it too high we'll R we reduce more
 
05:45:22.708 --> 05:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
pollution that will cost us a little
 
05:45:26.310 --> 05:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
more than our cheapest um option but I
 
05:45:27.510 --> 05:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
think people in New Hampshire wouldn't
 
05:45:29.190 --> 05:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
mind making a mistake and reducing in a
 
05:45:32.070 --> 05:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
little more pollution than optimal uh
 
05:45:34.590 --> 05:45:34.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm confident this is a low price
 
05:45:37.430 --> 05:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
because the IP uh sorry the EPA just
 
05:45:38.910 --> 05:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
came out with a new social cost of
 
05:45:43.110 --> 05:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide emissions at $190 per ton
 
05:45:45.750 --> 05:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
um that's up from about
 
05:45:49.750 --> 05:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
$5 five or six years ago um the longer
 
05:45:51.788 --> 05:45:51.798 align:start position:0%
the world takes to put a price on carbon
 
05:45:54.070 --> 05:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere the higher the Target price
 
05:45:55.590 --> 05:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
is because we haven't been reducing
 
05:45:58.310 --> 05:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
emissions in the meantime uh it's a a
 
05:46:00.948 --> 05:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
scale where the longer you wait the more
 
05:46:03.270 --> 05:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to cost
 
05:46:07.590 --> 05:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you refen Simon thank you
 
05:46:09.548 --> 05:46:09.558 align:start position:0%
madam chair so this was uh the
 
05:46:11.150 --> 05:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
information that I believe I asked
 
05:46:14.670 --> 05:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
representative ger for where this comes
 
05:46:17.670 --> 05:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
where where your numbers come from um
 
05:46:19.670 --> 05:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
and if I understood you correctly you're
 
05:46:21.468 --> 05:46:21.478 align:start position:0%
saying that essentially what this
 
05:46:23.628 --> 05:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
calculation took into effect was where
 
05:46:26.868 --> 05:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
we wanted to see temperature uh
 
05:46:29.468 --> 05:46:29.478 align:start position:0%
percentage increase over time then we
 
05:46:31.190 --> 05:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
took the amount of fossil fuels that we
 
05:46:32.948 --> 05:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
were burning or whatever and we figured
 
05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
out what the tax needed to be to keep
 
05:46:37.670 --> 05:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
our global warming at a certain rate is
 
05:46:39.468 --> 05:46:39.478 align:start position:0%
that correct did I hear you correctly on
 
05:46:41.990 --> 05:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
that the ipcc special report on one and
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
a half degrees of warming came out with
 
05:46:46.190 --> 05:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
these numbers based on what you said
 
05:46:48.910 --> 05:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
yeah they've calculated and this is only
 
05:46:51.628 --> 05:46:51.638 align:start position:0%
half of the solution to reduce emissions
 
05:46:54.110 --> 05:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's in addition to pricing
 
05:46:56.350 --> 05:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
pollution because we're starting 30
 
05:46:59.270 --> 05:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
years too late we we now have to do
 
05:47:01.310 --> 05:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
complimentary policies to pick up the
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
rest of the slack um the price range is
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
so big because there's other variables
 
05:47:08.510 --> 05:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
also the the natural price of fossil
 
05:47:10.430 --> 05:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
fuels varies because of market
 
05:47:12.948 --> 05:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
conditions um the rate of economic
 
05:47:14.990 --> 05:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
growth varies um there's a lot of
 
05:47:18.070 --> 05:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
unknowns so picking the minimum we know
 
05:47:19.510 --> 05:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to be too low because
 
05:47:22.430 --> 05:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a terrible economy a very
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
high fossil fuel prices which probably
 
05:47:28.190 --> 05:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go together um and so you know
 
05:47:29.910 --> 05:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
we are being being conservative with
 
05:47:34.390 --> 05:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
these numbers um including with the us
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
epa's estimate of the social cost of
 
05:47:40.670 --> 05:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
carbon at $190 per ton um we'll get
 
05:47:42.590 --> 05:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
there eventually but but by the time
 
05:47:47.468 --> 05:47:47.478 align:start position:0%
we're at $190 a ton rising at a $10 per
 
05:47:50.390 --> 05:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
year rate um the US government will have
 
05:47:52.948 --> 05:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
adjusted that upwards again I'm sure
 
05:47:55.390 --> 05:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Dolan and then
 
05:47:55.400 --> 05:47:57.628 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Dolan and then
represent

05:47:57.628 --> 05:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:48:01.110 --> 05:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you madam chair
 
05:48:03.868 --> 05:48:03.878 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to say that what I'm
 
05:48:05.830 --> 05:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
hearing is a lot of so attempts at
 
05:48:05.840 --> 05:48:07.110 align:start position:0%
hearing is a lot of so attempts at
Social

05:48:07.110 --> 05:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
Social
 
05:48:10.708 --> 05:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
Engineering and uh and what happens when
 
05:48:12.510 --> 05:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
you do that you're what you're actually
 
05:48:14.150 --> 05:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
trying to do is you're driving
 
05:48:16.110 --> 05:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
electrification let's Electrify
 
05:48:19.150 --> 05:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
everything I have a my question is in
 
05:48:21.468 --> 05:48:21.478 align:start position:0%
your various charts and Analysis have
 
05:48:23.510 --> 05:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
you have you started to consider the
 
05:48:27.030 --> 05:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
stress on our electric grid that's
 
05:48:29.070 --> 05:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
struggling mightily to keep up with all
 
05:48:32.548 --> 05:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
this electrification we know that's my
 
05:48:36.030 --> 05:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
main question but our objective evidence
 
05:48:38.390 --> 05:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
is that California's a ahead of us
 
05:48:40.190 --> 05:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me ahead of us with this and
 
05:48:42.510 --> 05:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
they're having rolling blackouts brown
 
05:48:45.548 --> 05:48:45.558 align:start position:0%
outs mandates don't charge your electric
 
05:48:47.750 --> 05:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles because we can't the electric
 
05:48:50.510 --> 05:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
grid can't handle it what have you what
 
05:48:52.830 --> 05:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
have you done to analyze the stress on
 
05:48:54.590 --> 05:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
electric grid to be able to handle
 
05:48:57.190 --> 05:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
initiatives like this yeah there's a lot
 
05:48:59.390 --> 05:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
of work going on right now with
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
permitting reform um in Congress um
 
05:49:06.430 --> 05:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
because the inflation reduction act
 
05:49:08.548 --> 05:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
subsidies have opened up the floodgates
 
05:49:12.350 --> 05:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
to uh produ to generate clean energy now
 
05:49:14.670 --> 05:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
the problem is there's not power lines
 
05:49:16.270 --> 05:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
to go from where we can generate clean
 
05:49:18.830 --> 05:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
energy to where we need it um Congress
 
05:49:20.948 --> 05:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
has to change some pering rules New
 
05:49:22.230 --> 05:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire may have some pering rules
 
05:49:24.628 --> 05:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
that need to be o open up to make those
 
05:49:26.948 --> 05:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
things possible we have New Hampshire is
 
05:49:28.910 --> 05:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
in a good situation that we have a lot
 
05:49:32.150 --> 05:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
of lines coming from seabook and there's
 
05:49:35.270 --> 05:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of wind off the coast that we can
 
05:49:37.390 --> 05:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
bring power into to where the sebr lines
 
05:49:41.670 --> 05:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
start from um but I you know I'm not an
 
05:49:44.110 --> 05:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
expert I would say from a New Hampshire
 
05:49:47.830 --> 05:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
perspective uh Independence is important
 
05:49:50.350 --> 05:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
and I would like to see the state focus
 
05:49:52.708 --> 05:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
on helping people become energy
 
05:49:56.110 --> 05:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
independent themselves uh a a household
 
05:49:59.910 --> 05:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
battery and solar panels um can make you
 
05:50:02.190 --> 05:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
you know independent when you have a an
 
05:50:05.390 --> 05:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
ice storm um you know so we could help
 
05:50:08.868 --> 05:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
people um produce energy locally in
 
05:50:12.788 --> 05:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
micro grids um on over parking lots over
 
05:50:15.270 --> 05:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
buildings uh I I don't think this is
 
05:50:18.030 --> 05:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
social engineering as professor willan
 
05:50:20.430 --> 05:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
said we have a market failure when
 
05:50:24.030 --> 05:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
there's free pollution um the right cost
 
05:50:27.788 --> 05:50:27.798 align:start position:0%
incentives are not aligned and so we're
 
05:50:30.150 --> 05:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
we're not manipulating people into doing
 
05:50:33.070 --> 05:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
what we want them to do we are
 
05:50:35.548 --> 05:50:35.558 align:start position:0%
reflecting the true costs of using the
 
05:50:38.230 --> 05:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
different energy options in the price of
 
05:50:40.990 --> 05:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
of those options so we get an efficient
 
05:50:43.548 --> 05:50:43.558 align:start position:0%
market we get you know car carbon fee
 
05:50:45.788 --> 05:50:45.798 align:start position:0%
and dividend is the tax the fossil fuel
 
05:50:48.070 --> 05:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
industry for its pollution of a polluter
 
05:50:49.708 --> 05:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
fee and rebate the money back to
 
05:50:51.830 --> 05:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
households this addresses a market
 
05:50:55.190 --> 05:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
failure in the most costeffective way we
 
05:50:58.030 --> 05:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
we just correct the prices so that
 
05:51:00.510 --> 05:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
buyers and sellers and investors can
 
05:51:02.430 --> 05:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
make more fully informed decisions based
 
05:51:04.548 --> 05:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
on price you don't have to know climate
 
05:51:06.590 --> 05:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
science to figure out whether the Tomato
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
from Chile is better to buy than the
 
05:51:10.350 --> 05:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
Tomato from down the street the one from
 
05:51:11.948 --> 05:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
Chile will be more expensive because it
 
05:51:15.190 --> 05:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
had to fly here um getting the prices
 
05:51:17.548 --> 05:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
right frees everybody from trying to
 
05:51:18.910 --> 05:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
figure out what the right thing to do is
 
05:51:20.310 --> 05:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
you look for the cheapest thing and
 
05:51:22.390 --> 05:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
that's the right thing to do um you
 
05:51:24.628 --> 05:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
don't have to tell Banks not to you know
 
05:51:26.670 --> 05:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
loan money to fossil fuel industry they
 
05:51:29.310 --> 05:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
see huge risk those those those giant
 
05:51:31.750 --> 05:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
projects will not pay off because clean
 
05:51:34.230 --> 05:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
energy projects will be more profitable
 
05:51:36.990 --> 05:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
um when there's when we truly reflect
 
05:51:38.990 --> 05:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
the costs of the different
 
05:51:43.910 --> 05:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
options if you one followup our
 
05:51:45.750 --> 05:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
constituents I'm
 
05:51:49.590 --> 05:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
sorry our constituents
 
05:51:53.548 --> 05:51:53.558 align:start position:0%
um aren't that concerned about the price
 
05:51:57.948 --> 05:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
of whatever carbon uh thing this is
 
05:52:00.230 --> 05:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to work out to be when their when
 
05:52:02.510 --> 05:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
their power is out their electric power
 
05:52:04.548 --> 05:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
is out and we have a lot of outages in
 
05:52:08.310 --> 05:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because of the weather and
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative Dolan this bill
 
05:52:14.190 --> 05:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
is not about the electric grid and it's
 
05:52:17.150 --> 05:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh you're going way off Target on this
 
05:52:20.030 --> 05:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
let me bring it back um be happy to talk
 
05:52:21.708 --> 05:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
talk with you afterwards about it I'm
 
05:52:23.230 --> 05:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
I'm very interested in the problem
 
05:52:24.830 --> 05:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
you're right it's not not relevant to
 
05:52:27.948 --> 05:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
this one um this particular bill but it
 
05:52:29.708 --> 05:52:29.718 align:start position:0%
we we we do need to do work in parallel
 
05:52:31.670 --> 05:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
with all of these things I there's no
 
05:52:33.070 --> 05:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
one thing that's going to solve
 
05:52:34.628 --> 05:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
everything we just want I want to save
 
05:52:36.868 --> 05:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
the state money that's what this bill is
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
really about is thank you I know some
 
05:52:40.750 --> 05:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
things about what's going on with carbon
 
05:52:42.030 --> 05:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
pricing around the world I want to share
 
05:52:43.990 --> 05:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
it with the state so that the state can
 
05:52:46.910 --> 05:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
make um strategic decisions to save
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars thank you
 
05:52:51.548 --> 05:52:51.558 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt in my opinion I
 
05:52:52.990 --> 05:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
think we're wasting our time at the
 
05:52:55.110 --> 05:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
moment what we need to do is get to to
 
05:52:57.670 --> 05:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee where we can get to the
 
05:52:58.830 --> 05:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
the det
 
05:53:00.590 --> 05:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
because we're we're all over the place
 
05:53:03.750 --> 05:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
here great lack of understanding we need
 
05:53:06.110 --> 05:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
to get to subcommittee hearings are very
 
05:53:07.548 --> 05:53:07.558 align:start position:0%
inefficient in terms of dealing with
 
05:53:07.558 --> 05:53:08.750 align:start position:0%
inefficient in terms of dealing with
their

05:53:08.750 --> 05:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:53:12.590 --> 05:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
problem thank you representative
 
05:53:14.910 --> 05:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
Brown uh would you like me to go ahead
 
05:53:17.110 --> 05:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
or would you prefer to go that way no
 
05:53:22.628 --> 05:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
he's he's set his piece okay
 
05:53:25.190 --> 05:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
um couple questions about some things
 
05:53:28.270 --> 05:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
that you said why uh why is equipment
 
05:53:30.548 --> 05:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
going to become obsolete you buy a
 
05:53:32.110 --> 05:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
diesel truck it's going to become
 
05:53:35.270 --> 05:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
obsolete before it's worn out could you
 
05:53:37.030 --> 05:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
explain that yeah it's going to become
 
05:53:40.830 --> 05:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
more expensive to operate than buying a
 
05:53:42.628 --> 05:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle that will be much
 
05:53:45.190 --> 05:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
cheaper to operate over a period of
 
05:53:47.830 --> 05:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me sorry I'm sorry his his
 
05:53:50.670 --> 05:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
assumption is that the at some point the
 
05:53:52.590 --> 05:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
federal government will impose a carbon
 
05:53:54.788 --> 05:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
tax and therefore the cost of fossil
 
05:53:56.030 --> 05:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
fuels will
 
05:53:59.150 --> 05:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
increase so follow up followup the
 
05:54:01.030 --> 05:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle won't be obsolete but
 
05:54:04.468 --> 05:54:04.478 align:start position:0%
it's paying to operate it will be cost
 
05:54:06.110 --> 05:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
prohibitive is that better that's a
 
05:54:08.350 --> 05:54:08.360 align:start position:0%
better way to term it yes and and that's
 
05:54:10.110 --> 05:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
basically what this Bill is saying we
 
05:54:12.868 --> 05:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
want to you know account for the the
 
05:54:15.990 --> 05:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
cost of operating these things over time
 
05:54:19.590 --> 05:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
um building in a price on carbon um
 
05:54:21.390 --> 05:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
because it's like it's increasingly
 
05:54:24.430 --> 05:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
likely um and so by anticipating that it
 
05:54:26.830 --> 05:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
may be we'll be buying diesel trucks
 
05:54:28.708 --> 05:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
because there's no other options
 
05:54:33.230 --> 05:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
um so but uh a sedan that somebody is
 
05:54:37.110 --> 05:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
driving 100 miles round trip a day um we
 
05:54:38.788 --> 05:54:38.798 align:start position:0%
can save money I I just bought an
 
05:54:41.670 --> 05:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle four weeks ago and I
 
05:54:43.430 --> 05:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
did a cost accounting
 
05:54:46.390 --> 05:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
myself what is the what is the cheapest
 
05:54:47.788 --> 05:54:47.798 align:start position:0%
way to do the traveling that I want to
 
05:54:49.910 --> 05:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
do I wasn't looking at my carbon
 
05:54:51.750 --> 05:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
footprint I was looking at the cost of
 
05:54:54.070 --> 05:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
ownership of this car I hold on to cars
 
05:54:56.430 --> 05:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
for 10 years what is it going to cost me
 
05:54:58.548 --> 05:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
and there's a break even point
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
uh after several years an electric
 
05:55:02.548 --> 05:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
vehicle and then you're saving money
 
05:55:04.390 --> 05:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
because electricity is so much cheaper
 
05:55:08.190 --> 05:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
per mile than gasoline now if we if
 
05:55:10.548 --> 05:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
federal government prices carbon while I
 
05:55:12.548 --> 05:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
own this vehicle I'll have even saved
 
05:55:12.558 --> 05:55:13.788 align:start position:0%
own this vehicle I'll have even saved
more

05:55:13.788 --> 05:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:55:17.788 --> 05:55:17.798 align:start position:0%
money thank you follow one A different
 
05:55:20.030 --> 05:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
question if I
 
05:55:23.070 --> 05:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
might uh you also mentioned free
 
05:55:25.788 --> 05:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
pollution and could you could you expand
 
05:55:27.670 --> 05:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
on that a little bit and the reason I
 
05:55:30.468 --> 05:55:30.478 align:start position:0%
asked is we have the Clean Water Act we
 
05:55:33.070 --> 05:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
have the Clean Air Act we have uh
 
05:55:34.708 --> 05:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
requirements on Wastewater we have
 
05:55:37.830 --> 05:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
requirements on power plants that they
 
05:55:41.070 --> 05:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
have to do X Y and Z to manage their
 
05:55:44.548 --> 05:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
pollution so I I want to know what you
 
05:55:47.030 --> 05:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
mean by you think there's free pollution
 
05:55:50.110 --> 05:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
yeah sure um human civilization has
 
05:55:52.788 --> 05:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
increased carbon dioxide by 50% in the
 
05:55:55.030 --> 05:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
air since the Industrial Revolution half
 
05:55:57.430 --> 05:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
of that in the last 30 years if you look
 
05:56:00.788 --> 05:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
at the 10,000 year um chart of carbon
 
05:56:03.468 --> 05:56:03.478 align:start position:0%
dioxide it it was 280 parts per million
 
05:56:06.110 --> 05:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
until 150 years ago and now it's 50%
 
05:56:09.110 --> 05:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
more of that and it shot up rapidly this
 
05:56:10.868 --> 05:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
is pollution we're changing the chemical
 
05:56:14.270 --> 05:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
and physical nature of our world and
 
05:56:16.910 --> 05:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's costing us in many ways um
 
05:56:19.510 --> 05:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
stronger storms more flooding droughts
 
05:56:21.990 --> 05:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
heat waves fires these are worse now
 
05:56:25.670 --> 05:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
they're more expensive um the cost the
 
05:56:28.628 --> 05:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
IMF estimates the sub subsidies that we
 
05:56:30.868 --> 05:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
give the fossil fuel industry both
 
05:56:33.990 --> 05:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
direct and indirect uh to be7 trillion
 
05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
dollar a year globally and hundreds of
 
05:56:39.110 --> 05:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars in the US most of
 
05:56:41.350 --> 05:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
them are not explicit subsidies for oil
 
05:56:43.670 --> 05:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
depletion allowances and things like
 
05:56:46.548 --> 05:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
that they're implicit subsidies of the
 
05:56:49.310 --> 05:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
damages from the pollution that we as a
 
05:56:52.430 --> 05:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
society have to pay after the fact and
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
these include um personal risk uh health
 
05:57:00.708 --> 05:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
problems um insurance going up uh were
 
05:57:05.190 --> 05:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know the national flood insurance um
 
05:57:08.350 --> 05:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
were were socially um paying more and
 
05:57:11.830 --> 05:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
more from the impacts of the pollution
 
05:57:14.310 --> 05:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
the carbon dioxide pollution from fossil
 
05:57:17.670 --> 05:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
fuels this is free it's a subsidy to the
 
05:57:19.830 --> 05:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel industry right now we are
 
05:57:21.468 --> 05:57:21.478 align:start position:0%
giving the fossil fuel industry a
 
05:57:23.430 --> 05:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
subsidy and we were paying the
 
05:57:27.990 --> 05:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
consequences later so situation is that
 
05:57:31.230 --> 05:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
the carbon dioxide has not been declared
 
05:57:34.190 --> 05:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
a pollutant in the sense that it is
 
05:57:36.030 --> 05:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
affected by the Clean Air Act or the
 
05:57:39.070 --> 05:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
Clean Water Act therefore there's
 
05:57:43.788 --> 05:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
no regulatory control yeah and until
 
05:57:46.070 --> 05:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
citizens united uh this was not a
 
05:57:49.510 --> 05:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
partisan issue um George HW Bush
 
05:57:51.788 --> 05:57:51.798 align:start position:0%
campaigned on the White House Effect
 
05:57:54.350 --> 05:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
will take care of the greenhouse effect
 
05:57:57.548 --> 05:57:57.558 align:start position:0%
um the fossil fuel industry has confused
 
05:58:01.468 --> 05:58:01.478 align:start position:0%
um the media and manipulated us into not
 
05:58:04.070 --> 05:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
being sure what to do they've just been
 
05:58:07.548 --> 05:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
delaying uh sensible legislation to call
 
05:58:10.590 --> 05:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
a spade a spade CO2 emissions from
 
05:58:12.788 --> 05:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
breathing are not pollution we that's
 
05:58:15.510 --> 05:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
part of the short-term carbon cycle CO2
 
05:58:16.990 --> 05:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
from carbon that we dig out of the
 
05:58:18.350 --> 05:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
ground that was put there millions of
 
05:58:21.230 --> 05:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
years ago when there was a lot more CO2
 
05:58:22.910 --> 05:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
in the air but now it's underground
 
05:58:24.310 --> 05:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're putting it back up in the air
 
05:58:27.468 --> 05:58:27.478 align:start position:0%
we're changing the physical nature of
 
05:58:29.830 --> 05:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
our atmosphere and that's changing the
 
05:58:32.830 --> 05:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
physical nature of the surface of the
 
05:58:34.788 --> 05:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
Earth and the oceans and this is costing
 
05:58:37.750 --> 05:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
us dearly you know not just in dollars
 
05:58:40.788 --> 05:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
but biodiversity loss ecological system
 
05:58:43.910 --> 05:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh degradation you know in our own New
 
05:58:45.910 --> 05:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way of living with the ski
 
05:58:47.830 --> 05:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
industry and and snowmobiling we're
 
05:58:51.070 --> 05:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
losing our Winters uh on both ends and
 
05:58:52.750 --> 05:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
it's Winters coming later and it's
 
05:58:54.708 --> 05:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
ending earlier and it's more variable in
 
05:58:56.868 --> 05:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
the middle uh these are costs of
 
05:59:00.590 --> 05:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
pollution um because uh we knew from
 
05:59:03.150 --> 05:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
science decades ago this would happen it
 
05:59:05.670 --> 05:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
is starting to happen now we can see it
 
05:59:07.750 --> 05:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's why at the federal level we
 
05:59:09.350 --> 05:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
need to price carbon and use border
 
05:59:11.510 --> 05:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
carbon adjustments to push our carbon
 
05:59:12.868 --> 05:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
price around the world and whole free
 
05:59:15.270 --> 05:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
polluting countries accountable this
 
05:59:17.750 --> 05:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
will help put a price on pollution
 
05:59:19.150 --> 05:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
around the world that's what I work on
 
05:59:22.270 --> 05:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
in my day volunteer job um what I'm
 
05:59:23.990 --> 05:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do for you is what I've
 
05:59:26.910 --> 05:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
learned is it's quite likely carbon
 
05:59:28.430 --> 05:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
pricing is coming
 
05:59:31.270 --> 05:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
um I want to save our state some money I
 
05:59:33.788 --> 05:59:33.798 align:start position:0%
want to save some tax dollars I want you
 
05:59:35.670 --> 05:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
guys to make good decisions that that
 
05:59:37.788 --> 05:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
are fiscally responsible and they have
 
05:59:39.750 --> 05:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
the side benefit of reducing pollution
 
05:59:41.350 --> 05:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
which I think all of us would like to
 
05:59:45.468 --> 05:59:45.478 align:start position:0%
reduce taxes and have a clean New
 
05:59:47.830 --> 05:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for your concern are
 
05:59:49.070 --> 05:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
there any
 
05:59:51.468 --> 05:59:51.478 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:56.558 --> 06:00:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:00:06.310 --> 06:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:09.628 --> 06:00:09.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Barbara Souther I'm
 
06:00:12.670 --> 06:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
from Bradford New Hampshire and I just
 
06:00:12.680 --> 06:00:13.628 align:start position:0%
from Bradford New Hampshire and I just
want

06:00:13.628 --> 06:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
want
 
06:00:18.070 --> 06:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
to ask this committee if you would
 
06:00:21.868 --> 06:00:21.878 align:start position:0%
please not be shortsighted on this I
 
06:00:23.788 --> 06:00:23.798 align:start position:0%
know it seems to be human nature to be
 
06:00:28.468 --> 06:00:28.478 align:start position:0%
shortsighted we do that all the time but
 
06:00:31.468 --> 06:00:31.478 align:start position:0%
we really need to think about the future
 
06:00:33.430 --> 06:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
because we're in a
 
06:00:36.628 --> 06:00:36.638 align:start position:0%
fantastically huge transm transition
 
06:00:40.468 --> 06:00:40.478 align:start position:0%
right now not just in New Hampshire but
 
06:00:42.788 --> 06:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
the whole United States and the whole
 
06:00:45.548 --> 06:00:45.558 align:start position:0%
all the countries the whole globe we're
 
06:00:49.910 --> 06:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
really moving fast and so we need to
 
06:00:52.230 --> 06:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
take a lot of things in con into
 
06:00:54.270 --> 06:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
consideration that we didn't used to
 
06:00:56.910 --> 06:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
take into consideration like when your
 
06:00:59.670 --> 06:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
purchases something you know you want to
 
06:01:02.070 --> 06:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
you want to take into consideration not
 
06:01:04.830 --> 06:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
what it costs today but what is it going
 
06:01:09.350 --> 06:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
to cost in three years five years 10
 
06:01:12.430 --> 06:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
years because if you don't you're going
 
06:01:14.830 --> 06:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
to pay for it you're going to have to
 
06:01:18.468 --> 06:01:18.478 align:start position:0%
retrofit all kinds of things and and uh
 
06:01:22.468 --> 06:01:22.478 align:start position:0%
get new new vehicles new new heat pumps
 
06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
like John was saying and
 
06:01:28.868 --> 06:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's just very important to
 
06:01:32.070 --> 06:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
think about all of these
 
06:01:35.548 --> 06:01:35.558 align:start position:0%
factors that's really all I need to say
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
please please think about the
 
06:01:40.548 --> 06:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
future thank you for Testimony
 
06:01:43.750 --> 06:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative gold hi hi it's nice to
 
06:01:45.670 --> 06:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
see you here I'm glad you made it down
 
06:01:47.390 --> 06:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
from Bradford and I've enjoyed our
 
06:01:49.910 --> 06:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
conversations on this topic and I just
 
06:01:53.948 --> 06:01:53.958 align:start position:0%
want to thank you well thank you for
 
06:01:55.990 --> 06:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
serving other
 
06:01:58.590 --> 06:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
questions don't see y thank you've been
 
06:01:58.600 --> 06:02:01.310 align:start position:0%
questions don't see y thank you've been
very

06:02:01.310 --> 06:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:11.190 --> 06:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:14.310 --> 06:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
Payne Hi H I'll just try to uh bring up
 
06:02:16.548 --> 06:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
a few things that others have mentioned
 
06:02:21.030 --> 06:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
um so first um Professor whan mentioned
 
06:02:24.430 --> 06:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh that um well just the starting
 
06:02:27.590 --> 06:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
principle is that no one wakes up up in
 
06:02:29.590 --> 06:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
the morning and says they want to burn
 
06:02:32.830 --> 06:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
as much coal or consume emit as much CO2
 
06:02:35.310 --> 06:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
as possible no one does that they wake
 
06:02:36.868 --> 06:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
up thinking they want to get someplace
 
06:02:38.230 --> 06:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
they want to keep their house warm in
 
06:02:40.390 --> 06:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
the winter and cool in the summer they
 
06:02:41.990 --> 06:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
maybe want to have some fun maybe they
 
06:02:44.150 --> 06:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
want to fly somewhere and they want to
 
06:02:48.468 --> 06:02:48.478 align:start position:0%
buy things that are made using energy so
 
06:02:51.948 --> 06:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
um the key point is that we buy things
 
06:02:54.590 --> 06:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
on price and the reason people use
 
06:02:57.070 --> 06:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels and have for about 200
 
06:02:59.548 --> 06:02:59.558 align:start position:0%
years now is that they're very
 
06:03:01.910 --> 06:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
convenient they're energy dense and
 
06:03:06.390 --> 06:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
they're very cheap um so but they but
 
06:03:08.590 --> 06:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
they they're only cheap as Professor
 
06:03:10.030 --> 06:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
Willam pointed out because we're not
 
06:03:12.868 --> 06:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
paying the costs of them so I filled up
 
06:03:15.548 --> 06:03:15.558 align:start position:0%
my car works out great for me works out
 
06:03:18.110 --> 06:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
for Exxon Mobile not so great for my
 
06:03:20.110 --> 06:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
kids even worse if I were to have
 
06:03:22.548 --> 06:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
grandkids um even worse where I to live
 
06:03:22.558 --> 06:03:23.468 align:start position:0%
grandkids um even worse where I to live
in

06:03:23.468 --> 06:03:23.478 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:03:26.868 --> 06:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
Bangladesh um which I would not argue as
 
06:03:29.110 --> 06:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
a political point in this country uh but
 
06:03:30.750 --> 06:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
it'll be worse for everyone including
 
06:03:32.708 --> 06:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire as John pointed
 
06:03:35.548 --> 06:03:35.558 align:start position:0%
out we're losing our winners um we're
 
06:03:38.070 --> 06:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
getting just incredible numbers of ticks
 
06:03:41.548 --> 06:03:41.558 align:start position:0%
in the summer and spring and fall so so
 
06:03:45.150 --> 06:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
the the the key the key thing to do is
 
06:03:48.670 --> 06:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
to make fossil fuels include those costs
 
06:03:51.868 --> 06:03:51.878 align:start position:0%
that are going to be borne by people in
 
06:03:54.510 --> 06:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
the future who are not here to vote on
 
06:03:57.430 --> 06:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
it um and there are two ways you can do
 
06:04:00.070 --> 06:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
that you can either put the fee on on
 
06:04:02.030 --> 06:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
carbon which of course is the most
 
06:04:04.070 --> 06:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
efficient way to do it or you can
 
06:04:06.190 --> 06:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
subsidize the
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
non-carbon uh uh sources of energy so
 
06:04:10.910 --> 06:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'll give give you just an example
 
06:04:12.310 --> 06:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
because a lot of this is very abstract
 
06:04:16.670 --> 06:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
so let's take uh cars um we've had for
 
06:04:19.110 --> 06:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
more than 10 years now a federal tax
 
06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
credit on EVS which pays uh which gives
 
06:04:26.708 --> 06:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
back in in in taxes owed 7500 bucks to
 
06:04:30.350 --> 06:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
people who buy a full electric vehicle
 
06:04:33.350 --> 06:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
and uh so let's look at what that means
 
06:04:37.030 --> 06:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of the price the implied price
 
06:04:41.310 --> 06:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
of carbon so if you buy a u a 21 Mile a
 
06:04:43.868 --> 06:04:43.878 align:start position:0%
gallon car and you drive at 11,000 miles
 
06:04:46.670 --> 06:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
a year that emits about five tons of
 
06:04:49.670 --> 06:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
carbon a year okay um that the average
 
06:04:52.830 --> 06:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
American emits about 16 tons a year so
 
06:04:56.030 --> 06:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
five of that is if they have a car um
 
06:04:58.430 --> 06:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
and let's say you keep that car for 15
 
06:05:00.910 --> 06:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
years which isn't you know the average
 
06:05:02.830 --> 06:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
life of a car in America is like 12 13
 
06:05:06.430 --> 06:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
years on the road so uh 5times 15 that's
 
06:05:09.390 --> 06:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
75 tons of carbon that are going to be
 
06:05:10.948 --> 06:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
emitted over the life of this
 
06:05:13.948 --> 06:05:13.958 align:start position:0%
conventional gas car getting 21 miles a
 
06:05:18.390 --> 06:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
gallon and conveniently the the federal
 
06:05:20.750 --> 06:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
EV credit was
 
06:05:23.468 --> 06:05:23.478 align:start position:0%
$7,500 and still is actually it's got
 
06:05:27.590 --> 06:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
some little uh adjustments but
 
06:05:29.230 --> 06:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
so so that means that the federal
 
06:05:31.670 --> 06:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
government is saying that it's worth
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
$100 a ton to
 
06:05:37.788 --> 06:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
avoid the emissions from a gas car by
 
06:05:42.430 --> 06:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
buying an EV card 75 5 time 15 is 7 75
 
06:05:46.190 --> 06:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
700 divid by 75 is
 
06:05:50.548 --> 06:05:50.558 align:start position:0%
$100 now that $100 a ton is in the
 
06:05:53.708 --> 06:05:53.718 align:start position:0%
ballpark of what experts consider the
 
06:05:57.030 --> 06:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
the uh social cost of carbon as people
 
06:05:58.670 --> 06:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
pointed out it could be
 
06:06:02.030 --> 06:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
195 could be 135 it's certainly way
 
06:06:03.868 --> 06:06:03.878 align:start position:0%
greater than zero as Professor whin
 
06:06:05.868 --> 06:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
argued and the only thing I'd say about
 
06:06:07.510 --> 06:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm not here to try to tell you
 
06:06:10.430 --> 06:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
what it is but there's a big debate
 
06:06:13.990 --> 06:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
right now um as to whether the adverse
 
06:06:16.510 --> 06:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
effects of climate change are in fact
 
06:06:19.948 --> 06:06:19.958 align:start position:0%
coming much sooner for a given level of
 
06:06:22.590 --> 06:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
carbon di carbon dioxide in the
 
06:06:25.910 --> 06:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
atmosphere then people had modeled and
 
06:06:27.590 --> 06:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
if that's true
 
06:06:30.190 --> 06:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
and it's a hot debate that among
 
06:06:34.070 --> 06:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
scientists then the actual effects of of
 
06:06:35.590 --> 06:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
of hot very high levels of carbon
 
06:06:38.670 --> 06:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
dioxide are going to be worse and sooner
 
06:06:41.070 --> 06:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
than we had expected so far which would
 
06:06:43.190 --> 06:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
mean of course the social cost of carbon
 
06:06:46.990 --> 06:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
maybe even even at $195 may be grossly
 
06:06:48.948 --> 06:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
underestimated but let let's just stick
 
06:06:50.468 --> 06:06:50.478 align:start position:0%
with that so hundreds in the general
 
06:06:53.390 --> 06:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
bpark but let's look at let's look at
 
06:06:55.150 --> 06:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
the assumptions on that and see if
 
06:06:56.990 --> 06:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's actually what the Federal
 
06:06:59.868 --> 06:06:59.878 align:start position:0%
government is currently paying to reduce
 
06:07:02.990 --> 06:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
a ton of carbon the buyer of a a Tesla
 
06:07:05.070 --> 06:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
for instance is probably not buying if
 
06:07:06.590 --> 06:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
he didn't buy a Tesla probably would not
 
06:07:09.390 --> 06:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
buy a 21 Mile g a gallon car there are a
 
06:07:11.670 --> 06:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
lot of nice hybrids made by you know
 
06:07:15.070 --> 06:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
Honda or Toyota that get almost 50 a
 
06:07:17.670 --> 06:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
gallon so let's say they get twice as
 
06:07:20.310 --> 06:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
much miles per gallon that means they
 
06:07:22.310 --> 06:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
emit more like 2 and a half tons of
 
06:07:25.110 --> 06:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
carbon per year that would mean
 
06:07:27.548 --> 06:07:27.558 align:start position:0%
therefore that the implied cost of
 
06:07:30.468 --> 06:07:30.478 align:start position:0%
carbon is more than double 100 let's say
 
06:07:32.948 --> 06:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
it's 200 okay which is
 
06:07:34.910 --> 06:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
conservative if you're following me here
 
06:07:37.270 --> 06:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
because we're only avoiding half of the
 
06:07:40.230 --> 06:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
carbon by buying the Tesla instead of
 
06:07:44.670 --> 06:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
the car so it's really $200 a ton of
 
06:07:46.270 --> 06:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
carbon that the federal government is is
 
06:07:48.390 --> 06:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
currently paying then let's also
 
06:07:51.150 --> 06:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
consider as people have pointed out uh
 
06:07:55.430 --> 06:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
that the person charging the r is not
 
06:07:57.548 --> 06:07:57.558 align:start position:0%
likely to be using 100% % renewable
 
06:07:59.190 --> 06:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
energy some people have the panels on
 
06:08:01.310 --> 06:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
their roof and they use the charge a car
 
06:08:02.190 --> 06:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
but a lot of people are going to be
 
06:08:05.350 --> 06:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
using some mixture of natural gas
 
06:08:08.390 --> 06:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh hydroelectric in certain parts of
 
06:08:10.390 --> 06:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
the country coal even not so much in New
 
06:08:13.548 --> 06:08:13.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um that's certainly going to
 
06:08:15.548 --> 06:08:15.558 align:start position:0%
mean that you're not saving the full two
 
06:08:17.270 --> 06:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
and a half tons of carbon a year by
 
06:08:20.510 --> 06:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
driving EV and then furthermore as uh I
 
06:08:23.830 --> 06:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
think representative O'Brien or F bat
 
06:08:26.788 --> 06:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
could point out producing an EV Tak
 
06:08:28.510 --> 06:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
makes more carbon than producing a
 
06:08:29.948 --> 06:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
conventional car particularly the
 
06:08:32.350 --> 06:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
batteries are very carbon intensive to
 
06:08:36.190 --> 06:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
produce so um and then finally and a big
 
06:08:38.910 --> 06:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
thing is some of the people that buy EVs
 
06:08:41.590 --> 06:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
do not buy them because of the tax
 
06:08:44.430 --> 06:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
credit they buy them because they go Z
 
06:08:47.030 --> 06:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
to 60 in 3 seconds or they really like
 
06:08:50.310 --> 06:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
them for other reasons and for those
 
06:08:52.948 --> 06:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
people the $7,500 credit to take an
 
06:08:55.788 --> 06:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
extreme example Leonardo DiCaprio
 
06:08:57.350 --> 06:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
probably would have bought a test
 
06:09:00.430 --> 06:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
regardless that $7500 is straight out
 
06:09:03.670 --> 06:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
the window in terms of reductions in
 
06:09:05.430 --> 06:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
carbon because you're giving money to
 
06:09:07.628 --> 06:09:07.638 align:start position:0%
someone who's going to already do that
 
06:09:10.270 --> 06:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
so a lot of people um have looked at
 
06:09:13.510 --> 06:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
this and they've said that the actual
 
06:09:16.390 --> 06:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
implied cost of carbon that the federal
 
06:09:20.110 --> 06:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
government's EV tax credit is based on
 
06:09:23.948 --> 06:09:23.958 align:start position:0%
comes out to more like $3 $400 a
 
06:09:27.670 --> 06:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
ton Which is higher than most estimates
 
06:09:30.788 --> 06:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
of of the social cost of carbon now on
 
06:09:31.830 --> 06:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
the one
 
06:09:34.750 --> 06:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
hand even if you care about climate
 
06:09:38.270 --> 06:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
change uh that seems
 
06:09:40.788 --> 06:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
excessive but on the other hand
 
06:09:42.190 --> 06:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
especially if you care about climate
 
06:09:45.310 --> 06:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
change it seems kind of crazy to be
 
06:09:48.430 --> 06:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
spending three or $400 of federal money
 
06:09:51.310 --> 06:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money to prevent one ton of
 
06:09:55.070 --> 06:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
carbon be admitted by a car that is
 
06:09:58.590 --> 06:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
instead where some instead buys an EV
 
06:10:03.070 --> 06:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
and yet charging zero cost of carbon for
 
06:10:04.910 --> 06:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
you or I or anyone else in this country
 
06:10:06.990 --> 06:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
walks into the the L nearest Chevy
 
06:10:09.750 --> 06:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
dealer and buy a 17 Mile a gallon
 
06:10:11.708 --> 06:10:11.718 align:start position:0%
Suburban that will be on the road for
 
06:10:15.948 --> 06:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
the next 15 years so this is I think a
 
06:10:18.868 --> 06:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
pretty concrete example of the
 
06:10:23.110 --> 06:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
inefficiency of subsidies relative to
 
06:10:24.910 --> 06:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
carbon fees because first of all the
 
06:10:26.868 --> 06:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
carbon fee is going to take into into
 
06:10:28.510 --> 06:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
account everything involved in the
 
06:10:31.468 --> 06:10:31.478 align:start position:0%
transportation system producing the
 
06:10:35.708 --> 06:10:35.718 align:start position:0%
car driving the car not just you know
 
06:10:37.948 --> 06:10:37.958 align:start position:0%
the and and the size of the car so what
 
06:10:40.750 --> 06:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
we have now is we have an EV Market
 
06:10:42.910 --> 06:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
where the manufacturers like it's it's
 
06:10:44.990 --> 06:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
tough to make money making these things
 
06:10:49.390 --> 06:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
so we have a profusion of 6,000 pound
 
06:10:53.868 --> 06:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
EVS that are uh at
 
06:10:57.310 --> 06:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
best maybe neutral with a small gas car
 
06:10:59.990 --> 06:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of Co carbon total carbon
 
06:11:02.270 --> 06:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
emissions right so that's not good
 
06:11:03.750 --> 06:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
policy it's not good policy from the
 
06:11:06.270 --> 06:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayer standpoint it's not good policy
 
06:11:09.510 --> 06:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
from the uh yes from from climate change
 
06:11:11.350 --> 06:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me that you're you're talking
 
06:11:13.430 --> 06:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
primarily about federal government
 
06:11:16.628 --> 06:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
decisions I am but it's all related well
 
06:11:19.110 --> 06:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
I hope you would you would draw it to be
 
06:11:21.350 --> 06:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
specific to this bill and right well I I
 
06:11:22.590 --> 06:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
was trying to address some of the
 
06:11:24.670 --> 06:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
situation questions for instance that
 
06:11:26.788 --> 06:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative Simon asked about the
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
right and as regards to representative
 
06:11:32.910 --> 06:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
Dolan's point that this bill sounds like
 
06:11:32.920 --> 06:11:34.150 align:start position:0%
Dolan's point that this bill sounds like
social

06:11:34.150 --> 06:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
social
 
06:11:36.830 --> 06:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
engineering um I I I would dispute that
 
06:11:38.708 --> 06:11:38.718 align:start position:0%
because as people have pointed out what
 
06:11:40.510 --> 06:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
we're really doing right now is running
 
06:11:43.830 --> 06:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
a massive geoengineering project we are
 
06:11:46.230 --> 06:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
we are injecting massive quantities of
 
06:11:48.830 --> 06:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
CO2 into the country into the atmosphere
 
06:11:51.510 --> 06:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
quantities that are so large that the
 
06:11:55.468 --> 06:11:55.478 align:start position:0%
scientists who first figured out that
 
06:11:58.150 --> 06:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
CO2 would create a greenhouse effect
 
06:12:00.070 --> 06:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
which was before the Civil
 
06:12:03.990 --> 06:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
War could not fathom the quantities that
 
06:12:06.510 --> 06:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
would be necessary to actually change
 
06:12:09.070 --> 06:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere to an appreciable degree
 
06:12:12.830 --> 06:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
and we've gotten there 150 years later
 
06:12:14.628 --> 06:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
and we're we're shooting past these
 
06:12:17.350 --> 06:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
targets uh at this you know in an
 
06:12:21.708 --> 06:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
unbelievable um rate um so so we have a
 
06:12:25.350 --> 06:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
market failure and to stop our
 
06:12:28.270 --> 06:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
geoengineering EXP experiment we have to
 
06:12:31.990 --> 06:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
apply the Classic Market tool of pricing
 
06:12:35.468 --> 06:12:35.478 align:start position:0%
carbon and the sooner New Hampshire does
 
06:12:39.310 --> 06:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
that with their own uh the argument for
 
06:12:41.270 --> 06:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
doing in New Hampshire there there are a
 
06:12:45.628 --> 06:12:45.638 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons one um the explicit
 
06:12:48.468 --> 06:12:48.478 align:start position:0%
costs uh that are there right now should
 
06:12:48.478 --> 06:12:49.190 align:start position:0%
costs uh that are there right now should
be

06:12:49.190 --> 06:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:12:52.468 --> 06:12:52.478 align:start position:0%
acknowledged to there is we are going to
 
06:12:53.868 --> 06:12:53.878 align:start position:0%
eventually have carbon pricing at the
 
06:12:55.390 --> 06:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
federal level simply because nothing
 
06:12:57.510 --> 06:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
else is going to be
 
06:13:00.990 --> 06:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
efficient and three it will serve an
 
06:13:04.390 --> 06:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
example to the rest of the country that
 
06:13:06.910 --> 06:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable people and a reasonable State
 
06:13:09.670 --> 06:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
can come up with something that is going
 
06:13:12.110 --> 06:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
to help everyone and the politics I may
 
06:13:13.990 --> 06:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
make a mention of the politics of
 
06:13:16.548 --> 06:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
climate change are not very promising
 
06:13:18.708 --> 06:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
right now given that the single most
 
06:13:21.830 --> 06:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
important policy is pricing carbon and
 
06:13:24.230 --> 06:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
even the most moderate candidate on the
 
06:13:27.708 --> 06:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
Republican side uh has said the market
 
06:13:30.468 --> 06:13:30.478 align:start position:0%
will solve this problem which does not
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
happen if you have a market failure
 
06:13:33.990 --> 06:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's the definition of market failure
 
06:13:36.708 --> 06:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
the market will not solve the problem
 
06:13:39.510 --> 06:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
and her solution is one of her proposals
 
06:13:42.030 --> 06:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
is actually to eliminate the federal gas
 
06:13:44.628 --> 06:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
tax which of course is the exact
 
06:13:46.548 --> 06:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
opposite direction we need to go in the
 
06:13:48.190 --> 06:13:48.200 align:start position:0%
federal gas tax already doesn't even
 
06:13:51.350 --> 06:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
cost cover the cost of Highways so so
 
06:13:53.628 --> 06:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
it's not a promising situation
 
06:13:56.390 --> 06:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
politically on one hand right right but
 
06:14:00.590 --> 06:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
will say that um one thing that is
 
06:14:03.708 --> 06:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
promising is if when you ask
 
06:14:06.910 --> 06:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
people um how much they care about
 
06:14:08.708 --> 06:14:08.718 align:start position:0%
climate change is it a big threat what
 
06:14:10.030 --> 06:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
we want to do about it you get some
 
06:14:12.510 --> 06:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
interesting things so if you look at
 
06:14:14.310 --> 06:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
Republicans even though only a quarter
 
06:14:16.948 --> 06:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
of them see it as a big threat and a
 
06:14:22.310 --> 06:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
half of them actually uh only a half say
 
06:14:24.910 --> 06:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
that it's basically a man-made
 
06:14:28.788 --> 06:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
problem two thirds or more say they
 
06:14:33.548 --> 06:14:33.558 align:start position:0%
favor federal tax credits for carbon
 
06:14:34.868 --> 06:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
capture and
 
06:14:38.070 --> 06:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
sequestration now if you don't think
 
06:14:40.910 --> 06:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
that climate change is man-made by
 
06:14:43.270 --> 06:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
burning fossil fuels or that it's a big
 
06:14:46.350 --> 06:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
problem favoring a federal tax credit
 
06:14:48.270 --> 06:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
for carbon quest uh capture and
 
06:14:50.990 --> 06:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
sequestration is like favoring a tax
 
06:14:53.150 --> 06:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
credit for digging holes and filling
 
06:14:54.788 --> 06:14:54.798 align:start position:0%
them back in I mean why would you
 
06:14:58.430 --> 06:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
possibly bother so I think that there's
 
06:15:02.350 --> 06:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of you know Kabuki going on here
 
06:15:06.868 --> 06:15:06.878 align:start position:0%
people have uh in our extreme partisan
 
06:15:08.868 --> 06:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
politics really negative partisanship
 
06:15:10.510 --> 06:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
where anything one side favors the other
 
06:15:12.548 --> 06:15:12.558 align:start position:0%
side automatically opposes and this
 
06:15:14.150 --> 06:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
happens on both sides by the way we've
 
06:15:16.590 --> 06:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
seen it in Immigration yes on the
 
06:15:20.548 --> 06:15:20.558 align:start position:0%
Democratic side that
 
06:15:24.110 --> 06:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
that people instinctively have to say
 
06:15:25.788 --> 06:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
they believe something isn't happening
 
06:15:27.788 --> 06:15:27.798 align:start position:0%
even if their own eyes tell them that
 
06:15:30.390 --> 06:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
that it is and you see this when older
 
06:15:32.548 --> 06:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
people are more likely to buy deny
 
06:15:34.150 --> 06:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
climate change even though obviously
 
06:15:36.430 --> 06:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
people who can remember the 70s or the
 
06:15:39.270 --> 06:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
60s are obviously more confident that
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
the climate has changed than someone who
 
06:15:43.110 --> 06:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
was born 20 years ago right because it's
 
06:15:46.590 --> 06:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
changed a lot more so um let me I I know
 
06:15:48.548 --> 06:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
I'm trying I'm a little disorganized
 
06:15:49.910 --> 06:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
because everyone else said most of the
 
06:15:54.150 --> 06:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
useful stuff um let me just see here uh
 
06:15:57.830 --> 06:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh the only other thing well I I'd
 
06:16:00.670 --> 06:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned regarding uh representative
 
06:16:02.750 --> 06:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
Dolan's Point how is anyone going to
 
06:16:03.868 --> 06:16:03.878 align:start position:0%
afford anything how are we're going to
 
06:16:07.150 --> 06:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
address the least fortunate Among Us um
 
06:16:09.830 --> 06:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
the the the most sensible proposal for
 
06:16:13.030 --> 06:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
pricing carbon is uh carbon fee and
 
06:16:17.830 --> 06:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
dividend where instead of the carbon fee
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
being a tax that is just held by the
 
06:16:21.430 --> 06:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
federal government to spend wherever
 
06:16:24.750 --> 06:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
they want 100% of the revenues from this
 
06:16:26.548 --> 06:16:26.558 align:start position:0%
fee which would be sign significant
 
06:16:28.270 --> 06:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
because the fee would go up every year
 
06:16:29.670 --> 06:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
until the problem is
 
06:16:32.788 --> 06:16:32.798 align:start position:0%
solved um are are rebated back to
 
06:16:34.788 --> 06:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
American households on a per capita
 
06:16:37.590 --> 06:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
basis adult gets a full share kids get a
 
06:16:41.830 --> 06:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
half share and if you think every adult
 
06:16:43.910 --> 06:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
would get back the same amount
 
06:16:46.590 --> 06:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of how much they're paying in
 
06:16:48.190 --> 06:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
through the carbon fee and if you think
 
06:16:52.910 --> 06:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
about it uh the yeah the the least
 
06:16:54.708 --> 06:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
affluent people say a guy living in a
 
06:16:56.310 --> 06:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
small apartment in Manchester and taking
 
06:16:59.390 --> 06:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
city buses his cost of living will go up
 
06:17:01.868 --> 06:17:01.878 align:start position:0%
almost not at all because he's using
 
06:17:04.990 --> 06:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
very little fossil fuels okay anyone
 
06:17:06.788 --> 06:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
who's has large
 
06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
Mansions uh speedboats or to take an
 
06:17:11.670 --> 06:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
extreme example a private jet is going
 
06:17:13.628 --> 06:17:13.638 align:start position:0%
to be paying a lot into this of these
 
06:17:15.590 --> 06:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
fees but he only going to be getting
 
06:17:18.230 --> 06:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
back the same rebate that the guy living
 
06:17:19.788 --> 06:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
in the in the one B apartment in
 
06:17:22.310 --> 06:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester gets so the people at the
 
06:17:25.750 --> 06:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
bottom of the of our economic hierarchy
 
06:17:28.190 --> 06:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
are are going to be coming out ahead
 
06:17:29.910 --> 06:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
people who are extremely affluent who
 
06:17:31.390 --> 06:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
let's be honest are actually the biggest
 
06:17:32.948 --> 06:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
sources of the problem are going to be
 
06:17:35.310 --> 06:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
paying in a lot more than they get back
 
06:17:38.110 --> 06:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
so um that's that uh very difficult to
 
06:17:40.150 --> 06:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
talk about an issue that that has
 
06:17:42.788 --> 06:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot of implications but um
 
06:17:44.150 --> 06:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know as Barb said I think it's
 
06:17:48.030 --> 06:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
important to government has to accept
 
06:17:50.750 --> 06:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
reality and kind of has to look ahead to
 
06:17:52.390 --> 06:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
the Future and the future our future in
 
06:17:54.948 --> 06:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
many respects is determined we're going
 
06:17:57.150 --> 06:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
to have climate change and its effects
 
06:17:59.990 --> 06:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
for at least decades to come the goal is
 
06:18:01.910 --> 06:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
to try to minimize those and it's the
 
06:18:04.430 --> 06:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
role of government to to accept those
 
06:18:06.868 --> 06:18:06.878 align:start position:0%
facts and and the future that's coming
 
06:18:09.390 --> 06:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
rather than just wish it away so but I
 
06:18:11.468 --> 06:18:11.478 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time thank you thank you
 
06:18:12.750 --> 06:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
for your
 
06:18:18.628 --> 06:18:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:20.910 --> 06:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
yep sounds like you've thought about
 
06:18:24.230 --> 06:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
this for more than a few hours um so are
 
06:18:25.910 --> 06:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
you willing to come to the sub commit
 
06:18:28.910 --> 06:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee and help us with some
 
06:18:33.910 --> 06:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
Progressive I use the word cautiously um
 
06:18:36.990 --> 06:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
some Progressive steps here in New
 
06:18:40.190 --> 06:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on this bill uh sure sure I'm
 
06:18:41.990 --> 06:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
sure there who are you and where are you
 
06:18:44.590 --> 06:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
from uh I live in exor I'm just a
 
06:18:46.510 --> 06:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
private citizen but yeah I have thought
 
06:18:48.670 --> 06:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
about climate change I mean
 
06:18:50.948 --> 06:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
basically um sounds like you've got an
 
06:18:54.430 --> 06:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
educated background in The Sciences uh
 
06:18:58.590 --> 06:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
no no I studied e college but that's
 
06:19:00.510 --> 06:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
congratulations on having an excellent
 
06:19:04.670 --> 06:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
teacher okay representative Gard thank
 
06:19:06.350 --> 06:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
you madam chair just I want to address a
 
06:19:07.788 --> 06:19:07.798 align:start position:0%
couple things you said just because I
 
06:19:08.948 --> 06:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
think it's important but I think we're
 
06:19:10.910 --> 06:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
looking at this we see it from a
 
06:19:12.070 --> 06:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
different point of view and I just want
 
06:19:14.190 --> 06:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
to kind of clarify this establish it so
 
06:19:16.190 --> 06:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
losing to Winners and so forth totally
 
06:19:18.070 --> 06:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
agree but are you aware that the US
 
06:19:19.270 --> 06:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
government this is from an MIT
 
06:19:21.590 --> 06:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
technology review article of 2019 the US
 
06:19:22.990 --> 06:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
government has approved funds for
 
06:19:24.708 --> 06:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
geoengineering research you mentioned
 
06:19:26.948 --> 06:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
geoengineering from the car aspect but
 
06:19:28.310 --> 06:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
the US government for the first time
 
06:19:30.270 --> 06:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
authorized this is 2019 funding for GE
 
06:19:31.708 --> 06:19:31.718 align:start position:0%
engineering controversial idea that we
 
06:19:33.150 --> 06:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
could counteract climate change by
 
06:19:34.868 --> 06:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
reflecting heat away from the planet so
 
06:19:36.830 --> 06:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
they're injecting all these chemicals
 
06:19:38.310 --> 06:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
above us to create these artificial
 
06:19:40.230 --> 06:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
clouds to reflect sunlight I just want
 
06:19:42.430 --> 06:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
to bring that up that we're trying to
 
06:19:44.468 --> 06:19:44.478 align:start position:0%
address this issue I I'm just he
 
06:19:47.150 --> 06:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned it so I think it's game I
 
06:19:48.708 --> 06:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
gentlemen I'm sure it would be a
 
06:19:51.110 --> 06:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
fascinating discussion but I don't think
 
06:19:51.120 --> 06:19:52.310 align:start position:0%
fascinating discussion but I don't think
you

06:19:52.310 --> 06:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:19:54.708 --> 06:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
need there there's some research on that
 
06:19:57.150 --> 06:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
the United States is not currently
 
06:20:00.030 --> 06:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
trying to uh modify the climate by
 
06:20:03.750 --> 06:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
injecting things in the atmosphere yeah
 
06:20:05.910 --> 06:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much I'm going
 
06:20:09.430 --> 06:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
to close the hearing on House Bill
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
whatever it
 
06:20:10.878 --> 06:20:14.830 align:start position:0%
whatever it
is

06:20:14.830 --> 06:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:17.910 --> 06:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
1486 may I just make a comment not a
 
06:20:20.430 --> 06:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
question just a short little comment
 
06:20:23.350 --> 06:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
oh just for everybody's enjoyment the
 
06:20:26.868 --> 06:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
sap is running in Bradford as we speak
 
06:20:30.190 --> 06:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
the who sap to make syrup which usually
 
06:20:32.670 --> 06:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
happens in March and April all right
 
06:20:33.980 --> 06:20:33.990 align:start position:0%
