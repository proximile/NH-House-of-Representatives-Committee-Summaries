00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
we're on hold so we can get all of the t

of these work sessions is to go through
 
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
proposed maps by committee members and
 
00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 align:start position:0%
have maps to go to
 
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
public input sessions next week
 
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 align:start position:0%

p.m
 
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
today we're going to review
 
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
the county commissioner submissions for
 
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
hb 54
 
00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
and four state rep maps for hb 50 that
 
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
would be merrimack
 
00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 align:start position:0%
belknap rockingham and coast
 
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we will be addressing the
 
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
remaining six
 
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
counties for state reps
 
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
and the congressional district
 
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
now that's a lot of maps i'm going to
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
ask committee members to work primarily
 
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
off the paper copies that you have been
 
00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 align:start position:0%
provided so we know we're all looking at
 
00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
if you have your computer on that's fine
 
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
but for purposes of map discussion let's
 
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
stay with what you've got
 
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
let's go through the crib sheets that i
 
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
have prepared
 
00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 align:start position:0%
or lindsay
 
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
in staff has prepared at great help
 
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
you should all have a sheet that looks
 
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.510 align:start position:0%
like this
this

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
corresponds to the stack of maps that
 
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
are underneath it and the number on the
 
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
left of that sheet you will find
 
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the first page of the
 
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
set of maps
 
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.229 align:start position:0%
set of maps
so

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 align:start position:0%
initial as you can see we don't go quite
 
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
consecutively because we sort of went
 
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
through this and had to pull some
 
00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
because they either were not accurate or
 
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
not applicable to today's maps but the
 
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
numbering is correct for you to follow
 
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
so for example number one
 
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
is a coast county commissioner map
 
00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 align:start position:0%
and for each map you should have a
 
00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.790 align:start position:0%
and for each map you should have a
printout

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
printout
 
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
and then the program
 
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
calculation for numbers
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
you should also have a sheet that looks
 
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
and this is an attempt
 
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
to give you
 
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
an order
 
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
which corresponds with the map numbers
 
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
so we're going to discuss commissioners
 
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.229 align:start position:0%
so we're going to discuss commissioners
first

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
and we're going to start with bellnap
 
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
and so that means we're going to be
 
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
going to map number four in your pile
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
and then because of the way the
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner files were sent over you're
 
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
going to pull number 7
 
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
because there are 10 commissioner maps
 
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
in there and we will go through those
 
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
as compared to the belknap coast and
 
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
merrimack so i have
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
two commissioner maps of middles
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
for belknap
 
00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
coast and merrimack
 
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
i have only received
 
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
one commissioner submission for the
 
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.670 align:start position:0%
one commissioner submission for the
remaining

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
remaining
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
seven counties
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
so one of the purposes of this is to go
 
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
through so if somebody wants to do
 
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
another map or we think something needs
 
00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
to happen we have the chance to do it
 
00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.469 align:start position:0%
to happen we have the chance to do it
okay

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
let's start
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative lane
 
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um i think you mentioned
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
before about availability on the website
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
we all learned that
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
the website's not
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
working is it going to be corrected
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
before next week because members of the
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
public can't access and don't have
 
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
copies of these maps so
 
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.110 align:start position:0%
copies of these maps so
what

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
the website was apparently updated
 
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
i suspect over the weekend because
 
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
monday i got an email that said there's
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
a new website by the time i took a look
 
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
at it at monday night i went to the
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
redistricting website which now sort of
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
corresponds with the website format that
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
the senate has been using in general for
 
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
a little while and when i went to click
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
on view submitted testimony there was
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
nothing there so it was conduct
 
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.310 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
they have corrected the categories in
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
the list of submissions we are in the
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
process now of informing them because i
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
just learned this morning that
 
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.189 align:start position:0%
just learned this morning that
apparently

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
while there's a list of the submitted
 
00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
testimony you can't actually open
 
00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.270 align:start position:0%
testimony you can't actually open
anything

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
so when we get through the work sessions
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
it is my hope that those issues will be
 
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.189 align:start position:0%
it is my hope that those issues will be
resolved

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
and once uploading is resolved there
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
will be the maps that come out of this
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
work session will be placed online
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah and do me a follow-up
 
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative lane um
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
are the things that we're looking at are
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
they over on the table is the public
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
able to see them now or yes they were
 
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
there were copies put over there um i'm
 
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
not sure how we're going to handle that
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
in the future because um
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's a significant amount of paperwork
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
so we're going to see what we figure out
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
for going forward on that but that's
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
what we've tried to do for today okay
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
thank you and just like a regular uh
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
work session of the house
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes we guess and make enough
 
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.830 align:start position:0%
sometimes we guess and make enough
sometimes

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
we don't guess correctly so
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else before we get
 
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.590 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else before we get
started

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
why don't we start
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
with bellnap only because i am afraid
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
that if i go out of the order on this
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
sheet i will become hopelessly
 
00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:47.110 align:start position:0%
sheet i will become hopelessly
lost

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
lost
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
so the first commissioner map you should
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
find to review
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
is number four
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
for belknap commissioners and
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
you should have a map with
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
the calculation from the program for
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
deviation on the back
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
one number
 
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
four i understand representative porter
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
you press the either the blue or you
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
push red to lock
 
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
a little concerned as a substitute and
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
new to this
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
i've served on committee with you before
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not too worried okay thank you so
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
looking at belmont belknap county it was
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
not possible to create a map that kept
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
laconia together
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
so this proposed map keeps as much of
 
00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:51.510 align:start position:0%
so this proposed map keeps as much of
laconia

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
laconia
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
together as possible
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
and it puts one district
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
one ward 5 of
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
into a separate
 
00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:01.510 align:start position:0%
into a separate
district

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
so in this proposed map district 1
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
is now laconia wards 1
 
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.830 align:start position:0%
is now laconia wards 1
3

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
3
 
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.629 align:start position:0%
3
4

00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
4
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
5 and 6
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
meredith and center harbor
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
district 2 would be new hampton
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
san berton tilton belmont and gilmanton
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
district 3 would be laconia ward 2
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
guilford alton and barnstead
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
the deviation between the districts is
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
minus 2.9 percent to 2.5 percent
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
or a total of 5.4 percent
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
and the map also keeps the existing
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
three county commissioners in separate
 
00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.230 align:start position:0%
three county commissioners in separate
districts

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
so that's what this map
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
attempts to do
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative porter so
 
00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
um the easiest way to to look at these
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
quite frankly might be to look at the
 
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.430 align:start position:0%
quite frankly might be to look at the
numerical

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
numerical
 
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.750 align:start position:0%
numerical
listing

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
listing
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
on the back of the map
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
because as
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
just went through it's an easy way to
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
identify the communities that are in a
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
proposed district
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
and then when you look at the map side
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
you can see those districts in color
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
so we have another county
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner map for bellnap that is the
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
first page of number
 
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.389 align:start position:0%
first page of number
seven

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:41.670 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.030 align:start position:0%
i understand
that

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire would speak to
 
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.870 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire would speak to
this

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
again this was attempting to
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
balance out the
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
the the county
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
and as representative porter mentioned
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to keep laconia together
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
the wrong size for the county i'm afraid
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
so this keeps together
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
sanborn and tilton
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
and all of laconia except for ward one
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
it keeps together
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
belmont gilmanton barnstead and alton
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
which are
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
adjacent and interconnected
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
guilford meredith center harbor new
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
hampton and laconia ward 1.
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
the deviation is minus 3 to plus 3.9
 
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:48.710 align:start position:0%
the deviation is minus 3 to plus 3.9
and

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
that's

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.790 align:start position:0%
that's
okay

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
committee members comments
 
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
i'm embarrassed
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair because i really thought i
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
understood all of this
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
when it says in the bottom caption
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
i understand the 2020 populations
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
but how can
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
each of these be 2012 districts
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
when they're different
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
i think that refers to the underlying
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
program representative mcguire uh i
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
don't that shows up on every single
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
map it does so i believe it's the
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
essentially county and town lines i
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
don't know where that came from
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
but the populations are the 2020.
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
i understand the populations but i
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
i for example am curious about
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
what the existing
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
structure is i know that when we went
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
through it when a group of people
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
working with me went through it
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
we decided to keep
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
an overwhelming majority of the lines
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
the same county to county
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we didn't submit changes
 
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.629 align:start position:0%
that's why we didn't submit changes
but

00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
we need to have us
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful i think to see what
 
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.470 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful i think to see what
is

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
if that's relevant
 
00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:39.750 align:start position:0%
if that's relevant
or

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this label
 
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.150 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this label
um

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
the label is misleading i'm sorry for
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
belaboring but
 
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.350 align:start position:0%
belaboring but
i

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.629 align:start position:0%
i
i

00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
my mind isn't up to this creativity
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's not really a matter of creativity i
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
incorrect

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
number down there and it was supposed to
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
be 2012. yeah i'm not i'm not really too
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
worried about it because i know that the
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
the towns correspond with the deviation
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
calculation representative barry
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
yes to that point i mean
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
what matters is are the populations
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
accurate to the 2020 census numbers and
 
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
are the town lines correct and they
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
appear to be
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
so it's something i think we just
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
disregard and move on i apologize for
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
not addressing it earlier i did notice
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
it on the maps that were printed out but
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
there was no way that i was going to be
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
able to change the program printout and
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
there was no way that i was asking staff
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
to go through to whiteout 2012.
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you very
 
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
much i understand completely okay yes
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
representative porter i recognized
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i was just
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
wondering about in this map
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
are the county commissioners that exist
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
now are they still in the same districts
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know i've got a few people with
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
computers i'm sure they could look it up
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire yes i was i was
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
going to say that the current
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner districts are new hampton
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
belmont gilmanton and tilton
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
alton center harbor guilford and
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
meredith which is
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
not identical to either so
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
neither map corresponds to current
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
county commissioners i will say i've had
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
do a couple of mapping seminars and one
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the things they tell us is that
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
protecting incumbency
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
is not something that is to be done in
 
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:43.990 align:start position:0%
mapping so
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.189 align:start position:0%
mapping so
[Music]

00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
i think it is useful to see where
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
current lines are but i will say at
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
least from what i've been told that is
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
one of the tenets of mapping in
 
00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:55.430 align:start position:0%
one of the tenets of mapping in
redistricting

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
representative porter yes miss madam
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
chair is bellnap one of the counties
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
where all of the residents of the county
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
vote for all of the commissioners
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
i don't believe i don't believe so i
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
think that happens in stratford and i'm
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
not sure where else
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
no there's another one it has no there's
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
another one that does the dis that still
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
districts them but you you everybody
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
votes i'm not sure which one it is it's
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
not hillsboro i know that no
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%

thank you does anybody know i should
know

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.069 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
all right representative mcguire could
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
you go through the current districts
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
after having said we're not supposed to
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
pay any attention to it
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
um could you go through what the current
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
districts are again a little slower
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
new hampton
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%

gilmanton
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%

guilford meredith
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
so it's it's so it's a little all over
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you um and
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i don't know what um
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
your policy would be toward using
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
computers i think several of us have
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
have them
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
and for those that do i might just
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
mention that chapter 662 of the rsas
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
lists out all the towns in the various
 
00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:45.430 align:start position:0%
lists out all the towns in the various
districts

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
for for all the
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
county commissioners and wards and so on
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
so it might be handy for those with
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
computers to just have that i believe if
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
you have a copy of the bill and of
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
course i don't have that um
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
notebook with me today the bills
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
actually list them
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
as they exist currently because those
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
bills were taken
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh modified for the year but the actual
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
listings for example in the reps and all
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
of those are as they are currently in
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
executive session we'll be taking those
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
bills and voting on them with our
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
amendment so representative bergeon is
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
correct you can look in statute or the
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill representative barry
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
um yes madam chairman i just want to go
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
back to your original point which is
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
when we draw these lines
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned factoring in where the
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
incumbents live and what the current
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
lines are is not it's not something
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
that we've taken up as a standard in any
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
way and i don't believe from what you
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
just said it should be a standard in any
 
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.750 align:start position:0%
just said it should be a standard in any
way

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm kind of curious why we're going
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
through reading the current lines and
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
asking where the current incumbents live
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
when that's not something that we've
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
established as a standard to move
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
forward with in fact i i would recommend
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
against doing that
 
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.909 align:start position:0%
against doing that
i

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
might tend to agree with you but i
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
believe somebody was saying that that's
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
something they did representative porter
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes i was just curious because the map
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
that i presented made that point and i
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure if it was something that
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
was considered that's all so it's my
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
ignorance and i apologize i don't think
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's ignorance it's a question everybody
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
has it's just from a mapping standpoint
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
we need i think we need to be careful
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
that that's not
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things we rely on
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron um madam chai i
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
would just also mention and i think this
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
is somewhat permissible in the
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
redistricting process to give
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
consideration to the kinds of disruption
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
you might cause to existing voters in
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
existing districts or awards or
 
00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:37.430 align:start position:0%
existing districts or awards or
precincts

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
precincts
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
if in for example
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
a redistricting would change 50 percent
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
of the people who are registered to
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
already registered to vote in one
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
precinct award
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
a significant impact that might be a
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
factor in the hierarchy of deciding uh
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
what type of redistricting to do thank
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
you for that comment that presumes the
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
base you're starting from was one that
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
was constitutionally accurate i would
 
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.270 align:start position:0%
was constitutionally accurate i would
think

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
and that it would remain
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
constitutionally accurate and i think we
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
know from looking at some of our maps
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
that might not be the case
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
all right it's always fun to be the
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
can i go home now
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
i want to thank representative porter
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
for being a good sport on that
 
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.789 align:start position:0%
for being a good sport on that
um

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
and while we're talking just so i'm
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
going through my my multiple maps so
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
that i can sort of label them a little
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
further so when we get to them anything
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
else on belknap county
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
all right belknap county commissioners
 
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.150 align:start position:0%
all right belknap county commissioners
so

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
we've heard from representative porter
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
as to map four
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
and representative mcguire as to map
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
seven i'm actually calling it 7a
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have a bunch of
 
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.830 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have a bunch of
them

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.190 align:start position:0%
them
they

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
they both seem to have deviations
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
which are
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
am i seeing any other hands or comments
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
on belknap county
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
you sure representative maguire
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we at least look at carol and
 
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.310 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we at least look at carol and
cheshire

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just going through the list
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
that i have
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through all of them
 
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.310 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through all of them
i

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
just so and i understand we can do it
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
alphabetically or not unfortunately for
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
all of you what i'm doing
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
is working off of that
 
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.110 align:start position:0%
is working off of that
map

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
map
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
sheet where i thought it would be useful
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
to go through the maps that we have two
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
maps for
 
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.470 align:start position:0%
maps for
first

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.870 align:start position:0%
first
so

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
coast representative turcotte why don't
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
you start off talking about your map for
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
coast county commissioners certainly
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.310 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning
everybody

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
presumably presuming everybody has a map
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
in front of them so you're going to see
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much the northern part of the
 
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.830 align:start position:0%
pretty much the northern part of the
county

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's shown in green there is one
 
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.029 align:start position:0%
that's shown in green there is one
district

00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
we have berlin kilkenny and jefferson as
 
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.950 align:start position:0%
we have berlin kilkenny and jefferson as
another

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
and then the remainder of the county to
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
the south and southwest is
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
the third
 
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.750 align:start position:0%
the third
district

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
on the back of that they they list all
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
the towns i'm not going to read them all
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
because a lot of these towns have zero
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
individuals in them
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
but when you get to the very end you
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
will see that the overall
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
deviation is minus 1.1 to plus 0.6 for
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
an overall 1.7 overall
 
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.590 align:start position:0%
an overall 1.7 overall
deviation

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
so yes indeed it becomes a little
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
problematic when communities have a
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
population for the census of zero
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
they need to go somewhere even with the
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
zero though i suppose that's arguably an
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
could we completely eliminate the
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'm and i'm going to defer to
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative lin for that hypothetical
 
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:16.870 align:start position:0%
representative lin for that hypothetical
question

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative barry so this is a little
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
slightly off topic but if the community
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
indulge me i've always wanted to say
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
this in a hearing there are occasions in
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
coast county where an individual will
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
vote from
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
a township and they will be the only
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
person voting from that township and
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
their results are reported from that
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
township so their access to a secret
 
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.510 align:start position:0%
township so their access to a secret
ballot

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
is not around he goes and i've always
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
thought it's been super awkward if they
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
had a neighbor and they said hey you
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
know tim did you vote for me he's like
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
oh of course i did and then joe goes to
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
check the results and turns out
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:59.909 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
all right any any questions for
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte on
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
pretty close piedra i i actually want
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
him at the beginning of this meeting to
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
apologize and i'll have to go to him at
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the next meeting to
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
apologize again you're working on it
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's what counts
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:30.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
again this is one of the counties where
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
the population chefs have necessitated a
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
change from the current maps um so we we
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
have submitted a change here
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
the proposed map
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
which is map number one i guess
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
creates two kind of uh geographically
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
compact districts um one with berlin and
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
one with milan and one
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
with lancaster
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
jefferson northumberland and whitefield
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
among others
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
and then a larger district
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
mostly with with
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
the total deviation is 6.2 percent in
 
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.470 align:start position:0%
the total deviation is 6.2 percent in
this

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.029 align:start position:0%
this
map

00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
map
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
i will say and i i
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
there's already been some discussion
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
about this and um
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
keeping existing commissioners in
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
separate districts our map does not as a
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
not the intent of the map i guess it's a
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
side effect of the way it was mapped
 
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.909 align:start position:0%
side effect of the way it was mapped
um

00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
i will
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
i guess not challenge but i i guess i
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
have a question about
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
why that isn't
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
something that is a good thing
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
i could just be my lay perspective but
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
it seems like allowing voters to
 
00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:50.950 align:start position:0%
it seems like allowing voters to
continue

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
choosing the representatives that they
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
rather than forcing them to choose
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
someone else
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
is a potential positive um
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
so i'll just throw that out there and
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
there's something i'm missing that's
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
fine again not a
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
goal of this map but um it is a result
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
of this map that i think is not the case
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
in the map that was
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
i know representative smith has attended
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
a couple of those
 
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.830 align:start position:0%
a couple of those
[Music]

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
um mapping redistricting seminars does
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question but i
 
00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:37.510 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question but i
suppose

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
we would have to then agree that
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
everything that's currently is terrific
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
is constitutional
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
um and there is an idea that you're not
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
supposed to be protecting your own
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
incumbency it's one of the arguments in
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
regards to redistricting that occurs
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
as to how it is to proceed so while we
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
may not have any commissioners sitting
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
here we certainly have people sitting
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
here that are affected by redistricting
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
and to start with that premise requires
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
us all to start with the premise that
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
the existing map is serving
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
appropriately the interests of the
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
electorate and
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that's the case or
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
else we wouldn't have people saying
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh things in regards to where we should
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
go and redistricting so i sort of like
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
the approach that we're starting fresh
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
we have a population and we have
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
criteria that we have that we need to
 
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.470 align:start position:0%
criteria that we have that we need to
address

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
and we can look at all our constituents
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
and say whether or not you believe
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
you're represented is your choice
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
um we're we're meeting the bounds that
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
we have set
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
um it's an interesting concept anybody
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
else want to chime in representative
 
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.950 align:start position:0%
else want to chime in representative
barry

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
barry
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes madam chairman um
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
lines are for the people and not for the
 
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:57.190 align:start position:0%
lines are for the people and not for the
politicians

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative lynn yeah i just would
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
say i think from as like sort of as a
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional matter i think you are
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
right representative peter in the sense
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
that it's not it wouldn't be
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional to do that
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh but and i think there are
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know there's case law that certainly
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
says that but i think the for for the
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
reasons that some of the other
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
representatives have already said
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
on the question of is it a good idea
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
that you know it is obviously
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
an overt political consideration to say
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
well we're going to try to protect
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
incumbents and while you may
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
constitutionally be able to do that if
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
the objective is to you know
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
to sort of avoid the
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh to the extent possible the political
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
implications then then i think that uh
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
what what has been suggested are very
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron um
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
this is kind of related and i said kind
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
of related
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
the cities are
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
going to now seriously begin changing
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
their ward lines because city elections
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
are over and
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
there were some charter questions and so
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
on on the ballot this this past election
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
once the city's changed the award lines
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
that will have an impact on some of the
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
currently serving
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
state representatives
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
they may now be residing in a ward that
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's now in a different district so
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
would it be something we should be
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
considering when we look at our
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
legislation to ensure that those people
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
continue to serve out their terms even
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
if they have been bumped out of their
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
their awards or should we
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking filing periods too and
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm starting to get ahead of
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
myself but i i think you're getting a
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just to clarify
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
something representative lin said
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:57.830 align:start position:0%
in regards to
reps

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
reps
 
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.149 align:start position:0%
reps
piedra

00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
piedra
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
point and that is
 
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.350 align:start position:0%
point and that is
while

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
your issue might be allowed
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
constitutionally it's certainly not a
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandate
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's just just for clarification
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
representative piedra i just want to
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
clarify i said this already but
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
an objective in creating these maps
 
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.830 align:start position:0%
an objective in creating these maps
so

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
but i think it again in my lay opinion
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
if we have two maps and they're both
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
constitutionally permissible and i
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
haven't heard any reason why
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
one map is better than the other for
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
some other reason
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
then it seems to me that it's something
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
that can at least be discussed as a
 
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.430 align:start position:0%
that can at least be discussed as a
factor

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
factor
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
we may differ whether
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
an opinion i guess from a policy
 
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.389 align:start position:0%
an opinion i guess from a policy
perspective

00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's better to just be blind in
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
drawing maps or whether
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's better to allow
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
like i said a voter to continue voting
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
for a representative that they like
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
rather than being forced to make another
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
choice i think there's
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable policy disagreement there's
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
no right or wrong
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
in that but i just wanted to clarify not
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
the objective of this map
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and i will just
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
note that as he was speaking i was
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
thinking of the glories of youth
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
because there was a couple of
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
presumptions in that that current
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
representatives were of any type we're
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
going to be able to keep running and
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
running and running
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
and these maps are in fact one of the
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
goals of these maps i hope for everybody
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
is to draw fair maps for representation
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
for the people over the next 10 years so
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
i'm feeling very optimistic after that
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
statement representative barry
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes to representative bergeron's point
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's my understanding that
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
when we have an election in a district
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
you you cover that region until the next
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
election is certified or enacted right
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
when you know we get elected on november
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
and we all get sworn into december right
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
so you represent even if the district
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
even if the underlying district is
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
changing you represent those individual
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
those people until
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
the next election is
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
certified or enacted whatever we want to
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
call it
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
went to look to representative smith a
 
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.870 align:start position:0%
went to look to representative smith a
few

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
few
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
a few
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
exchanges ago i naturally looked to your
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
right thinking you were
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
thinking of the vice chair of this
 
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
thinking of the vice chair of this
committee

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
who i see is not present today so i'm
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
the only smith present and from now on i
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
um at least just for the day
 
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.110 align:start position:0%
um at least just for the day
um

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
but he will be here shortly so confusion
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
can resume oh dear me
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
well that's all right um i i do want to
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
say that um
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
i agree with with your point madam chair
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
this situation that we're trying to go
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
through in a very compact period of time
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
is complicated enough and
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
i would hope that we focus our
 
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.630 align:start position:0%
i would hope that we focus our
discussion

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
only on
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
the very core issues in terms of what is
 
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.830 align:start position:0%
the very core issues in terms of what is
constitutional

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
what is required
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
by federal and state law
 
00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.470 align:start position:0%
by federal and state law
and

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.990 align:start position:0%
and
not

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
include in our discussion issues which
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
might be interesting if we were
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day and sharing a cup
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
of tea
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
but are not
 
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely relevant
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
and essential to our decisions here
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
i think the the fewer of those um
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
outlying issues that
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
get raised the easier it will be
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
one hopes to find a way that all members
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
of this committee will be able to agree
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
on the best districts
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm so far i'm living
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
longer and we have an easy path so if
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
you keep this up we're doing good
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:27.669 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
uh

00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
i will just say i i do enjoy hearing uh
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
because criteria was not necessarily
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
agreed upon by the entire committee i do
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
really appreciate hearing
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
members took into consideration as they
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
were drawing the map so i do hope that
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
that continues not necessarily the
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
the information that would be shared
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
over a cup of tea i agree um but i think
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
the criteria is important and i think uh
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
members of the public have have asked
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
for specific criteria to be used so that
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
i i i hope that we don't lose that as
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
part of this conversation
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
all right believe it or not on my
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
meeting schedule we're still on coast
 
00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.230 align:start position:0%

commissioners
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
any comments further comments on the
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
coast commissioner maps that we've been
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
all right i'm not seeing any so we're
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
going to move on to merrimack county
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
two maps to consider for merrimack
 
00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:28.790 align:start position:0%
two maps to consider for merrimack
county

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
number two
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
from representative lane and in the
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
package labeled number seven it's
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
down there it would be
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
if you're doing alphabetizing g
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
so representative lane if you'd be kind
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
enough to start with your proposed map
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.510 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
merrimack county needed really small
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
changes to meet the population deviation
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
requirements the only change in our pro
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
proposed map
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
makes it um is moving willmont from
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
existing district three to district two
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
and with that change the deviation
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
between the districts is negative two
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
point seven percent to two point nine
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
percent for a total of five point six
 
00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:20.790 align:start position:0%
percent for a total of five point six
percent

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.550 align:start position:0%
percent
so

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
they gave me the easy one
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
any questions comments on

00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
okay i'm not seeing any
 
00:36:58.079 --> 00:36:59.270 align:start position:0%
okay i'm not seeing any

00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
mcguire
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
my plan on this was to keep the cities
 
00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.910 align:start position:0%
my plan on this was to keep the cities
together

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.710 align:start position:0%
together
and

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
which as is the current practice in
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner districts
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh concord has almost 13 reps
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
so i matched it with bow which
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
which is less than 500 off a perfect
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh one third of the county
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
rather than basquin and what and webster
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
which is further off
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
and then i
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
start started there trying to equalize
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
and you'll notice that the deviation is
 
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.910 align:start position:0%
and you'll notice that the deviation is
0.9

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
0.9
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
for both of district 2 and district 3.
 
00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.870 align:start position:0%
for both of district 2 and district 3.
so

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
the total deviation is 2.7 percent
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:11.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:11.119 --> 00:38:12.710 align:start position:0%
okay
questions

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
for representative mcguire comments
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
on the merrimack commissioner map in the
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
stack number seven representative porter
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um representative
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
are there um communities of interest
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
i say i don't know this information but
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
there might not be so many communities
 
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
of interest between pittsfield and
 
00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.150 align:start position:0%
of interest between pittsfield and
henniker

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
henniker
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
but yet that would all be one district
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
that's correct there's also no community
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
of interest between pittsfield and say
 
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.470 align:start position:0%
of interest between pittsfield and say

communities of interest representative
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
porter is not a standard that has been
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
adopted by the committee nor even really
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
discussed in death when you're talking a
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
third of the county representative
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
porter you've got
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
you it's it's
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
you you're going to have
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
hanaker and pittsfield are different no
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
question about it but so are newberry
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
and chichester
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
you've got to split the
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
once you say
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
concord sitting in the middle with
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
almost a third of the population you
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
then just divide it into contiguous
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
equal population groups
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.550 align:start position:0%
they're not
um

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's just population numbers you go
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.310 align:start position:0%
 
merrimack

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
the last county commissioner that i have
 
00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.390 align:start position:0%
the last county commissioner that i have
received

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
two maps for
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
now to packet seven
 
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.349 align:start position:0%
now to packet seven
and

00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
work our way through the maps that we
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
have not already discussed
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
and the first one would be carol
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to recognize
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
hello again everybody uh carroll county
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
again if you have it in front of you uh
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much the northern part of the
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
part that seems to come down a little
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
bit from that is the addition of
 
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.190 align:start position:0%
bit from that is the addition of
sandwich

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
sandwich
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
central part of the county
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
the green as you see on your sheets
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
and then along the eastern
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
part of the county down
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
to the base
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
this has a total all total overall
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
deviation of minus 3 to
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
positive 2.6 for 5.8
 
00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.790 align:start position:0%
positive 2.6 for 5.8
overall

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
comments on the carol
 
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.510 align:start position:0%
comments on the carol
commissioner

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:22.150 align:start position:0%
commissioner
map

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
i actually started to think why do we
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
have three all over the place
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
how did that happen but that's a
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
discussion for another day
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative wayne
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to point out
 
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.150 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to point out
that

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
we did not submit
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
no one submitted one on these counties
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
population change was not significant in
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
any of these counties so felt that it
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
was appropriate to keep them as they
 
00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
was appropriate to keep them as they
were

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
since the deviations all matched and it
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
seemed and we looked at the different
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
factors and decided not to submit them
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
so if we need to submit the existing
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
ones i think that would probably make it
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
a lot easier for people to understand
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
what the proposal is okay
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
because i have no idea
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
and i think it would be harder for
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
members of the public to understand what
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
proposed changes
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
because i know in my community if you
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
asked people what commissioner's
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
district they were in they would not
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
most of the people would not be able to
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
tell you right thank you
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
which should give you great faith that
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
then the next one i believe is cheshire
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
which the other representative smith was
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
going to speak to
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative turkite you want to speak
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
again it looks like
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
representative representative steve
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
smith has kept all of keene together
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
added roxbury and marlborough on to it
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
to make it a central district
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
then we have a northern northwest to
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
southwest district in green and a
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
pretty solid
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
uniform district in the southwest south
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
southwest corner of the county
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
the deviation
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
is minus 3.5 to 4 for a total of 7.5
 
00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.829 align:start position:0%
is minus 3.5 to 4 for a total of 7.5
overall

00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
and as i did not
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
do this map i can't speak to the thought
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
process that went into it
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative lane i'm going to let you
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
make the same comment i'm assuming on
 
00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:49.190 align:start position:0%
make the same comment i'm assuming on
this

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
yes i'll just make it for all of them
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
for one time so you don't need to well i
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
i actually don't think it's a bad idea
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
for you to just summarize it for each
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
because people may be watching and not
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
be watching for the whole thing or
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
coming in and out
 
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:07.109 align:start position:0%
coming in and out
um

00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
so do you want me to yeah why don't you
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
just quickly you can you know we did not
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
feel because there were in these seven
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
counties the population deviation didn't
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
i mean the population didn't change that
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
much so it was not necessary to
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
reallocate and redo the existing
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:34.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
all right so that cheshire any comments
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
on cheshire
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
anybody have any idea what the current
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
district is in cheshire
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
without looking it up madam chair i've
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
got it on at the computer here okay
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
for cheshire district number one is
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
chesterfield hinsdale surrey swansea
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
walpole westmoreland and winchester
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
which is the western edge basically
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
district two
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
marlboro roxbury and keene
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
so that's the same
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
right district three alstead dublin
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
fitzwilliam gilsum harrisville jeffrey
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
marlow nelson
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
richmond bridge stoddard sullivan and
 
00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.190 align:start position:0%
richmond bridge stoddard sullivan and
troy

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
troy
 
00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.349 align:start position:0%
troy
okay

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
all right moving on
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
the next one i believe would be grafton
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
that we have not spoken of
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
i've marked that as 7e representative
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair again we start by
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
keeping the
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
only only city together that is lebanon
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
added two adjacent towns
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
split the rest of the
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
county by population
 
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.150 align:start position:0%
county by population
northern

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
northern
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
and southeast and the deviation is 1.4
 
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:10.309 align:start position:0%
and southeast and the deviation is 1.4
percent

00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.319 --> 00:46:11.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
but i think it's messy again we did not
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
submit a map because uh the population
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
did not change that much in this county
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
and felt that the current deviations
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
worked um i will also add that we will
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
be submitting
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
seven new maps
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure when lindsay if you're
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
listening i know you're very excited to
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
hear that representative lane you're
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
fortunate you only need six because
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
stratfor county doesn't have districts
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair i i think representative
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
turcotte and i um would feel very
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
strongly that we wouldn't want stratfor
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
county not to be included as one of the
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
10 counties
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
in that case we can agree on on one map
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely actually i sort of want to
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
have two maps and start a discussion on
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
them and then see how long it takes for
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
people to figure out they're actually
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
the next one i
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
believe we have not discussed is
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i didn't really
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
work on this but i don't know why did is
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
there anybody else that would prefer to
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
speak to hillsborough
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative barry do you want to do
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
do you want to you're a rep from it from
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
the hillsborough district very proudly
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
from hillsborough okay thank you um i
 
00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.790 align:start position:0%
from hillsborough okay thank you um i
believe

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
county commissioner has not been a focus
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
of mine but i believe this is the same
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
as it currently is i'm not that we're
 
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
using that as a standard in any way um
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
but this uh
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
this keeps manchester bedford and new
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
boston together
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
um it keeps uh south
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
see i've got my east and west mixed up
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
for a second southeast hillsborough
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
county together with nashua litchfield
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
hudson and pelham
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of hillsborough county
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
is all in one district
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
and excuse me madam chairman supposed to
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
read the pub supposed to read the
 
00:48:19.599 --> 00:48:21.109 align:start position:0%
read the pub supposed to read the
deviations

00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
deviations
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
um but it's only the page here we go
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
3.9 that we have a three point a
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
negative 3.9 to a negative 1.1 or a 2.8
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
percent deviation overall
 
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.950 align:start position:0%
percent deviation overall
okay

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
do you want me to make the same comment
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah do you know whether hillsborough
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
do you know what hillsborough looks like
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
now i'm sort of curious i was just
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
eyeballing it against the list in the um
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
in the statute that
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
represented bergeron and quickly looking
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
it looks like it is the same so we might
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
actually have stratford and hillsborough
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
to agree upon
 
00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.790 align:start position:0%
to agree upon
excellent

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
the next one i believe
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
that we should discuss would be
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair that was one
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%

a north middle and south district so you
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
county is in one district
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
north to south is in one district and
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
the northernmost part of the county is
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
in one district and it has a deviation
 
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.589 align:start position:0%
in one district and it has a deviation
of

00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
drum roll please
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh a deviation of negative 3 to negative
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%

00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
breakup of the county um commissioner
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%

commissioners map
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
i think this will be the cleanest of
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
them all we have a
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
zero percent deviation
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
madam chairman i'd like to applaud
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte's presentation
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
if only that was it and we could all go
 
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.990 align:start position:0%
if only that was it and we could all go
home

00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
just in time
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
the last county commissioner map that
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
we're taking a look at is
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
and your multi-purpose chair
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
is now going to recognize representative
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
steve smith to discuss
 
00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.829 align:start position:0%
steve smith to discuss
the

00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh not a huge change i don't think so
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges we had was that uh
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
clermont lost some population and if you
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
look at the map you have claremont and
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
newport two relatively large
 
00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.990 align:start position:0%
newport two relatively large
municipalities

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
like a great big wall down the middle of
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
the county so
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is what we came up with there are
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
not a lot of ways to do it
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
claremont ward one and three are with
 
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.069 align:start position:0%
claremont ward one and three are with
newport

00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
newport
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
then pretty much the northern towns are
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
another district the southern the other
 
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.710 align:start position:0%
another district the southern the other
district

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
and we come out with a total 8.7
 
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.549 align:start position:0%
and we come out with a total 8.7
deviation

00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
deviation
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
this seems to make sense
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
we've got the larger municipalities
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
together and then the
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
the rural ones that may have a different
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
point of view on things particularly on
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
county allocations grouped together so i
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
representative smith we're not
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily using it as a criteria but
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
it would appear that some people thought
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
the current districts worked so another
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
map was not submitted we will be getting
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
another map to show the current district
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
would you happen to know what the
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
no not off the top of my head okay um
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
nope then don't go there if it's not
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
right we don't want to hear it i can't
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
tell you what i do know for uh for sure
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
though is that it is similar in that uh
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
most of claremont is in one and then the
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
smaller rural towns are in the others so
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
the concept is the same
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative porter yeah just out of
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
curiosity madam chair
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
because i'm new to this i'm looking at
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
claremont ward 2 having
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
4316 people
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
and then i'm looking at sunapee and
 
00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.069 align:start position:0%
and then i'm looking at sunapee and
goshen

00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
goshen
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
together which is pretty close to that
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering why the decision was
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
made to go to split up claremont where
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
we've been keeping cities together
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
um and and not
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
going the other direction i'm just
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
curious i'd like to know what the
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
thinking was there
 
00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.589 align:start position:0%
thinking was there
thanks

00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
go ahead it's representative smith if
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
you want to respond yeah i'm not sure
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
what you're getting you're suggesting
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
that sunapee and goshen be added to
 
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.990 align:start position:0%
that sunapee and goshen be added to
newport

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
newport
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
no that uh claremont ward 2 be included
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
with cl the rest of claremont
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
and matt goshen and sunapee would be in
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
that green
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh district rather than in the blue
 
00:55:31.359 --> 00:55:32.789 align:start position:0%
uh district rather than in the blue
so

00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
total these two
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
i would have to do the math on that okay
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
so okay i'm just curious
 
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.030 align:start position:0%
so okay i'm just curious
yeah

00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
yeah did it a while ago when it's the uh
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
the arithmetic always gets you by just
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
that much you know i don't know thank
 
00:55:55.599 --> 00:55:58.470 align:start position:0%
that much you know i don't know thank
you

00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
on this map representative lane i don't
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
want to miss my last chance so
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
we did not submit a map on this because
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
population did not change all that much
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the existing
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
deviations were appropriate and the
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
existing one keeps claremont together
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
with cornish to answer representative
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments any other
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
questions or comments on commissioner
 
00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:39.510 align:start position:0%
questions or comments on commissioner
maps

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
now that i have my maps all completely
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to go to representative
 
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.750 align:start position:0%
we're going to go to representative
district

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.109 align:start position:0%
district
maps

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
maps
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
and the first one we're going to discuss
 
00:56:55.839 --> 00:56:56.710 align:start position:0%
and the first one we're going to discuss
is

00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:59.589 align:start position:0%
is
merrimack

00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
there should be a merrimack in packet
 
00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.510 align:start position:0%
there should be a merrimack in packet
number

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.390 align:start position:0%
number
six

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.190 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
a merrimack
 
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:10.870 align:start position:0%
a merrimack
number

00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:32.950 align:start position:0%
number
10.

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
okay this is where your eyeballing
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
skills are really going to have to come
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
merrimack county we sort of had a dry
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
run of merrimack county at our last work
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
session so i'm going to ask
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire to again do us
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
the favor and lead off on going through
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
proposed representative district maps
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
very similar to what i presented a
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago i did listen to the
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
comments and make a couple of tweaks
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
pembrom pembroke gets its own standalone
 
00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.030 align:start position:0%
pembrom pembroke gets its own standalone
district

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
epsom gets its own district plus a float
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
and i also i also split the new london
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
district in half so that it's
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's two two town districts instead of
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
excuse me the deviation is
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
just under 10 percent on
 
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:49.670 align:start position:0%
just under 10 percent on
9.2

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay you rep the last town you
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
referenced i'm having a hard time coming
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
up with here
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
you talked about pembroke you kept its
 
00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.670 align:start position:0%
you talked about pembroke you kept its
own

00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
epson you kept its own and added a float
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
and what was the last comment you made i
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
split the new london district from four
 
00:59:06.319 --> 00:59:07.270 align:start position:0%
split the new london district from four
uh

00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
from a four town three rep district to
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
two two
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
okay questions for representative
 
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
the colors are pretty but with the
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
different multi-town districts and
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
floats it's still hard to follow
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
yes some of the floats are a little
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
larger than i would like
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'll particularly mention my district
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
but it
 
00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:48.390 align:start position:0%
but it
it's

00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
the numbers come out very nicely
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
and with
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
all these odd-sized towns that's about
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
anything else for representative mcguire
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
on this map
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's one of the tenets of running a good
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
meeting hand everybody a lot of paper it
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
i understand we have another map number
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
10 for merrimack county representative
 
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.270 align:start position:0%
10 for merrimack county representative
lane

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
lane
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
the proposed map
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
includes 32 total districts 25 base and
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
7 floaterial
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
with a total of 45 seats
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
the map keeps concord completely
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
separate from other towns
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
in a base and floaterial districts
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
which it was it which is not in the
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
existing map
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
the map also increases the number of
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
towns with their own base districts from
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
four to nine
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
and the total deviation for the proposed
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
map is 8.8 percent
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
do you want me to run through the
 
01:01:07.599 --> 01:01:09.670 align:start position:0%
do you want me to run through the
districts

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.349 align:start position:0%
districts
or

01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
give people time
 
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.030 align:start position:0%
give people time
so

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
let me people are still sort of looking
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
here okay
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
i was just thinking that representative
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
bergeron brought in crayons to help mark
 
01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.230 align:start position:0%
bergeron brought in crayons to help mark
up

01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
and that i don't think his crayon box is
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
big enough for what i would like to do
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
on this which would be to color code
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
each town from one to the other
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:04.549 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
and that box has long been decimated i'm
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
pretty sure i don't have all those
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
all right representative lane if you
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to go into more detail
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
do you want me to go through the list
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair i mean it's written in paper
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
and okay i i mean i can alright i mean
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we're doing okay so
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
let's just review what we're talking
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
about doing we have one or two maps for
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
every commissioner or
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
and two maps so far for every rep
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
district it is the intent to go to the
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
public input session with both maps next
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
week so there is no why the agenda
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
indicated something as to going forward
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
in a vote but it is the chair's intent
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
that both maps be brought forward um and
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
unless somebody makes a motion to do
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
something differently that's what we're
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
going to do and i don't really see the
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
need for a vote so
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
as we go forward that doesn't preclude
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
discussion on other maps certainly but
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
as far as what would be posted online
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
and for the discussion next week at the
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
work session we're going to work off the
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
it's bad enough when you're working on
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
one map at a time that when you get all
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
of them well i just felt like everybody
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
can read probably absolutely
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
i would point out that one of the
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
factors that we did look at was some
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
communities of interest and i know
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
that's not a
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
factor that we've adopted but we did try
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
to look at that as well
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
in in
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
in the merrimack map it's not perfect
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
and if anybody has suggestions great but
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.559 --> 01:04:00.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
any questions on either of the merrimack
 
01:04:02.319 --> 01:04:09.910 align:start position:0%
any questions on either of the merrimack
maps

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i i think maybe tomorrow what we'll
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
do is we'll have a follow-up first thing
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
about whether there are people who have
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
looked at stuff from today and there's
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
questions to go through tomorrow so
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
even though you've talked about maybe a
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
map you worked on today keep in mind
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
that i think that if members have
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
questions or want to follow up on
 
01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:27.190 align:start position:0%
questions or want to follow up on
something

01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
we should do that also tomorrow so
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
all right if i don't see anything else
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
from a member i'm not seeing any hands
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
or hearing any voices on merrimack let's
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
move to bellnap
 
01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.589 align:start position:0%
move to bellnap
belknap

01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
belknap
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
and it is the second map
 
01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:01.510 align:start position:0%
and it is the second map
in

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
as to the representative meant for
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
belknap why don't we go to
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte first please
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh belknap county uh for those you have
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
very similar to what exists now the some
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
of the towns down in the southwest
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
corner had significant
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh or i shouldn't say significant
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
population changes but enough to make
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
some of the existing
 
01:05:38.559 --> 01:05:41.270 align:start position:0%
some of the existing
districts

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
outside of the constitutional one man
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
one vote limit
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte is your mic on i
 
01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.589 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte is your mic on i
do

01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:05:51.599 --> 01:05:52.390 align:start position:0%
do
okay

01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
you want me closer there we go sorry
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
sorry christine i haven't been looking
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
at you
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
the county itself ends up with six
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
districts no
 
01:06:02.839 --> 01:06:04.470 align:start position:0%
districts no
floats

01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
floats
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
the deviation on the entire county is
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
minus 0.78 to 4.62 for overall deviation
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
of only 5.4
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
anybody who has worked on some of these
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
smaller counties such as belknap
 
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
with small populations and then
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
when if you have your
 
01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.670 align:start position:0%
when if you have your
allocation

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
map or spreadsheet in front of you you
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
belknap was going to get 18.49
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
reps which makes a small county with
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
small populations a very difficult
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
county to
 
01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:40.470 align:start position:0%
county to
do

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
but we were able to keep it
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
very similar to what we have today
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
laconia is all together
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
with the exception of laconia iv which
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
is with uh belmont as it currently is
 
01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:52.870 align:start position:0%
is with uh belmont as it currently is
today

01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh the only really major major change as
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
i said was down in the southeast corner
 
01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.150 align:start position:0%
i said was down in the southeast corner
we

01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
paired up alton with barnstead and
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
gilmington with belmont other than that
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
the county remains very very similar to
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
and i will just point out looking at
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
both maps i have the same color at the
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
sort of the top of the county and the
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
bottom of the county on each map so
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
so this is bellnap
 
01:07:25.039 --> 01:07:26.789 align:start position:0%
so this is bellnap
county

01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm do you want to
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
talk about belknap county that will be
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
map that's numbered eight
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
i would thank you madam chair
 
01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:36.950 align:start position:0%
i would thank you madam chair
uh

01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
my map is a little bit different uh the
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
proposed house map for belknap county
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
includes eight total districts so seven
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
base one floaterial
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
total of 18 seats
 
01:07:47.839 --> 01:07:49.349 align:start position:0%
total of 18 seats
and

01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
you know district one it's the same as
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
the existing district
 
01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.069 align:start position:0%
the existing district
two

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
meredith gets its own district of two
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
seats currently meredith's paired with
 
01:07:57.599 --> 01:07:58.630 align:start position:0%
seats currently meredith's paired with
guilford

01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
guilford
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
um only connected through the lake
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
district three
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
is samberton and tilton
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
so sambert and tilton currently share a
 
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
district uh but with two seats
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
fluterial was necessary to balance the
 
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.710 align:start position:0%
fluterial was necessary to balance the
populations

01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
populations
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
with this district in belmont
 
01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
sanberton and tilton they also
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
share a community of interest which is
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
something that i thought about with this
 
01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.390 align:start position:0%
something that i thought about with this
map

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
map
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
they both send high schoolers to
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh district four
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
belmont's a single seat district
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
belmont currently has its own district
 
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
of two members but a float's necessary
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
to balance the populations of samberton
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
and tilton
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
district five is laconia awards one
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
through five it's four seats
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't possible to keep the city of
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
laconia completely intact
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
this proposed map keeps five wards in
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
laconia together in a four-seat base
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
district and one word in another
 
01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.149 align:start position:0%
district and one word in another
district

01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
district six is guilford gilmanton
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
laconia ward six total of four seats
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
guilford and gillington send their high
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
schoolers to guilford high school so
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
that made sense as a community of
 
01:09:08.799 --> 01:09:10.390 align:start position:0%
that made sense as a community of
interest

01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
district 7 alton and barnstead three
 
01:09:12.799 --> 01:09:14.470 align:start position:0%
district 7 alton and barnstead three
seats

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
seats
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
both alton and barnstead send their high
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
schoolers to prospect mountain high
 
01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.590 align:start position:0%
schoolers to prospect mountain high
school

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh district eight is belmont samerton
 
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
and tilton two-seat floaterial
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
just to balance the populations there
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's why the float was necessary
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
between the two underlying districts
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
and total deviation for this proposed
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
map including both base influential is
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.789 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
questions

01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
comments on belmar representative
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
was that the only place that meredith
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
and guilford
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
touched each other was in the middle of
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
lake winnipesaukee
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
and everyone who testified
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
pleaded with us to separate
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
the two so that they could
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
so that the representatives could more
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
meaningfully represent their districts
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
and i am
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
as i was pleased when i first saw this
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
map to see that in fact guilford and
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
meredith have been separated
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't couldn't one argue that
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
being co-a butters to the largest
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
lake mass in new hampshire creates a
 
01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.709 align:start position:0%
lake mass in new hampshire creates a
huge

01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
huge
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
common interest between your communities
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
and that therefore
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
if that is the jointer point it is the
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
most important
 
01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:10.630 align:start position:0%
most important
point

01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
do we have a district with something
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
from the isles of shoals
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative barry uh two things i'm
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
number one to uh representative marjorie
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
smith representative marjorie smith's uh
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
point uh we actually fought a war over
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
the isles of shields called the maine
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
lobster wars um go look it up um and
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
number two to her point about the maps
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
um what we did here about meredith we
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
did also hear
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of testimony about the use of
 
01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.910 align:start position:0%
a lot of testimony about the use of
floaterials

01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
floaterials
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
people were paying attention at those
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
i expected this to go into this
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon folks but i think at this
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
point my intent is to go through these
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
and we're going to break for the day and
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
come back tomorrow morning we'll start
 
01:12:28.159 --> 01:12:28.950 align:start position:0%
come back tomorrow morning we'll start
off

01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.149 align:start position:0%
off
um

01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
seeing sort of recapping what we did
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
today and and clarifying what's
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
happened and then we'll go into the
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
remainder rep districts in the cd
 
01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.470 align:start position:0%
remainder rep districts in the cd
districts

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
yep no i'm just sort of letting
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
everybody know because i just looked at
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
my watch and
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
time flies when you're having fun but
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
not as much
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm madam chair thank
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
you i saw on the agenda other
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
submissions i'm curious what those are
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
and if there there are any it's the
 
01:13:01.679 --> 01:13:03.030 align:start position:0%
and if there there are any it's the
mapathon

01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
mapathon
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
well you you received something from
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
mapathon that was passed out
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
um at the beginning of the meeting but
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
this is a work session so if somebody
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
has something i'm leaving it open if
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
somebody has some a member of the
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
committee has something else that they
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
want to talk about they certainly are
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
free to do so
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
but the underlying purpose so you're
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
clear is that two maps will go to the
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
public input session as being the
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
products of this committee
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
so if you want it to be something other
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
than what's coming
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
as i guess at this point i can say one
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
side of the table or the other there's
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
going to have to be a vote because my
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
intent would be
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
public input sessions
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the first instance be driven by
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
whatever as
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
a committee we have presented with the
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you all to point out
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
during these meetings or the public at
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
the public input session
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
other maps that have been presented and
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
um everybody sort of has gotten their
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
maps done
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
very recently so i'm aware that not
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
everybody has all discussion points
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
ready on everything
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
so if some if you want to bring up
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
something else
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
we certainly can do it
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to move on to
 
01:14:18.159 --> 01:14:20.149 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to move on to
rockingham

01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
rockingham
 
01:14:20.159 --> 01:14:22.149 align:start position:0%
rockingham
rockingham

01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
rockingham
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
and rockingham
 
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative simpson you want to kick
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
this off
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
for rockingham
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
sure i'd be happy to
 
01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.870 align:start position:0%
sure i'd be happy to
um

01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:55.669 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
as you know i was not a substitute in
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
the last meeting so apologies if the way
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
i do this is um
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
is too
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
detailed and laborious but i was
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
planning to go up go through each
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
district that's fine as quickly okay
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
great thank you rockingham is sort of a
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
tough district so it is right and it's
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
got a lot of towns um
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate that
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
our guiding principles here are that
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
each town gets its own representative as
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
often as possible
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
districts be as small as possible which
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
also helps minimize barriers for
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
access to running for office
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
we prioritize small single seat
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
districts rather than the large
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts which we do have
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
a number of um
 
01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.070 align:start position:0%
a number of um
in

01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
in rockingham
 
01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.149 align:start position:0%
in rockingham
so

01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to hold up my map
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'm starting up here in the top uh
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
northern corner
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
so district one um
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
would be deerfield northwood and
 
01:16:00.719 --> 01:16:02.229 align:start position:0%
would be deerfield northwood and
nottingham

01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
nottingham
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
all together receiving three seats
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
and then district 2 right to the south
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
is auburn and candia
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
both towns do send high schoolers to
 
01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.030 align:start position:0%
both towns do send high schoolers to
pinkerton

01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
pinkerton
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
and they would have two seats together
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
raymond then is next door and would have
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
three seats that's the same as the
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
existing district londonderry likewise
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
is the same as the existing districts
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
seven seats
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
dairy 10 seats that's what is happening
 
01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:29.830 align:start position:0%
dairy 10 seats that's what is happening
now

01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
windham also has three seats which is
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
the same as the existing district
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
then salem
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
right in the far south has nine seats
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
which is like the existing district
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
now i'm jumping up over to
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
kind of the middle
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
the pink up here epping
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
has two seats which is the same as the
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
existing district
 
01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:56.630 align:start position:0%
existing district
and

01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
in this map brentwood fremont and
 
01:16:59.679 --> 01:17:01.270 align:start position:0%
in this map brentwood fremont and
chester

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
chester
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
would be grouped together with four
 
01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.709 align:start position:0%
would be grouped together with four
seats

01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
seats
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
now sandown this little purple one in
 
01:17:07.199 --> 01:17:08.950 align:start position:0%
now sandown this little purple one in
here

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
it would have two seats on its own this
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
is a new town that would receive its own
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
state representatives
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
danville right next door in orange is
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
the same as the existing district they
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
have one seat
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
hampstead would have two seats this
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
would be a new town that would get its
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
own state representatives
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
atkinson likewise would have two seats
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%

01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
base district
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's right there
 
01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.350 align:start position:0%
that's right there
um

01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
kingston and plaistow
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
in the light green there
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
would get four seats together
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
and then new fields in newmarket
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
jumping up to the north in that dark
 
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.270 align:start position:0%
jumping up to the north in that dark
pink

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
pink
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
they would have their own three seats as
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
they do currently
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
exeter would have four seats as it
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
currently does
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
stratum would have two seats as it

southampton
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
and blue at the south
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
would each have or would all have three
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
seats together
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
hampton falls and seabrook
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
would be the same existing district with
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
three seats
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
they do both send high schoolers to win

they do both send high schoolers to win
a

01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
cunnit district 20 next door which would
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
be hampton
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
and northampton
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
in green
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
they also send high schoolers to win a
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
connect and would have six seats
 
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.270 align:start position:0%
connect and would have six seats
together

01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
now up here to um the yellow piece is
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
rye and newcastle which are an existing
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
district now with two seats
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
greenland and newington and brown
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
would have one seat that's the same as
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
the existing district
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
and each of the portsmouth wards would
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
have one seat that's the same as what is
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
and then in rockingham there are a
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
number of flow cereals
 
01:19:09.679 --> 01:19:10.709 align:start position:0%
number of flow cereals
so

01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
district 28 would be a floaterial
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
composed of districts one and two
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
so this is kind of a big floaterial
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
in the north
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
corn the north west corner
 
01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.030 align:start position:0%
corn the north west corner
um

01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
do you see that it's all in blue light
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
and dark blue together that would be one
 
01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.070 align:start position:0%
and dark blue together that would be one
fluterial

01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
fluterial
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
district 29 would be another floaterial
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
this would be districts four and six
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
which i do not have these all memorized
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
would be londonderry and windham
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
down there in the south
 
01:19:46.719 --> 01:19:48.830 align:start position:0%
down there in the south
right

01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
there and then
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
district 30 would be a floaterial of
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
districts 11 and 12 which would be
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
danville and hampstead which are right
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
here in the middle
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
district 31 would be um a one-seat flow
 
01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.629 align:start position:0%
district 31 would be um a one-seat flow
terial

01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
terial
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
with districts 15 through 17 it's the
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
same as the existing district
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
which would be
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
newfields newmarket exeter and stratum
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
three of those four towns send high
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
schoolers to exeter
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
high school
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
and then finally
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
district 32 would be a two seat flow
 
01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.310 align:start position:0%
district 32 would be a two seat flow
terial

01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
terial
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
composed of districts 22 to 27
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
which would be portsmouth wards plus
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
greenland and newington
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
and all of those um
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
do send high schoolers to portsmouth
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
high school
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate your patience with that
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
and the total deviation for this map is
 
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
on the back
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
and it's a 9.98
 
01:20:56.159 --> 01:21:14.390 align:start position:0%
and it's a 9.98
overall

01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to add cross hatching
 
01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.550 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to add cross hatching
oh

01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah have those solid lines around them
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
which makes it a little bit easier but
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
yeah no they're there but yeah
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
you have to have your glasses on for
 
01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.390 align:start position:0%
you have to have your glasses on for
sure

01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments on this before
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so representative
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:47.830 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
rockingham

01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
rockingham
 
01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:48.870 align:start position:0%
rockingham
um

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
we'll just start out by saying we
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
were able to get 38 districts out of the
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
the county
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh with nine floats um
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
as always try to maximize our our
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
districts in each county it doesn't
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
always work but
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
when you have a big county like
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
rockingham it's a little bit easier i'd
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
like to point out a couple commonalities
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
um which is kind of interesting the
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
upper left-hand uh northwest corner
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh we
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative simpson's map and mine
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
both have a float with the identical 24
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
684 we just pair our towns slightly
 
01:22:26.719 --> 01:22:29.189 align:start position:0%
684 we just pair our towns slightly
differently

01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
then i would also like to note that
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
the east
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
part of the county from basically
 
01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.229 align:start position:0%
part of the county from basically
stratum

01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
stratum
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
to the east uh is going to be very
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
familiar to
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
the folks who gave us the packet this
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
morning so they will enjoy that so a
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
little commonality there i am not going
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
to go through and read all of them there
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
are 38 districts they're all listed on
 
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
the back
 
01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:53.830 align:start position:0%
the back
[Music]

01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
and we do end up with
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
nine floats
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
total deviation on ours goes from minus
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
4.93 to positive 4.86 9.8 overall
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chief
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for representative
 
01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:25.030 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for representative
turcotte

01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
all right i'm not seeing any
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
for us to parse this but
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:54.229 align:start position:0%
 
newcastle

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.239 --> 01:23:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.350 align:start position:0%
and
newington

01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
newington
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
newcastle and uh newington do not
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
um you'll so it's just going through
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
the portsmouth you need those two
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
portsmouth wards to do that that's
 
01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:17.830 align:start position:0%
portsmouth wards to do that that's
correct

01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
if you look on the uh the next page
 
01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:21.750 align:start position:0%
if you look on the uh the next page
after

01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me the map itself it'll it lays
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
out the districts yeah if you go there
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
and you'll see
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
so you split off two portsmouth wards
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's correct with newcastle
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
and as i noted before you would find
 
01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.510 align:start position:0%
and as i noted before you would find
that

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
the gentleman's maps in the back to the
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
exact same thing it
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
actually is a very
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
very solid
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
solid way to do it thank you
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
all right so the last
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative map we have scheduled for
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
today is
 
01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.750 align:start position:0%
today is
coast

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
coast
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
again in
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
packet six that should be the first map
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
and packet number nine representative
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair a very simple
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh explanation on this uh six districts
 
01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.470 align:start position:0%
uh explanation on this uh six districts
we

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
did uh absolutely zero floats
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
um we didn't uh
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
see the need for it by adding a float
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
just for the sake of having it
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
um you'll note
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
the districts they're there right for
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
you to see in the uh in the different
 
01:25:58.239 --> 01:25:59.189 align:start position:0%
you to see in the uh in the different
colors

01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
colors
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh one note that i didn't mention while
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
we do we were doing the
 
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.510 align:start position:0%
we do we were doing the
uh

01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
county commissioners is that
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
i was able to
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
mirror to to the biggest extent possible
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
the county commissioners
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
rep map
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
so you'll note that the
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
district in the middle berlin kilkenny
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
and jefferson mirror exactly the
 
01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:27.990 align:start position:0%
and jefferson mirror exactly the
commissioners

01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
and then the northern part of the county
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
and southern pound of the county were
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
mirrors not quite as much but very
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
similarly so this one again six
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
districts no floats uh overall deviation
 
01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.910 align:start position:0%
districts no floats uh overall deviation
8.68

01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
8.68
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
and uh please do not ask me to read all
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative

turcotte a question by mirror the
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
county commissioners maps you mean the
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
proposed ones not the current
 
01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.830 align:start position:0%
proposed ones not the current
that's

01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
correct other questions for
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay i'm not seeing any so we're going
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
to move on to the coast map it's
 
01:27:14.239 --> 01:27:15.430 align:start position:0%
to move on to the coast map it's
numbered

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
numbered
 
01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.510 align:start position:0%
numbered

01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%

01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative piedra thank you madam
 
01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.270 align:start position:0%
representative piedra thank you madam
chair

01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
our map appears very similar to the map
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
just presented by representative
 
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.750 align:start position:0%
just presented by representative
turcotte

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
turcotte
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'll also note that the map we are
 
01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.629 align:start position:0%
i'll also note that the map we are
submitting

01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
submitting
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
i believe is identical to the map
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
submitted by the good folks at the
 
01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.790 align:start position:0%
submitted by the good folks at the
mapathon

01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
mapathon
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
we do include a float in our map because
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
berlin is the only municipality that is
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
entitled to its own district
 
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
um in the county and so we did preserve
 
01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:54.070 align:start position:0%
um in the county and so we did preserve
that

01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and in order to do that we did create
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
a float
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
for the third seat in that area
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
but otherwise the map is very similar to
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:18.639 --> 01:28:24.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%

01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
map-a-thon map you have that
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
in front of you as a packet
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
