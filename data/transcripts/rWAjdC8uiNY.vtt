legislative term um for those of you who

have not been through this part of the
 
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%

recommend for future legislation or not
 
00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation but
 
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that however the
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
vote turns out it does not preclude
 
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
anyone from filing legislation so in
 
00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 align:start position:0%
that way it's
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
somewhat um ceremonial more than
 
00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 align:start position:0%

House and Senate um policy uh they from
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
there they then um once they vote on it
 
00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:13.479 align:start position:0%
it would then have to go through the
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee um and so they're
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
they're making that final push
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
um I want to stress that this
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
bill um pretty much would have created
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
what what they have been working on so
 
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
there will be another piece of
 
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
legislation that's needed um that will
 
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 align:start position:0%
be coming back to this committee at some
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
point so but there is no uh I will be
 
00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
voting and supporting the not
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation only
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
because this bill doesn't need to be
 
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
brought up again uh based on what they
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%

with that uh we will be putting forth a
 
00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh or no recommendation
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
but a recommendation for no
 
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation for House Bill 157 um but
 
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
that I'll close the executive session on
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
157 and open up the
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
the um the discussion the executive
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
session on house resolution 25 and
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
recognize our vice chair um for a
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair I would move
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
not recommended for future legislation
 
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
for house resolution 25 it's hard not to
 
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
say house bill isn't it um so um we have
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
a motion of not recommended is there a
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
second seconded by represent pres ative
 
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
discussion representative cers thank you
 
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair even though we may vote to not
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
recommend uh some form or fashion of
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
this bill probably should go forward
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
next year or the year after the the
 
00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
whole intent of the resolution was to
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
tighten up and confirm our voting for
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots uh for one point and
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
there was a second part to it I can't
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
recall exactly what it was but we were
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
trying to tighten up or the at least the
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
group behind the bill was trying to
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
tighten up the the voting laws as far as
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
what goes on in so we just don't have
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
every option or every means of saying
 
00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
you know I broke a fingernail I'm not I
 
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
need an absentee ballot so we were just
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
trying to say the Constitution says this
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
let's live by the Constitution and just
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
because it's not in the Constitution
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we should should be doing
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
it that's all thanks thank you
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
representative um your fingernails
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding um we are strictly
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
deciding whe not on and I'm glad you
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
brought that up because we are not
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
basing our vote today on the merits or
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
demerits of of the Bill of the
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
legislation itself um we are or the
 
00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
content of it we're strictly saying um
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
either we're putting this forward um
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
that there's something there that we
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
need to um look at but and it does not I
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
I need to emphasize it does not preclude
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
anyone from putting any other
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
legislation in or not uh later on so um
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your input um
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative uh do you have something
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
that I see writing so I'm assuming that
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's something else you would like to
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
add to that so we we saw a Supreme Court
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
decision very closely related to hr25
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
and the court wasn't particularly moved
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
by the arguments and the court sent the
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
case back to a lower court but just only
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
on the equal protection issues of that
 
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
case um thank you representative um that
 
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
is true there is uh there the reason
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
that we did set this aside was for um
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
for purposes of reviewing or or keeping
 
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
a close eye on the court case um um and
 
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
and because that court case hasn't been
 
00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
fully completed it may be very well that
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
they're that if this bill is filed again
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
that we may hold on to it again just to
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
see what the lower court does on that
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
one remaining issue of equal protection
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
but um but as it stands now um there
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
would seem to be very little reason for
 
00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
the bill in its present form and again
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
this is a house resolution which um
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
which almost um for some of us doomed it
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
from the start because that it only is a
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
statement for the house it doesn't go to
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate doesn't do anything else so
 
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
um I I see no reason for a house
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
resolution to come back to us with this
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
content um with that any further
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none um I will ask the
 
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the rooll on house
 
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
resolution 25 and again we'll be voting
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
on not recommended for future
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.269 align:start position:0%
