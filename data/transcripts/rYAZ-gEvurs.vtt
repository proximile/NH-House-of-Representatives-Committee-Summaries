00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
there you are so as I understand it this
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
grant is to administer an ongoing
 
00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
demonstration program
 
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.220 align:start position:0%
can you provide an overview of what new
 
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
is being demonstrated and how the
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
development will play out through the
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
September 2026 time frame
 
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
and when the program can be expected to
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
impact the general fund in the budget
 
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.410 align:start position:0%
impact the general fund in the budget
cycle

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
Santa nello associate commissioner so
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
for the first 16 months so we just were
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
awarded the funds the end of August so
 
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
for the first 16 months we're really
 
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
working on an operational to develop an
 
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
operational protocol so that
 
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.130 align:start position:0%
operational protocol so that
um

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
we can determine what we want to do for
 
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
services after the first 16 months what
 
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
do we want to enhance and so
 
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
any people that we transition
 
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.449 align:start position:0%
any people that we transition
from

00:10:31.449 --> 00:10:31.459 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:33.250 align:start position:0%
from
institutions

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:33.260 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
would not really impact the general
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
funds until after this grant award
 
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
um because we get an enhanced match for
 
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
those folks um through Medicaid
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
that's later on in the um
 
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.050 align:start position:0%
that's later on in the um
proposal

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
when you say through the grant award the
 
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
grant award goes through 2026 correct
 
00:10:54.899 --> 00:10:56.690 align:start position:0%
grant award goes through 2026 correct
correct

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
yes so then there'll be no impact until
 
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
after that until after that correct okay
 
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
and what what new might be demonstrated
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
so one of the things we're really
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
looking at in the first year is to
 
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
really understand
 
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
um the home and community-based service
 
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
system so that we can enhance that right
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
um for the for the um seniors that we
 
00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
serve in the state so we really want to
 
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
do some Gap analysis as to wear their
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
pockets within the state that maybe we
 
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
need to enhance home and community-based
 
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
services so more people access that we
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
want to look at some quality measures we
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
also want to really understand and study
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
what is needed for a nursing facility
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
beds within the state so it's really a
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
lot of research and understanding the
 
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
current Service delivery system
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you madam chair
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
so we've been we've been running this
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
program since 2000
 
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
seven five we had um an excuse me we had
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
it originally in 2007 and our program
 
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
ended in 2019 and then additional
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
federal funds were made available
 
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
um two states and so New Hampshire
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
qualified and and really what we want to
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
look at this round and in the previous
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
in the previous round we really looked
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
at okay transitioning people from
 
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
institutions into the community and
 
00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
really our Focus this time around us how
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
do we divert people and keep them in the
 
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:33.380 align:start position:0%
community for as long as possible
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so over that 12 years we ran
 
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
the program
 
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:42.260 align:start position:0%
we transitioned a total of 41 correct
 
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
individuals or between three and four
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
per year correct are we expecting that
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
this new iteration will be cost neutral
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
I mean because we've spent a lot of
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
money on three or four people a year
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it definitely because we're really
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
looking at how do we strengthen our
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
homing community-based service system so
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
people don't end up in nursing
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
facilities and final question sure do do
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
we actually have the workforce that we
 
00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
need to be able to keep people in the
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
CFI program so Workforce is always a
 
00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:26.210 align:start position:0%
CFI program so Workforce is always a
challenge

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and really what we're hoping to do is
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
through our
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
assessments and developing the
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
operational protocol will really
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
understand that better
 
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
so so this has very much a system of
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
care feel to it uh and whenever we talk
 
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:56.180 align:start position:0%
about system of care and uh the obvious
 
00:13:59.170 --> 00:13:59.180 align:start position:0%
desirability of building up Community
 
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
Based care supports
 
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:06.740 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm always left with the question
 
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
are these community-based supports going
 
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
to be sustainable we've been pumping a
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
lot of federal money into these programs
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
and so so I just want us to start to get
 
00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:23.459 align:start position:0%
our head around the future when it's
 
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's New Hampshire taxpayers again and
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
these programs and so it's a very
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
general sort of comment or concern can
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk to that
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
um I I mean I I think what we really
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
want to try to do is understand how do
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
we strengthen those systems because
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
we're spending the money for this
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
population regardless whether it's in a
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
nursing facility whether it's in the
 
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
Homing in in their own community and we
 
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
know the longer people can remain at
 
00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
home it does bring down the cost of
 
00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
institutional care and so how do we
 
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
shift in that direction
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
um and really develop what we need to do
 
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
to keep people for as long as they want
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
to be and are able to be safely at home
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
oh follow it all right so this is what I
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
think I want to hear you just said I
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
want to hear that you just said that uh
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
we're we are going to change the
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
optimization of the services so that we
 
00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
reduce our overall cost mix
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
and hopefully uh at the end of the the
 
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
the programs we will be left with
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
we want to work towards that and work
 
00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.459 align:start position:0%
together in partnership with all of our
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
partners to make sure that happens that
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
people can remain at home for as long as
 
00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
Senator Daniels
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to follow up on some
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the senator from Nashua
 
00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:09.019 align:start position:0%
um if this program started in 20 to 2007
 
00:16:16.449 --> 00:16:16.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
why did we not do any monitoring
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
you know in in that 12 years to
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
determine what changes needed to be made
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
to a system if you're only helping four
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
people a year
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
um we did do some monitoring the system
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
last time was really broad base across
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
all of the disability communities and
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
this is really focused on our elderly
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
and adult service system because we know
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
with the Aging number of people Aging in
 
00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
the state that we really want to focus
 
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
on this opportunity and and if there's
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
been more flexibilities actually with
 
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
this next round of funding that actually
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
includes people
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
um a shorter period of time to be
 
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
institutionalized and so Hospital
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
transfers and all of those pieces will
 
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
be super important
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
to expect the population that you're
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
going to be dealing with is the same
 
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
population as before or is it going to
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
be expanded and where do you expect that
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
that the health is going to be given
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
sure this focus of this round is really
 
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
on our elderly and adult service system
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
so those individuals who are
 
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
um eligible for the choices for
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
Independence waiver but really focused
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
on our older seniors in the state thank
 
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.950 align:start position:0%
on our older seniors in the state thank
you

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
could I have a motion to accept
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Bradley second second
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
this is on 339
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards on 339 yes okay
 
00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:02.100 align:start position:0%

chair the vote is 10 yay
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
motion passes 10-0
 
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
we now move to the when I was messed up
 
00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.020 align:start position:0%
on FIS 22
 
00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:39.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
represent Earth did you have questions
 
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
I did thank you madam chair
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
here we go so I'm
 
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
and I've really tried hard at this I'm
 
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
trying to understand where these federal
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
funds are coming from and what they were
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
for the explanation indicates that sabg
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
funds cannot be used to address alcohol
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
and related misuse
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
it also States a Governor's commission
 
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
made a presumably previous appropriation
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
to address this
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
a response to a question trying to
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
clarify where the front funds are coming
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
from referred to two fiscal nodes from
 
00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:20.419 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
fis21-232 and 21251 both of which as I
 
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
read them are sabg and thus presumably
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
not allowed for alcohol abuse
 
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
so I have two questions
 
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:36.419 align:start position:0%
the first is a compound question what is
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
the source of the funds being
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
transferred in this note
 
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
and what were these funds being
 
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:43.820 align:start position:0%
transferred originally intended to do
 
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
Beyond quote two I.T related
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects and the second
 
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
question I have relates to the note
 
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
itself are the payments actually to
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
all right I didn't take notes but I I
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
will try to address all of those
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
questions with um Nathan's help so for
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Katya Fox I'm the
 
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
director of the division for Behavioral
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
Health and for this particular item
 
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:15.059 align:start position:0%
their substance abuse block grant which
 
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
we receive from the federal government
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis is a certain amount
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
we received a supplemental block grant
 
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:28.100 align:start position:0%
as a result of federal action to
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
um pandemic and so they are restricted
 
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
but the funds that are restricted for
 
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
it's a little confusing so we always get
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
this block grant dollars they have
 
00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:46.370 align:start position:0%
this block grant dollars they have
restrictions

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
we in addition to the block grant
 
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.390 align:start position:0%
we in addition to the block grant
dollars

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
um we also receive state opioid response
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
funds those are the ones that are
 
00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
restricted from using
 
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
um to address the needs of individuals
 
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
who have perhaps an alcohol use disorder
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
versus an opioid use disorder and so the
 
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
reference there it's a little confusing
 
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
we probably didn't do a good job in that
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
explanation Sor funds are not at play
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the block grant
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
funds in this particular action with the
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
reference to the fiscal item that was
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
something that you accepted with the
 
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
supplemental and the other funds so
 
00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
that's the 250 that's referenced here
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
and I'll explain what we had intended to
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
use those funds for and then the 300 000
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
that is from the budget so those were
 
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
block grant funds that were in the
 
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.730 align:start position:0%
block grant funds that were in the
budget

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
okay so 300 000 was in the budget you're
 
00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:54.419 align:start position:0%
gonna explain to me where in the budget
 
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
and the other was where
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
so it was accepted that's the reference
 
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
to the dollars that were accepted last
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
year by fiscal committee which note
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
or so on on page one of the item that
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you you'll see uh
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
account the the last string of numbers
 
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
there 1981 the 250 000 that's what was
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
previously accepted via the fiscal
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
committee outside of the operating
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
budget can you tell me what fiscal note
 
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
oh what what fiscal item yes so
 
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
um that was fiscal item uh approved on
 
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299 align:start position:0%
September 17 2021 fist 21 232 okay hang
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
on so I got that yep and maybe I'm just
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting what is written here but
 
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
I thought it wrote here in this
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
particular note that sabg funds can't be
 
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
used to address alcohol unrelated misuse
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
to misinterpret that
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't have that right in front of me
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
but that's not the case so s a b g funds
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
can be used to address all
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
um substances that someone maybe have an
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
addiction to okay okay so the reference
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
was that because of um the one-time
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
funds we receive from the governor's
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
commission were used to address the
 
00:23:23.649 --> 00:23:23.659 align:start position:0%
needs of individuals at the doorways for
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
non-opioid related issues we are picking
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
up where the governor's commission funds
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
left off and using these funds which
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
have been identified and I'll get to
 
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
that part of your question if you'd like
 
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:40.700 align:start position:0%
me to yes so the 250 had been set aside
 
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
and when we developed these proposals we
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
have a short amount of time we have
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
brainstorming sessions within the
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
department to address what gaps are
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
there and so the original intent of that
 
00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
2 250 was to invest in what is known as
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
prescription digital Therapeutics and
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
that boils down to it is an adjunct to
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
treatment services and it's really an
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
app and it provides at the individual
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
level of physician the ability to see
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
how a patient is doing and so that
 
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
project never got off the ground so that
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
probably whatever it would have required
 
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.950 align:start position:0%
probably whatever it would have required
a

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh RFP a request for proposals and gone
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
through that process so those funds
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
didn't move forward for that purpose and
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
we're asking that they be repurposed for
 
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
the doorway unmet needs
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:50.220 align:start position:0%
seeing none could I have a motion move
 
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:52.740 align:start position:0%

or whomever
 
00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:03.419 align:start position:0%
to come up and talk to us about this new
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
program called sweep
 
00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:10.700 align:start position:0%
uh since um
 
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
this came to fiscal and there had not
 
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
been any
 
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
previous discussion about what the uh
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
object of this program was
 
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.649 align:start position:0%
object of this program was
uh

00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:27.799 align:start position:0%
some of the committee wanted to know
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to do sure so if we
 
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.730 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to do sure so if we
could

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the for the
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity so sweep and admittedly
 
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
we're running out of acronyms so I
 
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
apologize for that
 
00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:47.900 align:start position:0%
um sweep is designed as an initiative
 
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
within the executive branch some time
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
ago really to identify technology and
 
00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
other equipment Investments That might
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
be made in order to address efficient
 
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
system efficiencies and Workforce
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
efficiencies within state agencies
 
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
for that reason it was never really sort
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
of a single item like we bring typically
 
00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
it says this is you know one big item
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
with a whole bunch of uh awards that are
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
going to be made underneath it this is
 
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh an initiative that we have been
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
involved with from to the extent of
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
reviewing uh
 
00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:25.820 align:start position:0%
um um
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
requests from different state agencies
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
looking at them from the standpoint of
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
Eligibility under arpa and then
 
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
um determining which within those sort
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
of fit the uh the loose categorization
 
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
that we set up for this initiative and
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
then if there are other funding sources
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
that might be more adequate for some of
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
these they were urged to pursue those so
 
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
what you have today is a series of
 
00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:57.140 align:start position:0%
individual items from Individual
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
agencies each with their own individual
 
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.470 align:start position:0%
agencies each with their own individual
benefits

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
that are not necessarily part of a huge
 
00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:06.740 align:start position:0%
huge program
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
but are connected in that one sort of
 
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
concept of improving efficiency and
 
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
addressing potential Workforce
 
00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
challenges in different agencies by
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
using technology and equipment
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
I hope does that help I hope
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
are there questions uh representative
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
Edwards I think thank you madam chair um
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
uh first of all everything that you said
 
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
just now makes perfect sense I I think
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
it's a good initiative
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
I want to get to a layer or two deeper
 
00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:48.590 align:start position:0%
I want to get to a layer or two deeper
though

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
and because there are so many
 
00:28:54.649 --> 00:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
separate projects taking place under
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
this sweep umbrella
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
and they all generally have a similar
 
00:29:02.649 --> 00:29:02.659 align:start position:0%
objective of leveraging the technology
 
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
to save Manpower
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that there may be a need
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
or or or benefit to having an identified
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
program manager who
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
crosswalks the executive branch to make
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
sure that these these projects are being
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
done in a an appropriate way that
 
00:29:30.889 --> 00:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
there's metrics being established that
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to capture the Manpower
 
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
savings from anything we do that
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
somebody who really understands business
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
process re-engineering the the the
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
threat of applying technology to fixed
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
Manpower problems is that somebody's
 
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
gonna may try to just substitute
 
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:49.700 align:start position:0%
technology for people instead of
 
00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
redesigning the underlying workflow so
 
00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
so my concerns are kind of at the
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
Tactical level to make sure that we have
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
a competent program manager identified
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
who can crosswalk all of this and ensure
 
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
the best practices of business process
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
re-engineering are being used
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative I would say
 
00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
you know gopher has not relinquished any
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
of the role that it plays for any of
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
these arpa srf funds in terms of making
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
sure that there is compliance with the
 
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.490 align:start position:0%
sure that there is compliance with the
Federal

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
requirements that we are tasked with
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
making for all of these programs and as
 
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
such you know these are categorized
 
00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:33.419 align:start position:0%
within expenditure categories that each
 
00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:36.020 align:start position:0%
have with within those their own
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
requirements so on that level we are
 
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
absolutely continuing to be engaged as
 
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
we are with all programs that come
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
before you that are funded for sfrf and
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
work with those agencies to make sure
 
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:51.500 align:start position:0%
that they are meeting those requirements
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
in terms of specific outcomes I will say
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
that you know as it relates to this
 
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
initiative called sweep we don't have
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
anything in place right now that would
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
capture that sort of thing across the
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
different agencies just exclusively
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
because you know there are some
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
significant differences in the types and
 
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
then the goals of these types of
 
00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.789 align:start position:0%
then the goals of these types of
programs

00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
um I'm not saying it's not a good idea
 
00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:21.059 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying at this point we are we
 
00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
don't have that um plan in place
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
necessary to capture it now individual
 
00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:27.649 align:start position:0%
necessary to capture it now individual
agencies

00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
um as they get this these resources
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
um would be you know should be able to
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
be uh determine what those outcomes are
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
um along the lines of what your of what
 
00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:42.860 align:start position:0%
you're describing as individual agencies
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up so I have absolutely no
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
concern about us being able to spend
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
Federal money so that we're checking the
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
right box okay I'm I'm all about the
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
second part of your response which is
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
how do we ensure the outcomes are really
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
good because this is a huge investment
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
it's at least a significant investment
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
and we really would like to see those
 
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:09.620 align:start position:0%
positive outcomes I'm just concerned
 
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
that the decentralized nature of this uh
 
00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
in non-existent organizational structure
 
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
we're not making sure that we have the
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
right subject matter expertise spread
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
across all the Departments and and and
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
if we want in the future to be able to
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
say okay we just spent 14 million
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
dollars or whatever the total is would
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
you please explain to us uh how that
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
impacted our our Manpower requirements I
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know that there would be a
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
unified reporting structure under the
 
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
current decentralized approach so so
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's the outcomes and the subject matter
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
expertise to ensure that we invest this
 
00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539 align:start position:0%
money really smartly
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
so so but I I think I've heard you you
 
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
don't have a centralized program
 
00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
management function at this point but
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
maybe it's an idea that you'll think
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
about absolutely and and you know that
 
00:33:12.529 --> 00:33:12.539 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we can work with the
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
agencies to identify at least a key a
 
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
couple of key indicators along the lines
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
of what you're referring to we would we
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.009 --> 00:33:28.019 align:start position:0%
well uh thank you for that and and so if
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
you if you haven't want to have informal
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing conversations it's a topic that
 
00:33:36.049 --> 00:33:36.059 align:start position:0%
I I did a little bit of at Phillips
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
Medical Systems I'd be happy to I'd
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
welcome that representative all right
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
let me follow up with you thank you
 
00:33:45.649 --> 00:33:45.659 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions yes
 
00:33:48.169 --> 00:33:48.179 align:start position:0%
Senator Daniels
 
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
I would have thought and I I would have
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
hoped that in the job description of our
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
employees the pursuit of efficiency
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
would have been an ongoing thing
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
so I question I understand your
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
statement about that we don't have a
 
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
centralized one but
 
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.830 align:start position:0%
centralized one but
um

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
are we not trying to find efficiencies
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
within a normal job description as
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
um well I can speak to the extent around
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
the different initiatives under sweep
 
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
which are the goal of the program really
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
as as we said is for agencies to have
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
identified where they feel that they
 
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
could make some substantial improvements
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
in the sufficiencies for it for any
 
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
given system with an investment of
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
technology or equipment it's not neces
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
it's not designed to displace any
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
existing employees it's not designed to
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
you know displace any existing Workforce
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's designed to improve efficiencies so
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
um to you know as as it relates to
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
individual job descriptions and how
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
those are constructed I don't really
 
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
have a lot of say over that in different
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
grab Senator Rosenwald thank you madam
 
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
chair on it different but go for issue
 
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
um if if I could
 
00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
Services has done a fantastic job
 
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
planning for the end of the public
 
00:35:31.569 --> 00:35:31.579 align:start position:0%
health emergency when
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
automatic continuous enrollment in
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid will will end and people will
 
00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
have to be redetermined or
 
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
um lose Medicaid what are we doing to
 
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
plan for the end of the emergency rental
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
assistance program in advance of I don't
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
even know when that's going to be but my
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
concern is about the the clients and the
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
local welfare budgets which might be
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed at the end of it if there is
 
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.609 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed at the end of it if there is
not

00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:07.619 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
thoughtful plan follow
 
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
wind down action what what are we doing
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am well we're obviously very
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
close contact with HHS and with New
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing and others as we go
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
through this we have a number of
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
outstanding requests from the United
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
States Treasury for additional funds
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
under era1 and era2 we received
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
information from treasury just I guess
 
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
it was earlier this week indicating that
 
00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:36.980 align:start position:0%
they would let us know in a few days
 
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
whether there was going to be additional
 
00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:41.420 align:start position:0%
resource available under the program
 
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
so we're continuing obviously to monitor
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
the amount of funding that's available
 
00:36:49.569 --> 00:36:49.579 align:start position:0%
and how quickly that's being expended
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
with our partners at New Hampshire
 
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
housing but yeah I mean we're all
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
obviously very tuned into that issue
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you so with some of that
 
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
additional funding be used to create
 
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
um a wind down process or is it
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
there would be additional funding if we
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
got additional funding we would we would
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely be able to put some of that
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
into extending the services that are
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
available for people as we come towards
 
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
the uh the the end of the program so
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
that would be part of our plan okay
 
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
Senator Daniels thank you
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
um there there are three programs that
 
00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
that have been outlined here uh with a
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
statement that no federal funds will be
 
00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.609 align:start position:0%
statement that no federal funds will be
sought

00:37:40.609 --> 00:37:40.619 align:start position:0%
sought
 
00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:44.099 align:start position:0%
for that uh as far as the ongoing cost
 
00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
after those systems are put in place
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's always an ongoing cost whether
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's maintenance for software or
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
whatever so what can we expect to see in
 
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
the budget to support these systems that
 
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
you are putting in place going forward
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
it would be really hard for me to say
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
senator you know because these are
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
individual agency items uh the language
 
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
that you're referring to we would hold
 
00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:11.579 align:start position:0%
to that there would be no more resource
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
made available under arpa for these
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
types of programs uh I think they're
 
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
designed and submitted in such a fashion
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
that the resources that they've
 
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
requested under each of these individual
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
items would be sufficient to complete
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
the program I mean these are in most
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
cases Capital Investments uh
 
00:38:32.089 --> 00:38:32.099 align:start position:0%
infrastructure type Investments not
 
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
operational so
 
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
um I think that that question probably
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
would be best asked of the individual
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
agencies given the those are the the
 
00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
submitters of those items
 
00:38:47.569 --> 00:38:47.579 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thanks for what
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
you've given us already for information
 
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:00.500 align:start position:0%
but I guess in a follow-up to Senator
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
rosenwald's question the LBA has
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
prepared a document for us that they
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
give us every month showing how much
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
Federal money we've received over the
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
last biennium
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
and as you know it's over two billion
 
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.770 align:start position:0%
and as you know it's over two billion
dollars

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
have you you talk about well we're
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
looking to get more federal funds into
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
the program but have you prepared
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
something for the governor or anybody
 
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
that what if none of this money is
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
forthcoming the state's going to have a
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
huge hole to fill because this money is
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
going to stop as we all know so have you
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
prepared anything to warn us or give us
 
00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.829 align:start position:0%
prepared anything to warn us or give us
uh

00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
the information we need going forward
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
with the loss of these federal funds
 
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
well I mean I would say first off I mean
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
with regard to the 2 billion and I think
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
probably in the end that number is
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
actually higher than that if you include
 
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
cares act it's a substantial amount of
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
money obviously it's all been pretty
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
heavily bucketed particularly under the
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
arpa funds into many different types of
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
buckets so even within the era program
 
00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:07.619 align:start position:0%
and in the housing assistance program we
 
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
have era1 era2 and the housing
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
assistance fund Each of which have their
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
own set of rules as to how you can spend
 
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
that money so the challenge that we have
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
continuously had and I've tried to you
 
00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:22.270 align:start position:0%
continuously had and I've tried to you
know

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
illustrate is that due to the fact that
 
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
each of these have their own rules and
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
each of them have different funding
 
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
timelines each of them have
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
outstanding requests of differing
 
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
amounts of money and we're not able to
 
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
know from the federal government when
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
they're going to provide any additional
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
resources while we do monitor obviously
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
all of the funds that are available it's
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
difficult to say you know this is these
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
are the specific deadlines that we're
 
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
facing right now so
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
yeah we've done a good deal of work with
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing at trying to
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
predict when this outcome is coming but
 
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:02.420 align:start position:0%
again because we don't have really
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
solid numbers and timelines it's hard
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
for us to say yes it's going to be on
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
this date and when we get that we'll be
 
00:41:11.089 --> 00:41:11.099 align:start position:0%
able to do that I would imagine pretty
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
quickly based on what we have available
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm concerned you say you
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
don't have the availability because you
 
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
don't know when these timelines are
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to end so you're saying the
 
00:41:25.569 --> 00:41:25.579 align:start position:0%
federal government has not been
 
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
forthcoming whether these programs will
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
be extended or like I think we saw
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
recently 40 million dollars for rental
 
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
assistance if that ends
 
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
there are going to be a lot of people
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
either out of the street or landlords
 
00:41:41.089 --> 00:41:41.099 align:start position:0%
not getting paid I guess I'm concerned
 
00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:41.990 align:start position:0%
not getting paid I guess I'm concerned
that

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
we should have something more to prepare
 
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
us for what I think may be difficult
 
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
times ahead because this money is going
 
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
to end right and so there are deadlines
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
on when we can spend the money so era
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
one if we get additional funding under
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have to spend that
 
00:41:59.329 --> 00:41:59.339 align:start position:0%
by December 30th if we get additional
 
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
funding on under era2 we have a longer
 
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
time Horizon I believe out until 2023 or
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
4 5 for that for that funding and in
 
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
addition as I mentioned to Senator
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald we're going to add more
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
funding under those programs assuming
 
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
that we do get some to continue the
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
support services that have been ongoing
 
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
already with people that are receiving
 
00:42:26.569 --> 00:42:26.579 align:start position:0%
funds under this program it's not like
 
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
they're just getting this money and
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
they're sitting in their in their rooms
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're working with them to be able to
 
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
continue to transition them off of the
 
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
need for the assistance and New
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing and the Caps have been
 
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
doing a great job at maintaining that
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
constant sort of churn so
 
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
um I know it we certainly would love to
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
be able to say that there is a
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
definitive point at which we're going to
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
need to start thinking about how are we
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
going to transition people we are the
 
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
fact is that we're constantly
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
transitioning people and that as soon as
 
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
we're able to have some sort of sense as
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
to when we're going to see any
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
additional funding or not then we'll
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
make plans obviously based on that
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
information thanks thanks Venom chair
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh you thank you
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair I just want to weave
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
together my earlier comments with what
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
Senator Daniels added that on all of
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
these I.T systems many places it says
 
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
this is a one-time investment and I
 
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
think we should know that whenever you
 
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
invest in I.T in the olden days or you
 
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
had to budget like 18 percent of the
 
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
acquisition cost every year for for for
 
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
maintenance so it's it's not a one-time
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
expense it's a commitment to a forever
 
00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:48.980 align:start position:0%
stream of expenses maybe as much as 18
 
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
of the acquisition costs and then
 
00:43:53.809 --> 00:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
someday you got to replace it so so so
 
00:43:56.809 --> 00:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
because there's real money going out as
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
far as the eye can see on these on these
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
I.T investments in particular I just
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
really think it's important for us to go
 
00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
into this initiative ensuring that we
 
00:44:07.859 --> 00:44:09.490 align:start position:0%
into this initiative ensuring that we
are

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:09.500 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
influencing and reducing our demands on
 
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
Manpower hour
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise the money to pay for this
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
eighteen percent is going to have to
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
become incremental and that's and that's
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
where the bad budget outcome gets to be
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
so I I I want to I just wanted to make
 
00:44:28.609 --> 00:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
that point that it's really important
 
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
that we uh do these programs right
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
because we're going we're going to need
 
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
to find the money to sustain them yeah
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
no I agree and that is the intent of the
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
program is to make these as close to
 
00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
one-time Investments as we can in fact
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
as you've heard me say before in almost
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
every one of the programs that we bring
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
under sfrf that's sort of the the one of
 
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
the main one of the main points that
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to stick to in the
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
types of items that we're bringing is
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
that these are one-time Investments for
 
00:45:01.329 --> 00:45:01.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.339 --> 00:45:04.329 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:45:04.329 --> 00:45:04.339 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay thank you
 
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.270 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay thank you
um

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
we conveniently took uh FIS 22 351 off
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
the uh consent calendar
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
in order to hear what the Gopher office
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
had to say about these programs
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
so could I have a motion to ex thank you
 
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley do I have a second
 
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:40.260 align:start position:0%

we now go to um
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
FIS 22 359.
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
Governors uh authorization to accept and
 
00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
expend 20 million 22 503 dollars
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
in srf funds
 
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that someone in the senate
 
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%

all right so no questions all right I
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
thought there were questions dealing
 
00:47:13.849 --> 00:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
with how the community centers were
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
going to uh get word of this spot okay
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%

am sure the vote is ten to zero the vote
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
being 10-0 FIS 22 359 is approved
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
which is a request for 8 million
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:20.150 align:start position:0%
 
dollars

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:48:26.089 --> 00:48:26.099 align:start position:0%
somewhere in here I think we agreed to
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
bring forward the information item on
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
vaccines and uh if we're talking about
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
361 now then I think we maybe want to
 
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:42.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
I think we're confused what would you
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
like to hear first 361 or the
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
informational item the informational
 
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:17.339 align:start position:0%
changing chairs is always fun it's okay
 
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:32.589 align:start position:0%
this is a great time thank you
foreign

00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
apology is a little musical chairs there
 
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
uh so Madam chair members of the
 
00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
to come before you this morning to talk
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
about uh I think the important issue of
 
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccinations uh for the record
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
my name is uh Ben Shan I am the state
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist at the New Hampshire
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
could you pull your microphone closer
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
please oh I'm apologizing that's okay um
 
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
just uh saying that I am the state
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist at the New Hampshire
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh also on infectious disease internal
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
medicine and preventive medicine
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
physician uh several weeks ago I got a
 
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
request I believe some from some members
 
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
of this committee wanting to know um
 
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
more about the science and specifically
 
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
the scientific studies that have been
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
used to back up covid-19 vaccine
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations and so over the ensuing
 
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks I developed this um
 
00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:29.579 align:start position:0%
three and a half four page New Hampshire
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
science brief about the safety and
 
00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of covid-19 mRNA vaccines
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
I understand that the request was
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
primarily focused on uh data for
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
children but I did include in the
 
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
science brief uh all data that we have
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
been reviewing over the course of the
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
pandemic for children adolescents and
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
adults uh partly because that data is
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
important uh for informing also what uh
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
you know for the seeing the consistent
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
Trends in vaccine safety and
 
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness and all data has been used
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
to inform covid-19 vaccine
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations and so while this looks
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
like a long report the actual text the
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
actual science brief of it is only about
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
three and a half pages the rest are
 
00:51:19.089 --> 00:51:19.099 align:start position:0%
scientific references pointing to
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed journal Publications in
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
reputable scientific journals I did not
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
include any pre-print Publications which
 
00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
are studies that have been written but
 
00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
have not yet gone through the scientific
 
00:51:33.849 --> 00:51:33.859 align:start position:0%
review process by
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
peer reviewers and editors and so this
 
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
scientific brief really focuses on those
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
um reputable scientific journal
 
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
Publications that have come out around
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine safety and Effectiveness over
 
00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:50.339 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years of the pandemic
 
00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:52.460 align:start position:0%
since we've had covid-19 vaccines
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
available so I believe this has been
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
circulated ahead of time but I wanted to
 
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
be available to answer questions you may
 
00:52:02.809 --> 00:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
have about this science brief that we
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
developed or questions about covid-19
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
vaccines in general
 
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you your paper was very good
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
probably some folks didn't agree with
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
your conclusions but that's the way it's
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
been with covid-19 and uh
 
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
science or whatever so don't
 
00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:26.990 align:start position:0%
science or whatever so don't
um

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
it's okay we we all in this case there
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
are many different opinions but I
 
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
believe representative Edwards you had
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
some questions for Dr Chen uh I I do
 
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and I'm not just just to
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
clarify my questions are related to you
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
know the processes that we use within
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
the public health department I'm not
 
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
challenging the conclusions of of Dr
 
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
Chan I I just want to make sure that the
 
00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:00.500 align:start position:0%
public confidence is inspired by the
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
outstanding clinical research
 
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
capabilities we have in the department
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
and so in order to highlight them I have
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe about five questions or so
 
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.490 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe about five questions or so
um I

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:13.500 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
I think what people heard when they
 
00:53:19.609 --> 00:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
heard the saying that we should be
 
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
following the science what they thought
 
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
that meant was that there would be good
 
00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:29.540 align:start position:0%
clinical research done before a policy
 
00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:33.140 align:start position:0%
governmental policy mandate was imposed
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of people got
 
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
concerned because of the perception that
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
we weren't following the science we were
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
sort of reacting to the instincts of a
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
select number of scientific people so so
 
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
so I really am very glad that I that
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
you've come out with this paper because
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
I think this is a sort of the first time
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
we've put a stake in the ground saying
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
here's the science and this is this is
 
00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
and therefore this is our policy would
 
00:54:04.849 --> 00:54:04.859 align:start position:0%
you agree or disagree would you say it
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
differently yeah um thank you for that
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
question representative Edwards because
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
I think it's an important point to make
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
um we never and have never throughout
 
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
this pandemic just accepted
 
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
recommendations coming from from the
 
00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
federal government and particularly
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
around when it comes to medical
 
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.309 align:start position:0%
around when it comes to medical
recommendations

00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
um one one of the the key roles of
 
00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:26.579 align:start position:0%
myself and and several other clinicians
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
in the in the department is to review
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
the science ourselves and so that's what
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
we've done and so the the compilation of
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
the science memo actually is from uh
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
studies that we have collected and
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
reviewed in New Hampshire are studying
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
and looking at and reviewing the studies
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
that have come out around vaccine
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
science and the safety and the
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the covid-19 vaccines
 
00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
so that's where these 120 plus
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
references came from these are all
 
00:54:53.329 --> 00:54:53.339 align:start position:0%
studies that we have reviewed over the
 
00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
course of this pandemic
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
um and have have been used to inform our
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know adoption and support for a lot
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
of the covid-19 vaccine recommendations
 
00:55:05.329 --> 00:55:05.339 align:start position:0%
that are out there but you know this
 
00:55:07.609 --> 00:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
this applies to other areas of covid-19
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
response as well not just covid-19
 
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines we've always reviewed the
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
science and have uh which has informed
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
our approach that has sometimes deviated
 
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
from you know Federal guidance on on a
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
number of matters but when it comes to
 
00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines I think the the data
 
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
and the science is overwhelmingly clear
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
multiple studies as I highlighted in
 
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
this report that the vaccines are safe
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
even for children and to maintain High
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness particularly against more
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
severe disease and also long-term
 
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
complications of 19 which I also
 
00:55:42.049 --> 00:55:42.059 align:start position:0%
highlight in the in the science brief
 
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
the the only other point I wanted to
 
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
make is that at a federal level I think
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
people need to be aware that it's not
 
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.370 align:start position:0%
people need to be aware that it's not
just

00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
um Federal politicians or bureaucrats so
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
to speak or federal employees I should
 
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
say that are coming out with these
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
guidelines and recommendations
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to vaccine
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
recommendations and this is one of the
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
key roles of the what we call acip the
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
advisory committee on immunization
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
practices which helps to create all of
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
the recommendations for all childhood
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
vaccination series these are not federal
 
00:56:17.569 --> 00:56:17.579 align:start position:0%
employees these are a group of medical
 
00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
professionals people with expertise and
 
00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
vaccines who come together to review the
 
00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
science and to make determinations and
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
make recommendations about vaccine
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations you know it's it's a
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
medical group so the the acip
 
00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
supports the federal guidance that comes
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
out helps to develop that Federal
 
00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
guidance so it's not just federal
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
employees or federal politicians that
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
are coming out with the guidance at a
 
00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
federal level but certainly at a local
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
level we we take our responsibility for
 
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
similarly reviewing the guidance um
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
seriously similar to what the the acip
 
00:56:57.049 --> 00:56:57.059 align:start position:0%
does at a federal level
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
um would you agree that any of these
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
studies should be subject to a
 
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
scientific method and and what I
 
00:57:08.569 --> 00:57:08.579 align:start position:0%
consider the scientific method and you
 
00:57:10.809 --> 00:57:10.819 align:start position:0%
could educate me if I'm wrong
 
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
is that a hypothesis gets identified a
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
research trial is put together the data
 
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
is gathered and analyzed and and the key
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
to good scientific inquiry is repeat
 
00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.630 align:start position:0%
to good scientific inquiry is repeat
repeatability

00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
repeatability
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
and uh and and with repeatability comes
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
the uh a power or the opportunity to
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
refute and disagree with the results to
 
00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
to to challenge the scientific inquiry
 
00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
process would would you describe would
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
you agree or say it different about the
 
00:57:50.089 --> 00:57:50.099 align:start position:0%
scientific method yeah I think the
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
scientific method has been proven over
 
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
and over again to be important and
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
reliable and part of that is defining
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
defining what you're studying and then
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
the study outcomes and that does need to
 
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
be repeatable and so I think what we
 
00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:07.140 align:start position:0%
have seen with the kova 19 vaccine
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
literature the scientific Publications
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
is you know and I tried to highlight
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
this in the science brief over and over
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
again multiple Studies have found
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
consistent findings both between adult
 
00:58:20.809 --> 00:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
adults and children and across multiple
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
studies of repeatable findings that
 
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
these vaccines are are safe and
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
effective I I will also say that there
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
are differences in quality of studies so
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's not just about any one particular
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
study it's about the type of study is it
 
00:58:38.289 --> 00:58:38.299 align:start position:0%
a randomized double-blinded
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
placebo-controlled clinical trial or is
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
it what we call a higher level
 
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
ecological study that has um usually we
 
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
have lower confidence in findings of
 
00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:51.299 align:start position:0%
studies that are not well designed or
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
not as rigorous so so this highlights I
 
00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
think the importance not only of the
 
00:58:58.130 --> 00:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
study and study design pain but also to
 
00:58:59.690 --> 00:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
what you say is that the repeatability
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
um well thank you for that so
 
00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:07.849 align:start position:0%
um well thank you for that so
um

00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
so that takes me to the the Florida
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
question which is
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
um evidently I'm a Layman I've worked
 
00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:18.780 align:start position:0%
around you know academics so I kind of
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
understand what they've done but I I've
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
only been a poor role but but as I've as
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
I've taken a look at what Florida is
 
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
coming up with and the kind of
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines they're coming up with with
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
the the the demographics of uh kids six
 
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
months and older the demographics
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
between I don't know if it's five to
 
00:59:38.569 --> 00:59:38.579 align:start position:0%
eleven or five to Seventeen I forget the
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
end point and then even recently they
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
said men ages 18 to 39 that none of
 
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
those three demographic groups really
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
ought to be thrown into the category of
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
default taking of the the coven shot and
 
00:59:58.970 --> 00:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
because their conclusion is so much
 
01:00:02.569 --> 01:00:02.579 align:start position:0%
different than our own in 361 we we make
 
01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
a very categorical statement
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
um on on page three that the Department
 
01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
recommends that all persons six months
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
of age or older complete the covid-19
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
primary series and boost your
 
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
vaccination when eligible
 
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
so so our conclusion is very strong very
 
01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
strong and very different than Florida
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
and so can you can you explain you know
 
01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:30.980 align:start position:0%
the extent to which you you look at
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
contrary opinions and you use it to you
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
know second guess yourself not so that
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
people like me aren't second-guessing
 
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
you but that you've got your own process
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative thanks for that
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
question and I think it's an important
 
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
um point an important question to make
 
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
because there has been a lot of
 
01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.950 align:start position:0%
because there has been a lot of
confusion

01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:00:51.049 --> 01:00:51.059 align:start position:0%
um you know and I think there's been
 
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
multiple instances where I think the
 
01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
public uh in general even providers have
 
01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
been confused because of differing
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations coming out from
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
different states throughout the pandemic
 
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
not not related necessarily to covid-19
 
01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.210 align:start position:0%
not not related necessarily to covid-19
vaccines

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
um I will say that when it when it comes
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
to kova 19 vaccine recommendations
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
um you know I am aware of Florida's
 
01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
guidance it was sent to me ahead of this
 
01:01:13.849 --> 01:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
meeting so I did have a chance to review
 
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
it particularly for their guidance for
 
01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:18.299 align:start position:0%
Pediatric vaccines which I have in front
 
01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
of me here I printed it out there in the
 
01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:24.059 align:start position:0%
minority I I am not uh I my
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the vast majority
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
of other public health jurisdictions
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
across the state across the country
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
um are in alignment and in agreement
 
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
with the the guidance and the
 
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
recommendations that have come out from
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
the CDC and acip the advisory committee
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
on immunization practices and it's not
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
just adopting these guidelines from the
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
fed from the feds by default there's
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
there's science to back it up when I
 
01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:50.339 align:start position:0%
looked at Florida's guidance you know my
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
concern is that this is not appropriate
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
guidance uh it's not appropriate medical
 
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
guidance because it's not evidence-based
 
01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.010 align:start position:0%
guidance because it's not evidence-based
guidance

01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
um you know they they reference several
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
studies in their guidance but if you
 
01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:05.099 align:start position:0%
actually click on those studies and go
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
into review and see what those studies
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
are actually saying those studies are
 
01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
not actually supporting their
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
conclusions and so this guidance is my
 
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
opinion not evidence-based and it's not
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
backed up by the vast majority of the
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
science out there which has shown
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
vaccines repeatedly to be safe and
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
effective and the conclusions that
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
they're drawing from some of the studies
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
that are linked in their guidance are
 
01:02:29.809 --> 01:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
not are not actually are is just simply
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
not appropriating so just as an example
 
01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
um one of their points uh in which they
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
sort of come out less strongly if I can
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
put it that way against covid-19
 
01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:42.299 align:start position:0%
vaccines and kids they talk at one of
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
their bullet points here is limited risk
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
of severe illness due to covid-19 in
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
children and they reference a study but
 
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
that's not actually what the study is
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
studying if you click on the link the
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
the study that they reference is about
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
the evaluation of the Pfizer vaccine in
 
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
children 5 to 11 years of age so so you
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
can't actually draw that conclusion from
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
the study that is referenced in order to
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
look at severe illness from covid-19 in
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
children you need to study this design
 
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:11.339 align:start position:0%
to look at severe illness in children
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
and not studying vaccine Effectiveness
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
in children and actually that studies
 
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
conclusions are that the Pfizer vaccine
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
in children is found to be safe
 
01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.510 align:start position:0%
in children is found to be safe
immunogenetic

01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
immunogenetic
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
immunogenic and efficacious in children
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
5 to 11 to 11 years of age so so that's
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
just one example where I don't think
 
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
that Florida's guidance is is
 
01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
evidence-based or appropriate based on
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
what their what they're referencing here
 
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
for studies so just to clarify somebody
 
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
May misinterpret your initial couple of
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
sentences to imply that its majority
 
01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
rules on science and I don't think you
 
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
meant to say that at all you just gave
 
01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:51.059 align:start position:0%
us an extremely long explanation of the
 
01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:53.339 align:start position:0%
body of the evidence and the number of
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
you know repeat examples so I just I
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
just didn't want you misunderstood about
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
majority rules on scientific issues now
 
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh earlier today I had a chance to chat
 
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
with Dr Ballard and and Ms Tilly and
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
they they pointed out multiple instances
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
where the department
 
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
has differed in its opinions from what
 
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
the CDC was promulgating and uh and I I
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
think that's kind of an interesting
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
topic because it may help demonstrate
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
sort of the independence of thought and
 
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:30.839 align:start position:0%
the thoroughness of of what we're
 
01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
investing into the process can you can
 
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
you maybe give us an example and and
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
talk about uh you know sort of New
 
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as as an independent thought
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
leader in this area yeah thanks for that
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
question would you like examples just
 
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
related to covid-19 vaccines or other
 
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
examples let's stay on topic just and if
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
you got a six-month-old example that
 
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
would be really great but you probably
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
don't yeah um you know thank you thank
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
you for that uh thank you for that for
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
that question and I think there have
 
01:04:59.930 --> 01:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
been multiple examples throughout the
 
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic where we've differed
 
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
um or come out with our own guidance all
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic um either
 
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
because it the guidance wasn't there at
 
01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
a federal level or it wasn't there on
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
time or we disagreed with it
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
um you know relative to vaccines you
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
know I think there are a number of
 
01:05:15.059 --> 01:05:16.750 align:start position:0%
know I think there are a number of
instances

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
instances
 
01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
throughout the last you know two years
 
01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
of the the pandemic maybe the first
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
example I'll point to is going back to
 
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
January of 2021 if I can go back that
 
01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
far in my memory when vaccines had just
 
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
started to roll out
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
um and uh we had focused vaccines for
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
those at highest risk for severe disease
 
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
and older adults who me um and excuse me
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
and Health Care Health Care workers who
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
are on the front lines
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
um and just one example of applying
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
vaccine science to our guidance there
 
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
was an intense discussion come January
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
about whether we were going to still
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
require people who were fully vaccinated
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
who had gotten the primary series to
 
01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:02.420 align:start position:0%
quarantine after an exposure
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
and we in New Hampshire were pushing
 
01:06:07.849 --> 01:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
hard for that for the federal government
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
to take the step of not you know
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
recommending quarantine for people who
 
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
are fully vaccinated to quarantine for a
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
few reasons one because the data at that
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
time was showing that the vaccines were
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
highly effective at preventing disease
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
like 94 95 percent effective at
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
preventing disease keys and with a
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
vaccine that that's that effective we
 
01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
didn't see a need to still you know
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
require people to quarantine we were
 
01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:35.339 align:start position:0%
actually one of the first states in the
 
01:06:35.339 --> 01:06:36.650 align:start position:0%
actually one of the first states in the
country

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
um to come out and make the
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation that people who are fully
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
vaccinated were not required to
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
quarantine after an exposure
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
um and it took the the federal
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
government the CDC one to two months
 
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
longer to come out with that
 
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.230 align:start position:0%
longer to come out with that
recommendation

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
um for for whatever reason I can't speak
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
to exactly you know we were having
 
01:06:56.089 --> 01:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
discussions with CDC about the time
 
01:06:58.730 --> 01:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
around about this around the time but
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
that that was one of the earliest
 
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
examples of you know we were looking at
 
01:07:03.529 --> 01:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
the vaccine science and the vaccine data
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
and using it to inform our approach and
 
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.130 align:start position:0%
and using it to inform our approach and
recommendations

01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the early earliest of which
 
01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
was not requiring people to quarantine
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
after an exposure
 
01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
um they were right around the time a
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine rollout the federal government
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
was coming out with guidance about who
 
01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
should get vaccinated first
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
um particularly with limited vaccine you
 
01:07:24.049 --> 01:07:24.059 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire as with many other
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
states you know came up with our own
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
strategy we had a whole team working on
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
that vaccine allocation strategy
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
more more recently with the the rollout
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
of the Omicron boosters we have uh we
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
have so the recommendation now is that
 
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
as long as somebody is at least two
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
months and this is a little bit of a
 
01:07:51.529 --> 01:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
detail that maybe is not that important
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
but highlights the example the
 
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
recommendation has been that people who
 
01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
are at least two months out since their
 
01:07:59.930 --> 01:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
last dose of the vaccine
 
01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
the older version of the vaccine are
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
eligible for one of these updated
 
01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
Omicron boosters
 
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
um that that's a p a detail in the
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation that I generally don't
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
agree with I think that's too short of a
 
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
time frame I don't think there's a
 
01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
safety concern with somebody getting
 
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated two months after their last
 
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
dose I just think it's unnecessary and
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
it doesn't optimize the effectiveness of
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
the vaccine and so we we have put out
 
01:08:24.769 --> 01:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
guidance in some of our health alert
 
01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:27.299 align:start position:0%
Network messages and publicly suggesting
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
that people wait you know a longer
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
period of time between infection or
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
prior vaccination and getting one of the
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
updated Omicron boosters in order to
 
01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.269 align:start position:0%
updated Omicron boosters in order to
optimize

01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
optimize
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
the protective effect of these updated
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
booster doses so those are just a few
 
01:08:42.239 --> 01:08:43.490 align:start position:0%
booster doses so those are just a few
examples

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
examples
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
um you know some some more pertinent and
 
01:08:50.329 --> 01:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
all right um so so we're spending a lot
 
01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
of time in a fiscal committee on this
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
but I I think I think it's I think it's
 
01:08:59.689 --> 01:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
worthwhile because we're coming out of
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
two and a half
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
years of the pandemic and this is really
 
01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:06.299 align:start position:0%
the first example that I can recall
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
where we've we've published the science
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
to the public and said our policy is
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
supported by the science we're sharing
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
with you which I hope in the after
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
action review is annotated as something
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
for the future that we we are more
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
proactive in getting the science put in
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
front of the public so they can
 
01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
understand any of the policies we're
 
01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
implementing so so with all of
 
01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
everything you've said I my concern is
 
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
still on page three of 361 and there's a
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
particular sentence in there that I just
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that you you agree and
 
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
support it and I think Miss Tilly can
 
01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
stick your your finger on it the the the
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Health and
 
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
Human Services
 
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
recommends that all persons six months
 
01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
of age or older complete the covid-19
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
primary series and booster vaccination
 
01:10:05.209 --> 01:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
when eligible a reformulated booster
 
01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
which is currently available to
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
individuals 12 years of age or older
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
will offer enhanced protection against
 
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
covid-19 is is this is this possibly an
 
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
over promise a too strong a
 
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
recommendation or do you stand by this
 
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.669 align:start position:0%
recommendation or do you stand by this
literally

01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
literally
 
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
can I can I see the wording again since
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
you're asking about literal
 
01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:29.570 align:start position:0%
you're asking about literal
um

01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
what what uh is there a specific section
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
there that you are concerned about well
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's I I I just read it it's from page
 
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
three of um 361 down underneath the
 
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
table underneath the term vaccination
 
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
and testing services there's a two
 
01:10:51.169 --> 01:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
sentence paragraph yeah so so so yes I
 
01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
think we we stand We Stand by that
 
01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.229 align:start position:0%
think we we stand We Stand by that
recommendation

01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly there are a uh
 
01:10:58.750 --> 01:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
some minority of people
 
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
them that may not be eligible to get the
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine because of a medical
 
01:11:04.679 --> 01:11:06.770 align:start position:0%
vaccine because of a medical
contraindication

01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
contraindication
 
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
certainly those people shouldn't be
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and there's there's guidance
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
for who shouldn't get vaccinated
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
um but but everybody else
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
um you know it continues to be our
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
recommendation that everybody else six
 
01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
months of age and older be vaccinated
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
now I I do want to acknowledge that
 
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
certainly children are at lower risk for
 
01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
severe disease severe outcomes from
 
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
covid-19 but it's not true that they're
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
at no risk and so I think that the the
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
data even in children consistently shows
 
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
that vaccine even in otherwise healthy
 
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.130 align:start position:0%
that vaccine even in otherwise healthy
children

01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:42.140 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine offers important protection
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
against covid-19 against kova 19 in the
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
short term we're talking over several
 
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.530 align:start position:0%
short term we're talking over several
months

01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
um over protection against severe
 
01:11:56.209 --> 01:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
disease in the longer term and then
 
01:11:58.810 --> 01:11:58.820 align:start position:0%
potentially you know protection against
 
01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
some of the longer term complications
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
that that can arise from covet 19. I
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
mean we're we're seeing more and more
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
studies come out for example showing an
 
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
association between covid-19 disease
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
covid-19 infection and diabetes right I
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
mean diabetes is a lifelong medical
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
complication now we can't predict who's
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
going to come down with complications of
 
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
covid-19 right some people will get
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and have very mild illness and
 
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
get over it have no problems other
 
01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
people can have covid-19 children
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
included develop multi-system
 
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
inflammatory syndrome end up in the
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
hospital die get long coveted develop
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
diabetes certainly that the risk of that
 
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
happening in children is lower but we
 
01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
can't predict uh who who's going to
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
develop those complications and who
 
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.209 align:start position:0%
develop those complications and who
isn't

01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
um and the the data in adults in
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
adolescents and children has been clear
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the vaccines are safe the vaccines
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
are effective and that um uh any any you
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
know potential side effects from the
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
vaccines are usually short-lived due to
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
the body's reaction to the vaccine uh
 
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
and that the the benefits of vaccination
 
01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
even in children outweigh
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
um potential side effects
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and uh thank
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
you Dr Chan and your colleagues for your
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
service to the state I appreciate you uh
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
working on this so hard and sharing it
 
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
with us thanks my pleasure thank you for
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions uh
 
01:13:33.169 --> 01:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley
 
01:13:33.179 --> 01:13:34.010 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley
foreign

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so going back to
 
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
what you told the Health and Human
 
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
Services committee several months ago Ms
 
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:43.610 align:start position:0%
Services committee several months ago Ms
Tilly

01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
Tilly
 
01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
um obviously the department recommends
 
01:13:49.209 --> 01:13:49.219 align:start position:0%
but there is
 
01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
no initiative on the Department's part
 
01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
to go forward with the gel Car
 
01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
application to require a vaccine for
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
school-aged children or children
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
attending daycare is that still correct
 
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Bradley that is
 
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
correct we are not moving forward with
 
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
any recommendation for mandatory vaccine
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
for covid-19 for school or Child Care
 
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.030 align:start position:0%
for covid-19 for school or Child Care
entry

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
entry
 
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
can I um I'm sorry madam chair and if I
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
can also comment um there there was a I
 
01:14:21.169 --> 01:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
forget the the committee that um this
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
question has come up at about
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
um School School requirements for
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
vaccines that uh I think we we had a
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
similar discussion at
 
01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to add uh to what
 
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
director Tilly said that that the
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
Covenant it's looking like the covid-19
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine will turn into probably an
 
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
annual booster right I mean I mean the
 
01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
the science the data is still out on
 
01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:42.770 align:start position:0%
the science the data is still out on
that

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
um but it's not the type of vaccine
 
01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
which we would require or add to the
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
required list for childhood vaccination
 
01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
series for entry into school or child
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
care because because partly because
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
we're expecting it to turn into an
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
annual vaccine just like we don't
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
require the flu vaccine every year
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
there's no plans at this point to add
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 vaccine which is looking
 
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
like it's going to be an annual vaccine
 
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
to the required list
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
um both both because of you know the
 
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
properties of of That vaccine and just
 
01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
the logistical hurdles of trying to you
 
01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
know have a school verify a child a
 
01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
student is vaccinated every year is just
 
01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:24.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Daniels
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Dr Chen on the references
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
that you provide of the 125 references
 
01:15:36.169 --> 01:15:36.179 align:start position:0%
are they all supportive of your position
 
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
or are there some in there that are
 
01:15:42.169 --> 01:15:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
um well so the the the references are
 
01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
linked to specific statements throughout
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
the document and so those those
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
references are supportive of the
 
01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
statements that are made throughout the
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
document that the references are are
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
linked to
 
01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think the the overall
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
conclusion also of those studies
 
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
um is uh it is supportive of what I've
 
01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not sure you answered the
 
01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
question so in in the references that
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
you provided here they are supportive of
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
your statement the same vaccines are
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
safe and effective my question is are
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
there studies that you looked at
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
that you have included in this list that
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
um I I would have to pull up specific
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
studies but
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to think back through the
 
01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.490 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to think back through the
studies

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
studies
 
01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:35.470 align:start position:0%
studies
um

01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:38.169 --> 01:16:38.179 align:start position:0%
no I think I think the studies are all
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
particularly around vaccine safety are
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
all supportive of that statement
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and uh if you if you have
 
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
a specific example that you're that you
 
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
find I'm happy to sort of review or talk
 
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
through that study but you know again
 
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
pulling from my memory here well I think
 
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
the chair started out by saying that
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
people have very various opinions
 
01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
on on vaccines so you know I wondered if
 
01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking at a paper that's
 
01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
got 125 references that are basically
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to be lopsided versus there may be
 
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
other studies in there that have an
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
opinion that is contrary to the
 
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
statement that they are safe and
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
effective uh for instance uh you know
 
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
how do you explain to someone whose
 
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
child uh has had adverse effects by
 
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
having a vaccine even to the point of
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
Dying by telling them that it's safe and
 
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
effective yeah and and thanks for asking
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
that question because I think it is
 
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
important to separate science and
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
studies from opinion
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
um and so I certainly recognize the fact
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
that different people have different
 
01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.830 align:start position:0%
that different people have different
opinions

01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
opinions
 
01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
um but but again I think the the the
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
data here supports vaccines being being
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
safe you know I know that the question
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
of um uh well I think partly this comes
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
back to the the some of the Florida
 
01:17:59.630 --> 01:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
guidance that was out in the news
 
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
recently where they did a very high
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
level crude analysis of some of their
 
01:18:06.729 --> 01:18:06.739 align:start position:0%
their death data which I think
 
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
inappropriately suggested
 
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
um that there was a higher rate of death
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
after vaccination
 
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
um and again this is this is where it's
 
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
important to sort of look at the study
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
and look at the science behind it
 
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
because that that report is not the kind
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
of data that would I think ever get
 
01:18:33.169 --> 01:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
published or make its way into a
 
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
scientific journal just because of all
 
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
the problems behind that analysis when
 
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
it comes to
 
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to questions of
 
01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines and safety
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
um what what I will say and what we have
 
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
said all along is that there there are
 
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
not there's not evidence of some excess
 
01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:56.699 align:start position:0%
number of deaths related to vaccines
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
that that I that I've seen now there are
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
people suggesting that but I don't think
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
that that's backed by science or data
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
and in fact any death that occurs after
 
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
vaccination for whatever the cause is
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
required to be reported into theirs
 
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
which then gets investigated further
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
um and so it's it's not just about doing
 
01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
you know high level you know medical
 
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
record system analysis uh it's it's
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
really about diving in to understand the
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
cause of death
 
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
um and what's what's been found in
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
reviewing that data is that you know
 
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
people that are reportedly dying after
 
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
vaccination are not dying from you know
 
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
the vaccine themselves a vast majority
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
of them are getting vaccinated and then
 
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
dying from other causes or even covid-19
 
01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
itself so a lot of those a lot of the uh
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
wrong information that's out there about
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
all these deaths from vaccine or not not
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
actually deaths from vaccines themselves
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's data that is
 
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
um that is poor quality data or data
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's being misrepresented or
 
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted to back someone's opinion
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
or concern
 
01:20:12.130 --> 01:20:12.140 align:start position:0%
yeah how will we how are we supposed to
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh believe in scientific data and I'll
 
01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
use your point because it was uh right
 
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
on where particularly uh we saw
 
01:20:22.729 --> 01:20:22.739 align:start position:0%
individuals in nursing homes that had
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
comorbidities uh
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
that came down with covet there their
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
death certificate revealed that the
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
death was coveted not the other so you
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
know the we I think there's a certain
 
01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
number of people who believe that those
 
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
numbers were skewed to make it seem like
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh covered was worse than it was uh
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
versus uh having the comorbidity so you
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
know how are we as legislators supposed
 
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.729 align:start position:0%
know how are we as legislators supposed
to

01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
understand and believe what is actually
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
the truth yeah another another great
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
question I think your your concern gets
 
01:20:59.450 --> 01:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
that the question of how we conduct how
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
we conduct death surveillance
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
particularly around coven 19.
 
01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
um and that this is I think another area
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
of confusion because different states
 
01:21:08.209 --> 01:21:08.219 align:start position:0%
have done it different ways all
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic and you've heard
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
reports coming out from other states you
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
know I I will say that um in New
 
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can speak for New Hampshire
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
um we rely on the death certificate
 
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
um the the death certificate is a formal
 
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
objective way of assessing deaths from
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
any disease it also relies on the health
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
care provider who's pronouncing the
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
person as having died a health care
 
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
provider assessment as to the cause of
 
01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:38.030 align:start position:0%
provider assessment as to the cause of
death

01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
death
 
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and so we're not the the public
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
health agency the New Hampshire uh
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
is not the agency that's you know
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
vetting and assessing whether somebody
 
01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
died or not from disease a or disease X
 
01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
or covid-19 we're relying on that
 
01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider assessment to help
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
make that determination and not only
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
that assessment but that assessment as
 
01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
documented in the death record and so if
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
anything at least in New Hampshire our
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
our assessment of covid-19 related
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
deaths is likely an under assessment now
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
other states have done it different ways
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
which has been in the media over the
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
course of the pandemic with people
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
voicing concerns about overestimating
 
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
covid-19 related deaths but that's not
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
the case in New Hampshire we've always
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
taken a much more conservative approach
 
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
to classifying covid-19 related deaths
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's very similar to how we track other
 
01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
um other deaths from other diseases like
 
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
influenza and so again I think we've
 
01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
we've tried to come up with a process
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
that is relies on the existing systems
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
we have in place similar to how we track
 
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
other you know infectious disease
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
related deaths and relies ultimately on
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
that health care provider assessment as
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
to the cause of death
 
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
command of a chair
 
01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you my questions
 
01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
are about the Telehealth part of this
 
01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.950 align:start position:0%
are about the Telehealth part of this
item

01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
item
 
01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:58.790 align:start position:0%
item
um

01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
the process of how this works so if I do
 
01:23:08.169 --> 01:23:08.179 align:start position:0%
a home test
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
and it's positive am I able to then
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
access this Telehealth program
 
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
and it's my insurance going to cover the
 
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
cost of the Pax clavid sure if I'm
 
01:23:27.010 --> 01:23:27.020 align:start position:0%
eligible or is the money where
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
appropriating today going to pay for
 
01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
that and my insurance company won't be
 
01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
billed or do I have to go somewhere and
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
get a PCR test
 
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much for that
 
01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
question Senator Rosenwald so we are
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
envisioning this program similar to a
 
01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
program that was done in Massachusetts
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
so again I'm home I'm sick I have a
 
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
rapid antigen test I test positive I may
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
be at risk for poor outcomes so you can
 
01:23:54.890 --> 01:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
call the tell this entity we will put a
 
01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
contract through that will go through
 
01:23:58.250 --> 01:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
governor and Council for a health care
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
entity who will be available 24 maybe
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
not 24 7 but certainly seven days a week
 
01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
to be able to take you in and do a
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
medical evaluation and look at your your
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
tests that you tested positive they may
 
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
ask you to take another test but I think
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
they will document you know you show up
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
yep I tested positive and they'll go
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
through and ask several questions and
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
assess whether or not pacslovid or
 
01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
another therapeutic is right for you
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
um assuming it is they will have two
 
01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
options one they could send that
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
directly into your Pharmacy so if I go
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
to my Colonial Pharmacy in New London
 
01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they can send that script
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
in and I can have someone go and pick it
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
up for me if that won't work for me
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
because I'm homebound or I don't have
 
01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:41.219 align:start position:0%
anyone to go out to the pharmacy for me
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
we can arrange for it to be overnight
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
shipped directly to your home the
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
question around insurance is an
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
interesting one because the at the
 
01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
um currently pacslovit is covered it is
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
by the federal government so it is free
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
at this moment that may change in the
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
future and we want to build in
 
01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
flexibility within the contract to
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
ensure that we can cover that for an
 
01:25:06.050 --> 01:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
uninsured person we want to make sure
 
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
that these the Telehealth visits are
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
available to anyone appropriate 18 and
 
01:25:10.679 --> 01:25:11.810 align:start position:0%
available to anyone appropriate 18 and
over

01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
um and have it to be free and no cost to
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
them is there anything you'd like to add
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
Dr Ballard
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
no that's very accurate and so Jonathan
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
Ballard chief medical officer for the
 
01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.090 align:start position:0%
Ballard chief medical officer for the
Department

01:25:23.090 --> 01:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
Department
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
um So currently the peck slope it is
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
being directly provided to pharmacies
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
from the federal government and so when
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
you get it uh you they Pharmacy May
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
charge a dispensing fee potentially
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to but there's no charge
 
01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
for the drug itself
 
01:25:41.689 --> 01:25:41.699 align:start position:0%
also the federal government has provided
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
Services in New Hampshire a supply of
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
pacslova that we will provide to the
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
contracted vendor for the medication
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
that would be directly shipped or
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.679 --> 01:25:58.490 align:start position:0%
 
um so

01:25:58.490 --> 01:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:01.400 align:start position:0%
this sounds like it's a money saver
 
01:26:05.209 --> 01:26:05.219 align:start position:0%
because if I do a home test I don't have
 
01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
to go to one of those for profit urgent
 
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
care centers that are going to do a
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
whole work up and charge me
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
a big co-pay and a co-insurance to make
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
sure I don't have anything else going on
 
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
right absolutely no charge for using
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
that Telehealth no charge for using the
 
01:26:25.729 --> 01:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
Telehealth and I think that that's one
 
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
of the benefits of this program again as
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
we get through this winter surge I have
 
01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
shared my personal story I had covid
 
01:26:35.209 --> 01:26:35.219 align:start position:0%
recently and when I called my primary
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
care physician they said go to the
 
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
emergency room I was actually feeling so
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
poorly I did not want to go to the
 
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
emergency room and again
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
Urgent Care said come on in I didn't
 
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:47.219 align:start position:0%
feel like that was the right path for me
 
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
I waited until I could go to a pharmacy
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
that also has a federal program called
 
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
test to treat but really not many people
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
know about that and it's really
 
01:26:56.689 --> 01:26:56.699 align:start position:0%
complicated so we want to make this
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
easier for people especially in rural
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
areas especially people who may not have
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
a strong relationship with a primary
 
01:27:04.729 --> 01:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
care provider who tests positive on a
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
Saturday morning and don't want to wait
 
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
several days and and finally I mean I
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
think this sounds like one of the best
 
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
ideas I've heard in a long time thank
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
you for doing it
 
01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:15.729 align:start position:0%
you for doing it
um

01:27:15.729 --> 01:27:15.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
when will this program be up and running
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
and how how are the 1.4 million people
 
01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire supposed to know about
 
01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:25.729 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire supposed to know about
it

01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
a couple of components to that
 
01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
so we will identify we're in procurement
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
process with a potential vendor it will
 
01:27:34.689 --> 01:27:34.699 align:start position:0%
go to governor and Council very soon
 
01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
whenever it is ex performed with
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
government Council we fully expect that
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
this type of a program with a potential
 
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
vendor would be implemented very fast
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
now some programs like Staffing surges
 
01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
and those take time to pull to implement
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
but this is not something that will take
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of time to implement
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
it would be within weeks or days of the
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
governor and council meeting and if I
 
01:27:58.850 --> 01:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
just may add
 
01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:01.810 align:start position:0%
uh the
the

01:28:01.810 --> 01:28:01.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
Investments that this committee has made
 
01:28:05.689 --> 01:28:05.699 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of years these very
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
targeted projects like this I think is
 
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
what distinguished New Hampshire as well
 
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
and so much so much of our good response
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
um there was Senator Daniels has asked
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the past for us to bring data back
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
when we bring programs forth like this
 
01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
to say you know to justify what we've
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
done in the past and these types of
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
programs uh there was a recent report
 
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
from the Commonwealth Fund in June of
 
01:28:32.209 --> 01:28:32.219 align:start position:0%
2022 that looked at throughout 2021 and
 
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
20 up until March of 2022 all the states
 
01:28:38.450 --> 01:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
and the amount of excess deaths that
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
each state encountered from all causes
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
including covid and there was only one
 
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
state that had less excess deaths than
 
01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:47.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and it was Hawaii but we
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
had the second least excess deaths from
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
covid from opioid overdoses from chronic
 
01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
disease deaths compared to any other
 
01:28:58.129 --> 01:28:58.139 align:start position:0%
state and I brought that along with you
 
01:28:59.689 --> 01:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
just so you know that these types of
 
01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
Target Investments that we've done one
 
01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
not positive but suggestive have made a
 
01:29:07.199 --> 01:29:08.510 align:start position:0%
not positive but suggestive have made a
difference

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
and to follow up the last part of how
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
will people know it is built into the
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
contract that they will have to do some
 
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
advertising and maximize that the vendor
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
itself will do advertising and we'll
 
01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
certainly amplify that through the
 
01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
department with through our
 
01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my question is
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
more of curiosity rather than this
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
specific discussion about the vaccine I
 
01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
was an early adopter
 
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
and got covered in 2020
 
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
took me out of the commission for about
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
three weeks and thankfully I lost 20
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
pounds which I've gained back but that's
 
01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
a different story the problem I've had
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
the the issue I've had is there's been
 
01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
no recognition of actually Contracting
 
01:29:59.090 --> 01:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
the disease and your
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh protection you know it's it's like
 
01:30:04.129 --> 01:30:04.139 align:start position:0%
devoid of any value that you actually
 
01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
had covet and I'm just curious why why
 
01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
isn't there anything that says below if
 
01:30:11.330 --> 01:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
you've already had it maybe you only
 
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
need one booster instead of two or some
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
anything just some kind of recognition
 
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative Emrick so
 
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
that actually is something we do have in
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
our guidance and there's a time period
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
after having contracted kova 19 that we
 
01:30:26.930 --> 01:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
actually say and Dr Chan referenced this
 
01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
earlier that we would recommend delay
 
01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
getting the booster vaccine until a time
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
period passed by Dr chance at 90 days 90
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
days 90 days and so after that time
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
period we'd actually do do recommend
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
that to wait that time period and then

okay we now turn to oh by the way Dr
 
01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
Chan thank you so much for your your
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
presentation and I believe that it has
 
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
uh provided a lot of really good
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
information to the committee as well as
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
to um anyone that might be watching it
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
on YouTube so thank you so much for that
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
authorization to expend 228
 
01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:34.090 align:start position:0%
authorization to expend 228
000

01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:34.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.649 --> 01:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you madam
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
chair hopefully this is more in the
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
lines of yes or no
 
01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
um we're this looks like it's a request
 
01:32:59.570 --> 01:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
to buy a particular form of a test and
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
it's specifically written up for covid
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious if
 
01:33:09.010 --> 01:33:09.020 align:start position:0%
um there are tests that would fall under
 
01:33:12.169 --> 01:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
this sort of funding Authority that
 
01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
would be more robust in its testing I
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
mean people used to die of flu are we
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
gonna are we going to use this or is
 
01:33:21.649 --> 01:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
there anything we can buy that will test
 
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
for more than one thing
 
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards for
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
that question so as the pandemic has
 
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
progressed new technology new
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics has emerged allow us to
 
01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
mitigate the effects of it and this is
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
one development that we want to
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
implement for those persons that we
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
serve at our 24 7 facilities so a PCR
 
01:33:42.649 --> 01:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
test is a test that is a you know a gold
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
standard type of test that that
 
01:33:45.239 --> 01:33:45.890 align:start position:0%
standard type of test that that
um

01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
is for both symptomatic and asymptomatic
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
persons now we have those tests that are
 
01:33:54.169 --> 01:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
rapid on site that can be done at the at
 
01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
the actual facility not having to be
 
01:33:59.810 --> 01:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
sent off to a lab also now the tests are
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
available to be done through saliva
 
01:34:04.729 --> 01:34:04.739 align:start position:0%
samples and not a nose nasal sample so
 
01:34:06.669 --> 01:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
this is sort of the latest
 
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh you know latest thing that is FDA you
 
01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
know emergency Authority authorized
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
approved and
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
what it can do for us is very unique
 
01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
situations I was speaking with the
 
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
commandant of the New Hampshire veterans
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
home for when our when one of our
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
veterans uh May contract covid-19 and
 
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
they have a roommate who's asymptomatic
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
this will be a particular test that that
 
01:34:34.729 --> 01:34:34.739 align:start position:0%
roommate can have that will be highly
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
accurate immediately allow her to make
 
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
the commandant to make those decisions
 
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
or whether or not that we need to to
 
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
move the patient to another room
 
01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
and so uh there is no other flu vaccine
 
01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
or anything or excuse me flu test that
 
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
is like this yet all of those tests have
 
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
to be done in a commercial laboratory so
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
this is sort of the latest technology
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
that's available but is not able to be
 
01:34:59.330 --> 01:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
combined with other types of tests such
 
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
as testing for flu
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay that last sentence was what I was
 
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
looking for thank you
 
01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.070 align:start position:0%
looking for thank you
okay

01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
Senator Daniels thank you over the over
 
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
the past few months or years we've spent
 
01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of money putting it into testing
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
stuff what do we have for current
 
01:35:19.129 --> 01:35:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
zero for this type of Technology uh this
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
is a this is a new type of technology
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
that allows us to make better decisions
 
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
for our veterans and other persons that
 
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
um uh it will benefit so we don't have
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
any any we have rapid antigen tests but
 
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
those take some time to to develop uh
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
positive results or negative results
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
after exposure to the virus so this will
 
01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
be uh allow us to make decisions sooner
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
and we have zero supply of this okay
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:53.940 align:start position:0%

if no one else does I'll just ask my
questions

01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.590 align:start position:0%
questions
um

01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
when do we anticipate Medicaid
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
the great question so just yesterday
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
the secretary of the U.S Department of
 
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services just uh
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
renewed The Declaration of the federal
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency for another 90
 
01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
days so we are anticipating that it
 
01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:35.219 align:start position:0%
could certainly end January 12th would
 
01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
be that particular date we expect that
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
we would get notification of that from
 
01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
the White House 60 days in advance of
 
01:38:45.770 --> 01:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
that date so we're looking at hopefully
 
01:38:47.689 --> 01:38:47.699 align:start position:0%
knowing more information by November
 
01:38:47.699 --> 01:38:49.490 align:start position:0%
knowing more information by November
12th

01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
12th
 
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:50.270 align:start position:0%
12th
um

01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:53.629 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.250 --> 01:38:57.260 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment if it were to end
 
01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh January 11th The Continuous
 
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
February 1st would be the first date
 
01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
that coverage could be terminated
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
and then the enhanced fmap of 6.2
 
01:39:23.709 --> 01:39:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
so if I understand what you just said we
 
01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
have no clue
 
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.990 align:start position:0%
that's correct
okay

01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
well I just thought I'd ask and uh
 
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
and how many people are currently
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:54.910 --> 01:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
so that currently there's uh 243
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
238 individuals who need my glasses who
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
are enrolled in Medicaid and that's
 
01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.290 align:start position:0%
are enrolled in Medicaid and that's
individuals

01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
the protected status the protected
 
01:40:09.490 --> 01:40:09.500 align:start position:0%
number of individuals
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
and those are the individuals who are at
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.850 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
that's all does anyone else have any
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
question representative Edwards
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair so
 
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
um this is actually a good example of
 
01:40:41.090 --> 01:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
the conversation I I was having earlier
 
01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
with Miss or Caswell
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh that we're we're looking to use
 
01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
technology to
 
01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:50.629 align:start position:0%
technology to
um

01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
make us more efficient and do with fewer
 
01:40:58.250 --> 01:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
Manpower less Manpower so do we have the
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
skill sets to to go in and make sure
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
that we're not just substituting
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
technology that we're actually looking
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
at a redesign of workflow to leverage
 
01:41:10.729 --> 01:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
the technical capacities or in other
 
01:41:14.090 --> 01:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
words are are are we are we really going
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of the opportunity to
 
01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
fundamentally improve the system
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
and by that I mean more than the I.T
 
01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.590 align:start position:0%
and by that I mean more than the I.T
system

01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:41:26.209 --> 01:41:26.219 align:start position:0%
certainly that's a good question
 
01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um so in
 
01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
preparing for this item
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
the department in conjunction with the
 
01:41:36.169 --> 01:41:36.179 align:start position:0%
incumbent vendor looked at the solution
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at for New Heights
 
01:41:43.129 --> 01:41:43.139 align:start position:0%
and the goal is to use that funds to do
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
that business process management or
 
01:41:48.169 --> 01:41:48.179 align:start position:0%
re-engineering to allow for the manual
 
01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
processes to be replaced with the
 
01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
automation this will allow those people
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
that would be otherwise impacted
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
pretty heavily by 95 000 people
 
01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
potentially being losing their
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility to focus on providing the
 
01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:05.420 align:start position:0%
services and providing the
 
01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
continuous operations of the system if
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
we don't implement this solution the
 
01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
staff would be overwhelmed with
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
potential eligibility Appeals so this is
 
01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:18.169 align:start position:0%
potential eligibility Appeals so this is
really

01:42:18.169 --> 01:42:18.179 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
to answer your question is part of that
 
01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
business Process Management we
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
identified this is the only way we can
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
really address the potential Public
 
01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:32.450 align:start position:0%
 
effectively

01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question I I think
 
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
you brushed up against it
 
01:42:40.370 --> 01:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I'm more concerned at this
 
01:42:43.609 --> 01:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
point in the quality of the business
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
process re-engineering and whether or
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
not we have access to the skill sets if
 
01:42:51.169 --> 01:42:51.179 align:start position:0%
if we think we're going to actually do a
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
redesign of the workflow and then
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
support that new workflow with the
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
technology or if we're just more going
 
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
to try to substitute technology for
 
01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.689 align:start position:0%
to try to substitute technology for
people

01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the clarification so we
 
01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.390 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the clarification so we
are

01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
looking at simplifying that workflow
 
01:43:14.209 --> 01:43:14.219 align:start position:0%
with the use of this technology so
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
they're really the additional skill sets
 
01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:17.990 align:start position:0%
they're really the additional skill sets
that

01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
um really isn't necessary we really have
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
the skill sets already so the
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
enhancements would automate some of the
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
process it would also assist staff to
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
manage it much more simplified currently
 
01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
it's entirely manual
 
01:43:40.250 --> 01:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
so when requests are received for an
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
appeal there is a great deal of manual
 
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
pulling of information and putting
 
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
together notifications for the
 
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
administrative Appeals Unit making sure
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
all that is done in a timely manner so
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
this is to basically increase the
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
capacity of staff and reduce that
 
01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:58.570 align:start position:0%
capacity of staff and reduce that
workload

01:43:58.570 --> 01:43:58.580 align:start position:0%
workload
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
with each of the types of tracking
 
01:44:02.689 --> 01:44:02.699 align:start position:0%
methods that we're looking at
 
01:44:02.699 --> 01:44:06.430 align:start position:0%
methods that we're looking at
implementing

01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
I do have one further question of the um
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
ninety three thousand or ninety six
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
thousand folks are talking about uh
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
versus adults
 
01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
currently the number of children or this
 
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
is as of uh uh earlier in the month uh
 
01:44:35.209 --> 01:44:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
yeah two-thirds okay
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay could I have a motion to accept
 
01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
on FIS 22363.
 
01:44:58.609 --> 01:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald second
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
oh the clerk please call the roll
 
01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
call on 363. representative Edwards
 
01:45:12.050 --> 01:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
no on 363
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
everybody's yes representative Earth yes
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
Riverson leischman yes Senator Daniels
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
yes Senator Bradley yes Senator gray yes
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%

representative umbreger yes
 
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure the boat is nine to one the
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:44.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:56.090 --> 01:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
there were someone had some questions on
 
01:45:59.040 --> 01:45:59.810 align:start position:0%
there were someone had some questions on
this

01:45:59.810 --> 01:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
yes Santa Rosa Mall thank you
 
01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.510 align:start position:0%
yes Santa Rosa Mall thank you
um

01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
we had asked the department to respond
 
01:46:10.729 --> 01:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
and I think you have but I wanted it to
 
01:46:14.689 --> 01:46:14.699 align:start position:0%
be said publicly there is not a claw
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
back if somebody
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
loses Medicaid eligibility
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
after the end of the public health
 
01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:25.370 align:start position:0%
after the end of the public health
emergency

01:46:25.370 --> 01:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
um but there have been claims submitted
 
01:46:31.609 --> 01:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
they would not be responsible for
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
repayment to the state or the federal
 
01:46:34.199 --> 01:46:38.030 align:start position:0%
repayment to the state or the federal
government

01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
after the record Henry Littman the
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director for the State uh thank
 
01:46:43.370 --> 01:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
you for the question Senator
 
01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
um we are protected
 
01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
um as long as we made the eligibility
 
01:46:50.450 --> 01:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
determination correctly and we have a
 
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:03.410 --> 01:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
did you
 
01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
could you repeat that it didn't sound
 
01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:47:18.590 --> 01:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
what I was explaining that is if
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
um incur costs for someone uh during the
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
continuous eligibility period we're
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
protected against a clawback
 
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
as long as we made the original
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
determination of Eligibility correctly
 
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
okay that thank you I guess my ears
 
01:47:43.310 --> 01:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
weren't listening well I probably need
 
01:47:46.129 --> 01:47:46.139 align:start position:0%
to speak up no that that's fine that's
 
01:47:49.689 --> 01:47:49.699 align:start position:0%
fine are there any other questions
 
01:47:52.189 --> 01:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
representative yes you know what I I
 
01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
think you may not have completely
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
answered Senator rosenwald's question I
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
think she was also asking about
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries in other words if a
 
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
beneficiary is there any provision for a
 
01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:02.030 align:start position:0%
beneficiary is there any provision for a
clawback

01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
clawback
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
that the beneficiary who improperly and
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying fraudulently or anything
 
01:48:08.090 --> 01:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
like that but if they apply for benefits
 
01:48:09.770 --> 01:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
they were awarded and then it's
 
01:48:11.689 --> 01:48:11.699 align:start position:0%
determined that they shouldn't have that
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
for some reason they shouldn't have got
 
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
received them is there a club act
 
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
provision that they have to pay back
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding on that would be no
 
01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%

are there questions Senator Rosenwald
 
01:51:55.010 --> 01:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning it's
 
01:51:56.570 --> 01:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
still morning
 
01:51:56.580 --> 01:51:57.410 align:start position:0%
still morning
um

01:51:57.410 --> 01:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
it's like an eye test reading this chart
 
01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:02.390 align:start position:0%
it's like an eye test reading this chart
but

01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:52:05.570 --> 01:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
um I did notice that most of the fees
 
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
are staying the same however you've
 
01:52:12.290 --> 01:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
raised through fees in three groups
 
01:52:16.090 --> 01:52:16.100 align:start position:0%
versus the previous winter one is
 
01:52:20.030 --> 01:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
seniors where the fees go up by about a
 
01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:20.870 align:start position:0%
seniors where the fees go up by about a
third

01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
third
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
from last year or to this year and then
 
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
we have New Hampshire residents going up
 
01:52:31.070 --> 01:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
10 percent and state employees going up
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
10 percent so given this is a state
 
01:52:37.729 --> 01:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
resource I'm wondering
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
how you've decided
 
01:52:44.330 --> 01:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
to put the fee increases on New
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents our state employees
 
01:52:49.370 --> 01:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
that are hard enough to retain and
 
01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:51.530 align:start position:0%
that are hard enough to retain and
seniors

01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
seniors
 
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question for the
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
record my name is John devivo general
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
manager at Franconia Notch State Park
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
and Canada Mountain ski area so
 
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
in every year we do Market studies we
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
try to test and see where the ceilings
 
01:53:07.729 --> 01:53:07.739 align:start position:0%
are and and what the market will bear in
 
01:53:09.169 --> 01:53:09.179 align:start position:0%
addition to taking a look at what we've
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
been charging for several years in any
 
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
specific category and in those specific
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
areas we've we actually felt like we had
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
room to do minimal increases
 
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
that the percentages may appear to be
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
higher but the dollar figures are not
 
01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.209 --> 01:53:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
you're balancing what the market will
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
bear versus
 
01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
how we could deploy this state resource
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
to benefit the people of the state yeah
 
01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
whenever possible we try to defer to
 
01:53:49.729 --> 01:53:49.739 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:53:53.570 --> 01:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
status and protect those specific price
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
areas for New Hampshire residents for
 
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
example we're happy to do our New
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident Wednesday we've
 
01:54:01.129 --> 01:54:01.139 align:start position:0%
brought that back we're happy to do all
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
of our New Hampshire resident
 
01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
discounting which we enjoy doing but is
 
01:54:09.169 --> 01:54:09.179 align:start position:0%
also part of an RSA in specific areas we
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
will look and see where there is room so
 
01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
that we can remain viable and make some
 
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:22.010 --> 01:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
Senator Daniels thank you
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
this last project we we added
 
01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
significantly more to tourism to try to
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
I feel that by raising the fees on them
 
01:54:36.530 --> 01:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we're now fighting
 
01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
against tourism you know getting up here
 
01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
but we'll charge you more so convince me
 
01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:46.490 align:start position:0%
but we'll charge you more so convince me
differently

01:54:46.490 --> 01:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
well sir we do have specific costs that
 
01:54:51.169 --> 01:54:51.179 align:start position:0%
we need to cover we do uh we do have a
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
requirement that we are
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
essentially at market value we do our
 
01:54:57.770 --> 01:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
very best to be more of a value than our
 
01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
five major competitors and it really uh
 
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
any competitors and we feel like we are
 
01:55:04.490 --> 01:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
the very best at hitting value for price
 
01:55:07.070 --> 01:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
paid in all those categories but like
 
01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
with all other aspects of life our costs
 
01:55:10.189 --> 01:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
have increased
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
and we do have a fiduciary
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility to remain viable as a
 
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
state agency
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:55:25.090 --> 01:55:25.100 align:start position:0%
I do have a couple
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
and this deals with the uh ten dollars
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
I know we implemented a bus program and
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
the object was to get people to take the
 
01:55:44.330 --> 01:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
bus and I
 
01:55:46.609 --> 01:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
if I remember the parking fee was five
 
01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:48.659 align:start position:0%
dollars is that correct
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
well I actually I'm sorry actually uh
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
the fee based shuttle system is for
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
ridership rather than parking
 
01:55:59.450 --> 01:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
no right and so most people at this
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
point are dropping off at those Trail
 
01:56:04.729 --> 01:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
heads uh and sending the driver North in
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
order to spend less money frankly
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay so the buses you pay to ride the
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
bus yes okay
 
01:56:18.290 --> 01:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
and how many parking spaces do you have
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
within the notch we're approaching 2000
 
01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
in total
 
01:56:23.689 --> 01:56:23.699 align:start position:0%
the the item that we've put before you
 
01:56:27.590 --> 01:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
would be the ability to charge for 202
 
01:56:29.570 --> 01:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
spaces right at the two very primary
 
01:56:32.090 --> 01:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
Trail heads uh one is the epicenter for
 
01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
Franconia Ridge the other is the
 
01:56:35.689 --> 01:56:35.699 align:start position:0%
epicenter for kinsman Ridge over on the
 
01:56:37.609 --> 01:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
cannon side
 
01:56:39.290 --> 01:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
all of the parking spaces are free
 
01:56:41.450 --> 01:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
within the Notch and it's it's really
 
01:56:43.129 --> 01:56:43.139 align:start position:0%
dependent upon which venue or which
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
Trailhead you would want to uh to go and
 
01:56:45.239 --> 01:56:46.189 align:start position:0%
Trailhead you would want to uh to go and
hike

01:56:46.189 --> 01:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
hike
 
01:56:49.129 --> 01:56:49.139 align:start position:0%
but that influx of potentially eighty
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars would go a long way
 
01:56:53.209 --> 01:56:53.219 align:start position:0%
toward having a direct impact upon our
 
01:56:55.129 --> 01:56:55.139 align:start position:0%
ability to continue to run the hiker
 
01:56:56.689 --> 01:56:56.699 align:start position:0%
shuttle which costs approximately ninety
 
01:56:56.699 --> 01:56:57.590 align:start position:0%
shuttle which costs approximately ninety
thousand

01:56:57.590 --> 01:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:56:59.330 --> 01:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
between fuel
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
rentals of the vehicles themselves and
 
01:57:01.679 --> 01:57:04.669 align:start position:0%
rentals of the vehicles themselves and
wages

01:57:04.669 --> 01:57:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
if I if I could add the shuttle system
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
was implemented as a pilot program a
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
couple years ago we worked really
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
closely with DOT safety local
 
01:57:16.850 --> 01:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
authorities to try to solve the problem
 
01:57:19.010 --> 01:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
of 700 vehicles on a beautiful Saturday
 
01:57:21.709 --> 01:57:21.719 align:start position:0%
parked along the highway with dogs
 
01:57:24.169 --> 01:57:24.179 align:start position:0%
getting out and kids running around that
 
01:57:27.530 --> 01:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
was really scary for all of us so we we
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
agreed as the park operations
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
to put together this shuttle system and
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
it worked really well it's worked really
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
well and Dot continues to support this
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
with their signage and their barriers
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
along the way so we just want to make
 
01:57:46.609 --> 01:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
sure it's a sustainable operation and
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
we're looking for ways to cover the
 
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
expenses and we feel like these 200 plus
 
01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:54.659 align:start position:0%
parking spots are really the Primo spots
 
01:57:57.649 --> 01:57:57.659 align:start position:0%
that people would be willing to pay ten
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
dollars for and in contrast or to show
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
to show that this isn't a novel idea in
 
01:58:06.890 --> 01:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
our Park system if you want to hike at
 
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
Mount Monadnock you pay 15 to park at
 
01:58:12.410 --> 01:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
Mount Monadnock so it's it's a
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
similar situation there we we you cannot
 
01:58:17.290 --> 01:58:17.300 align:start position:0%
hike Mount Monadnock without paying 15
 
01:58:19.070 --> 01:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
to park
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
so it's it's an accepted fee
 
01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:29.870 --> 01:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none could I have a motion on FIS
 
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:37.880 align:start position:0%

a pilot program for individuals with
 
02:00:24.719 --> 02:00:26.229 align:start position:0%
a pilot program for individuals with

thank you very much
um

02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:58.010 --> 02:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards you have yes
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
ma'am I think I have two questions
 
02:01:00.719 --> 02:01:01.930 align:start position:0%
ma'am I think I have two questions
um

02:01:01.930 --> 02:01:01.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:03.530 align:start position:0%
um
one

02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
um if we approve this will the
 
02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
department consider this the fiscal
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
committee approval of your of your plan
 
02:01:15.649 --> 02:01:15.659 align:start position:0%
is this is this meant to be a plan or is
 
02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
this meant to be something other than
 
02:01:19.850 --> 02:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
the plan that we're supposed to approve
 
02:01:24.290 --> 02:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
before you go forward sure so HP 1661
 
02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
from this past legislative session it
 
02:01:27.890 --> 02:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
required that the department come
 
02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:29.390 align:start position:0%
required that the department come
forward

02:01:29.390 --> 02:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
um once the unnecessary coordination for
 
02:01:33.410 --> 02:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
the program had been sufficiently
 
02:01:36.410 --> 02:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
completed and we need to request from
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee that we may begin
 
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
implementation of the pilot program
 
02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
there there's a there's also a secondary
 
02:01:45.129 --> 02:01:45.139 align:start position:0%
requirement that on or before February 1
 
02:01:48.109 --> 02:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
2023 the department will provide a
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
detailed report of the pilot program
 
02:01:52.189 --> 02:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
plan that is is to come in the future
 
02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
but this specific action is to comply
 
02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
with the um the aforementioned provision
 
02:02:01.330 --> 02:02:01.340 align:start position:0%
from 1661 that I had mentioned
 
02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you um
 
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
to what extent have you already or will
 
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
you be coordinating this item after as
 
02:02:15.649 --> 02:02:15.659 align:start position:0%
presumably it's approved with the area
 
02:02:18.410 --> 02:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
agency so the area agencies already been
 
02:02:20.450 --> 02:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
in this Loop or not
 
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
um yes the area agencies have been in
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
this Loop they were part of the um whole
 
02:02:27.490 --> 02:02:27.500 align:start position:0%
process during the legislative process
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
and then we will be meeting with a group
 
02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
of Area Agency
 
02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:34.729 align:start position:0%
of Area Agency
um

02:02:34.729 --> 02:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
um designated people to really walk
 
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
through every time you know we work on a
 
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
child being found eligible and and all
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
of those instances so yes there's a lot
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
of Engagement
 
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
so so would you be surprised if I had
 
02:02:51.410 --> 02:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
heard from an area agency saying that
 
02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
they had not been included and what they
 
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
were hoping you'd say in answer to that
 
02:02:58.490 --> 02:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
question was not yet but they will be
 
02:03:01.370 --> 02:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
um not always surprised because when we
 
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
work with agencies lots of times we take
 
02:03:07.129 --> 02:03:07.139 align:start position:0%
Representatives that represent multiple
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
agencies or the entire system but
 
02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:11.890 align:start position:0%
agencies or the entire system but
anytime

02:03:11.890 --> 02:03:11.900 align:start position:0%
anytime
 
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
these children young adults would be
 
02:03:17.330 --> 02:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
coming through the area agency system so
 
02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
they would be involved prior to having
 
02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:25.310 align:start position:0%
they would be involved prior to having
funding

02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:33.119 --> 02:03:34.609 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:03:34.609 --> 02:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
first of all I don't believe this is a
 
02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:38.089 align:start position:0%
first of all I don't believe this is a
plan

02:03:38.089 --> 02:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:51.770 --> 02:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
um what the priority order is when
 
02:03:55.550 --> 02:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
will you bring back a plan I mean an
 
02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:57.719 align:start position:0%
actual plan that says
 
02:04:01.250 --> 02:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
you know here here's what we are
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
planning to do
 
02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:04.689 align:start position:0%
planning to do
under

02:04:04.689 --> 02:04:04.699 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
emergency room ABCD
 
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is I mean I don't
 
02:04:15.169 --> 02:04:15.179 align:start position:0%
I don't consider this to be a plan
 
02:04:18.669 --> 02:04:18.679 align:start position:0%
I consider this to be a high level of
 
02:04:21.890 --> 02:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
here's what we're looking to accomplish
 
02:04:28.250 --> 02:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:30.649 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:04:30.649 --> 02:04:30.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
this really is looking at filling a gap
 
02:04:40.370 --> 02:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
that exists and based on the legislation
 
02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
it is really targeting those children
 
02:04:47.570 --> 02:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
young adults who are have not exited the
 
02:04:49.609 --> 02:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
school system and are in need of
 
02:04:52.609 --> 02:04:52.619 align:start position:0%
residential services and so those are
 
02:04:55.870 --> 02:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
prioritized here and then throughout
 
02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
what happens is then you go through the
 
02:05:01.010 --> 02:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
individual planning process that you do
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
with any individual and family to
 
02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
determine what is the next step to serve
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
them the detailed report that we are to
 
02:05:11.089 --> 02:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
provide in February which is just a few
 
02:05:13.550 --> 02:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
months away will really get into the
 
02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
details as to who access the services
 
02:05:19.490 --> 02:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
what types of services they needed so we
 
02:05:21.290 --> 02:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
can really work on planning for the
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:31.490 --> 02:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
so you're telling me February
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
is when I'll get a more detailed plan
 
02:05:36.530 --> 02:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
you'll get a report in February this is
 
02:05:38.450 --> 02:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
the plan just to get us started to
 
02:05:41.330 --> 02:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
accept the funds so that we can begin to
 
02:05:44.030 --> 02:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
assist those individuals who fall in
 
02:05:46.850 --> 02:05:46.860 align:start position:0%
this Gap that exist in our state to
 
02:05:56.510 --> 02:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:56.520 --> 02:06:00.370 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:06:00.370 --> 02:06:00.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I want to share the chairs
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
concerns uh particularly in the area of
 
02:06:07.970 --> 02:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
funding you're talking about that's
 
02:06:10.129 --> 02:06:10.139 align:start position:0%
going to cost 140
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
000 per person but I would expect the
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
plan to break down where that 140 000 is
 
02:06:18.589 --> 02:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
expected to go so
 
02:06:21.050 --> 02:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
um you know I saw this I was actually
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
kind of looking through to find out
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
where's the plan this seemed more like
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
an outline to me so so I I just want to
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
call to attention
 
02:06:32.089 --> 02:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
um the the purpose of this item is to
 
02:06:34.490 --> 02:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
comply with with the aforementioned
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
provision of H being 1661 and excuse me
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
Nathan bring your mic closer oh
 
02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you there we go
 
02:06:47.689 --> 02:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
um what I wanted just to clarify is is
 
02:06:49.250 --> 02:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this item the section
 
02:06:52.669 --> 02:06:52.679 align:start position:0%
that we're citing is it it reads that if
 
02:06:54.770 --> 02:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
if the department determines that all
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
necessary coordination for the pilot
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
program has been sufficiently completed
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
we may make a request to the fiscal
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
Committee of the general court to begin
 
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
implementation of the program on an
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate effective date
 
02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
and and Chris uh Chris had cited um the
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
February 1 date and that's the date at
 
02:07:14.209 --> 02:07:14.219 align:start position:0%
which we would bring that report so this
 
02:07:16.189 --> 02:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
this isn't necessarily the comprehensive
 
02:07:18.410 --> 02:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
plan what you'll see in February is a
 
02:07:20.930 --> 02:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
lot more detail of that this is more a
 
02:07:23.089 --> 02:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
compliance request to comply with that
 
02:07:25.250 --> 02:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
specific provision of the state law that
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
was put into place and this is the
 
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
request for authorization to move
 
02:07:31.490 --> 02:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:35.149 --> 02:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question would be
 
02:07:37.129 --> 02:07:37.139 align:start position:0%
why would we
 
02:07:39.169 --> 02:07:39.179 align:start position:0%
why would we authorize you to spend
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
money to start a program that we may not
 
02:07:46.129 --> 02:07:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:49.250 --> 02:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
the legislature approved on this pilot
 
02:07:52.850 --> 02:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
as part of the last legislative session
 
02:07:56.050 --> 02:07:56.060 align:start position:0%
so according to um state law we are
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
required to do this pilot and this is
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
one of the steps that we have to take
 
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to ask Senator Bradley to
 
02:08:06.649 --> 02:08:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
okay I would I would also state that
 
02:08:12.830 --> 02:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
that the uh the bill that you just read
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
rev from also had the thing coming to
 
02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee which we look at
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
the monetary aspects of it too and right
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
now I just see a clump of money and I
 
02:08:25.550 --> 02:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
it's going to go to serve those those
 
02:08:30.589 --> 02:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
young adults that need the services and
 
02:08:33.050 --> 02:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
then the report that we do in February
 
02:08:35.450 --> 02:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
will give detailed information as
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
outlined in the legislation as to the
 
02:08:40.129 --> 02:08:40.139 align:start position:0%
types of services the number of young
 
02:08:48.189 --> 02:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
yes well
 
02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley please thank you very
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
so a little history
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
um the department brought forward a bill
 
02:09:06.169 --> 02:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
that I sponsored for the Department
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
two years ago that was wide open that
 
02:09:12.470 --> 02:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
anybody 18 to 21
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
um the potentially needed Services was
 
02:09:18.410 --> 02:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
going to be able to obtain services in
 
02:09:19.490 --> 02:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
this way
 
02:09:22.129 --> 02:09:22.139 align:start position:0%
the area agency subjected to that
 
02:09:25.010 --> 02:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
because of the some of the unknowns that
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
I think have been discussed here today
 
02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:31.070 align:start position:0%
I think have been discussed here today
and

02:09:31.070 --> 02:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:33.890 --> 02:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
as I recall we in the Senate stripped
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
that piece out of that bill I think it
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
was Senate Bill 160
 
02:09:43.550 --> 02:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.089 --> 02:09:47.099 align:start position:0%
when the department again came to me to
 
02:09:47.099 --> 02:09:48.649 align:start position:0%
when the department again came to me to
file

02:09:48.649 --> 02:09:48.659 align:start position:0%
file
 
02:09:52.129 --> 02:09:52.139 align:start position:0%
another Omnibus type bill
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
um that provision was in the bill again
 
02:09:59.930 --> 02:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
and I worked with the department and the
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
area agencies and came up with the
 
02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
number of up to 20 kids to try to answer
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
some of the questions as that have been
 
02:10:14.209 --> 02:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
raised by both the department and other
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
members here of the fiscal committee
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
today it would be my recommendation that
 
02:10:20.570 --> 02:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
we go forward with it
 
02:10:23.050 --> 02:10:23.060 align:start position:0%
um these are
 
02:10:25.490 --> 02:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
individuals that are potentially in need
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
of services
 
02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:28.189 align:start position:0%
of services
um

02:10:28.189 --> 02:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
we will learn a lot more from it and be
 
02:10:35.810 --> 02:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
able to I I would hope figure out what
 
02:10:38.209 --> 02:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
the demand could potentially be is it 20
 
02:10:40.609 --> 02:10:40.619 align:start position:0%
kids or is it a thousand kids we don't
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that I don't think
 
02:10:44.089 --> 02:10:44.099 align:start position:0%
you know the answer to that either right
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
and and but at the same time there are
 
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
families with disabled children that
 
02:10:52.970 --> 02:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
have left the school system that until
 
02:10:56.330 --> 02:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
they're 21 there's an obligation to
 
02:10:59.089 --> 02:10:59.099 align:start position:0%
serve so it seemed
 
02:11:01.629 --> 02:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
and both bodies passed it
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
although there was
 
02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:05.089 align:start position:0%
although there was
um

02:11:05.089 --> 02:11:05.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:07.609 --> 02:11:07.619 align:start position:0%
as you remember Madam chair we had to
 
02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
move this bill into the parking garage
 
02:11:14.209 --> 02:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
we parked it right there in 1661 but it
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
was never
 
02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
this piece was never really discussed as
 
02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
I recall in any kind of
 
02:11:22.020 --> 02:11:22.910 align:start position:0%
I recall in any kind of
um

02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:26.089 --> 02:11:26.099 align:start position:0%
controversial way in all of the Senate
 
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
hearings and I think all of the house
 
02:11:30.770 --> 02:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
hearings on the underlying bill that's
 
02:11:34.129 --> 02:11:34.139 align:start position:0%
my recollection of the process
 
02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
uh I will not argue at all that there's
 
02:11:40.910 --> 02:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
a problem in 18 to 21
 
02:11:43.250 --> 02:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
age group
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
okay I I have no problem with that uh
 
02:11:49.669 --> 02:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
because I I certainly recognize that
 
02:11:54.550 --> 02:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
that is a uh an area of
 
02:11:57.169 --> 02:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
underserved I think is maybe the right
 
02:12:00.050 --> 02:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
term that that I should use
 
02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:01.310 align:start position:0%
term that that I should use
but

02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:12:05.089 --> 02:12:05.099 align:start position:0%
your your pilot program as it stands
 
02:12:05.099 --> 02:12:06.129 align:start position:0%
your your pilot program as it stands
says

02:12:06.129 --> 02:12:06.139 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:12:08.689 --> 02:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
it's basically
 
02:12:11.570 --> 02:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:12:15.169 --> 02:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
your first first two items are homeless
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
for basically for homeless people
 
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
and your third item
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
is individuals already receiving the
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of services
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
through in-home support
 
02:12:30.239 --> 02:12:33.649 align:start position:0%
through in-home support
so

02:12:33.649 --> 02:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:33.659 --> 02:12:36.410 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:12:36.410 --> 02:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:39.530 --> 02:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
okay unless the legislation said that
 
02:12:41.930 --> 02:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
you were to focus on the homeless
 
02:12:46.669 --> 02:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
that you know I I question whether those
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
should be number one and number two well
 
02:12:51.709 --> 02:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
it's a young adult who meets the
 
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria under RSA 171a so
 
02:12:58.129 --> 02:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
they're already found eligible for
 
02:13:01.550 --> 02:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
developmental Services System and they
 
02:13:04.930 --> 02:13:04.940 align:start position:0%
do not have a place to live often times
 
02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
these young adults show up in the
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
emergency room and they can't go home
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
um and so when we say homeless that is
 
02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
determined as not individuals who would
 
02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
be homeless under the homeless Services
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
System these are individuals through the
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
area agency system who are eligible
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
under RSA 171a that threshold has to be
 
02:13:33.169 --> 02:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
met first and have no home to go to and
 
02:13:37.609 --> 02:13:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:40.189 --> 02:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
no but Madam chair if I may
 
02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:43.310 align:start position:0%
no but Madam chair if I may
um

02:13:43.310 --> 02:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
to go back to the uh what HHS is asking
 
02:13:49.069 --> 02:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
I think more specifically even though it
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
says to in the item itself it's um I
 
02:13:53.709 --> 02:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
should have taken a closer look at this
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
requestering review and approval of its
 
02:13:58.490 --> 02:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
plan the chapter are itself and I'm
 
02:14:01.069 --> 02:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
going to read it verbatim is that if the
 
02:14:03.169 --> 02:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
department determines that all necessary
 
02:14:06.109 --> 02:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
coordination for the pilot program has
 
02:14:08.569 --> 02:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
been sufficiently completed the
 
02:14:10.370 --> 02:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
department may make a request to the
 
02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal Committee of the general court to
 
02:14:14.270 --> 02:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
begin implementation of the pilot
 
02:14:16.490 --> 02:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
program on the appropriation effective
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
date uh and sent it in basically what
 
02:14:20.750 --> 02:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
happened Senator barely had mentioned
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
this is the legislature did appropriate
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
2.8 million dollars for these
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
individuals for a pilot program
 
02:14:27.770 --> 02:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a cap of about 20
 
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
individuals but before HHS can even
 
02:14:34.910 --> 02:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
spend dollar one uh they need fiscal to
 
02:14:37.490 --> 02:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
say yep are you sure you've done all the
 
02:14:40.250 --> 02:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
coordination for the pilot program and
 
02:14:42.410 --> 02:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
you're ready to go and then fiscal will
 
02:14:44.930 --> 02:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
say yes and you can be and suspended the
 
02:14:46.370 --> 02:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
paragraph before and it could be a
 
02:14:48.649 --> 02:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
little out of order in that
 
02:14:52.450 --> 02:14:52.460 align:start position:0%
um in that chapter law that's where the
 
02:14:55.609 --> 02:14:55.619 align:start position:0%
requirement that on February 1st 2023
 
02:14:58.430 --> 02:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
the department shall provide a detailed
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
report of the pilot program plan that's
 
02:15:03.229 --> 02:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
the first and only use of the word plan
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
to the Senate Health and Human Services
 
02:15:07.609 --> 02:15:07.619 align:start position:0%
committee Center Finance
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
house children and family law house HHS
 
02:15:13.310 --> 02:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
committee house finance as well as
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal not for approval but to provide
 
02:15:17.149 --> 02:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
that to them and then what that chapter
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
law does is specifically outline what
 
02:15:22.129 --> 02:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
the committee should expect to see
 
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
relative to what
 
02:15:28.010 --> 02:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
Christine was mentioning the data on
 
02:15:31.010 --> 02:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
utilization number of individuals Etc uh
 
02:15:32.750 --> 02:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
so I think maybe the wording of the
 
02:15:35.410 --> 02:15:35.420 align:start position:0%
request is causing some of the confusion
 
02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
what the department needs before they
 
02:15:42.050 --> 02:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
can even begin to spend that is the
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
approval of fiscal to begin the
 
02:15:46.850 --> 02:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
implementation of the pilot program the
 
02:15:48.649 --> 02:15:48.659 align:start position:0%
plan to be coming at a later date that
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
is not something that needs approval of
 
02:15:53.870 --> 02:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal if that helps to confuse or
 
02:15:56.209 --> 02:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
clarify the situation
 
02:15:59.930 --> 02:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
I think the comment that uh
 
02:16:02.569 --> 02:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
the explanation wasn't really very good
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's probably the most appropriate thing
 
02:16:08.689 --> 02:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
you said okay uh are there any further
 
02:16:08.699 --> 02:16:10.189 align:start position:0%
you said okay uh are there any further
questions

02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none could I have a motion to
 
02:16:12.239 --> 02:16:13.750 align:start position:0%
seeing none could I have a motion to
approve

02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
approve
 
02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:15.850 align:start position:0%

for staff who work overtime shifts at

for staff who work overtime shifts at

sysc
 
02:18:42.650 --> 02:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
we've gotten into a very very difficult
 
02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
Staffing situation in that building we
 
02:18:47.570 --> 02:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
are now down to we need about 45
 
02:18:49.849 --> 02:18:49.859 align:start position:0%
full-time youth counselors to run that
 
02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
building appropriately we're now down to
 
02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
20 full-time youth counselors to run
 
02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
that building
 
02:18:57.950 --> 02:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
we do have a handful of temporary staff
 
02:18:59.810 --> 02:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
which were approved at a prior fiscal
 
02:19:02.089 --> 02:19:02.099 align:start position:0%
committee here that contract is to be
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
able to have up to 18 at a time at this
 
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:11.530 --> 02:19:11.540 align:start position:0%
nine of those filled
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
it's been very very difficult to hire
 
02:19:16.730 --> 02:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain staff in addition
 
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
there has already been an enhancement
 
02:19:20.570 --> 02:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
approved by jnc on their salaries
 
02:19:22.730 --> 02:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
despite that it still has been
 
02:19:26.089 --> 02:19:26.099 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult to hire retain and
 
02:19:27.469 --> 02:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
recruit staff
 
02:19:28.969 --> 02:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
that's put us into a position where
 
02:19:30.410 --> 02:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
we're having to rely even more greatly
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
on overtime than in the past and staff
 
02:19:34.969 --> 02:19:34.979 align:start position:0%
are really struggling to keep up with
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
that over time
 
02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
the department has since put out a
 
02:19:40.250 --> 02:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
request for any Department staff who are
 
02:19:42.410 --> 02:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
qualified to be able to be trained in
 
02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
working as a YC there and to receive
 
02:19:46.009 --> 02:19:46.019 align:start position:0%
overtime compensation for working there
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
in order to have enough overtime hours
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
filled we believe is necessary to have
 
02:19:52.610 --> 02:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
an additional enhancement for folks to
 
02:19:53.929 --> 02:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
entice them to come in and work the
 
02:19:56.030 --> 02:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
overtime shifts so that's where this
 
02:19:58.910 --> 02:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
comes in the idea to try to entice more
 
02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
people to come into being voluntarily
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
working overtime shifts at sysc or to
 
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
provide additional compensation for
 
02:20:08.210 --> 02:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
folks who might be newly hired
 
02:20:10.490 --> 02:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
attracted by the opportunity to earn
 
02:20:12.349 --> 02:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
additional overtime while working in the
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
facility the plan sets forth that
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
anybody who works more than 24 hours of
 
02:20:18.889 --> 02:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
overtime in a pay period would be
 
02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
eligible for a 300 bonus in their
 
02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:22.790 align:start position:0%
eligible for a 300 bonus in their
paycheck

02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
paycheck
 
02:20:26.090 --> 02:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh are there any
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative Edwards uh
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Mr
 
02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:31.849 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Mr
ribson

02:20:31.849 --> 02:20:31.859 align:start position:0%
ribson
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
um so uh I the fundamental problem that
 
02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
you're trying to cope with as I
 
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
understand it is that we have uh on the
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
books in the rsas a closure date of 30
 
02:20:47.450 --> 02:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
March and there is no replacement plan
 
02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
in law at this point and that's the
 
02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
that's the 800 pound gorilla making it
 
02:20:57.170 --> 02:20:57.180 align:start position:0%
difficult to recruit and retain is is
 
02:20:59.630 --> 02:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
that correct that is a huge contributing
 
02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
factor I believe there are probably
 
02:21:03.170 --> 02:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
other contributing factors right such as
 
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
you know underlying salary which we've
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
tried to address such as the the general
 
02:21:08.929 --> 02:21:08.939 align:start position:0%
Cloud over the facility given the the
 
02:21:10.370 --> 02:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
horrible things that have happened in
 
02:21:13.610 --> 02:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
the past there but yes uh we saw
 
02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
actually once we were unable to have a
 
02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
resolution on that issue in the last
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
legislative session an additional third
 
02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
of our current working YC's had resigned
 
02:21:24.650 --> 02:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
because they had seen that
 
02:21:27.469 --> 02:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
you know there was not necessarily a
 
02:21:29.330 --> 02:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
future for them and it's incredibly
 
02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
difficult to operate a facility when you
 
02:21:33.889 --> 02:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
have that type of ambiguity over the
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
yes please okay so
 
02:21:42.889 --> 02:21:42.899 align:start position:0%
um so it seems like it may be necessary
 
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
but not sufficient
 
02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:46.610 align:start position:0%
but not sufficient
to

02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
extend the closure dates so that at
 
02:21:52.849 --> 02:21:52.859 align:start position:0%
least the retention problem is minimized
 
02:21:55.969 --> 02:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
I don't see how recruiting can really
 
02:21:58.969 --> 02:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
benefit until we have a replacement plan
 
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
until we know what the future looks like
 
02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
I I think we can keep people around but
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
recruiting them will be tough without a
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
replacement plan that's my theory what
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
do you think I believe that's true but
 
02:22:14.090 --> 02:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the entirety of it I do
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
think that you know if there is you know
 
02:22:18.410 --> 02:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
public signaling and support that this
 
02:22:20.090 --> 02:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
is going to be resolved that too will
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
help right I think a lot of this is that
 
02:22:23.929 --> 02:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
folks really aren't quite sure what's
 
02:22:26.450 --> 02:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
going to happen and you know even if it
 
02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
takes time for the legislature to come
 
02:22:29.330 --> 02:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
up with that replacement plan and to
 
02:22:30.469 --> 02:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
extend out the dates into the next
 
02:22:31.730 --> 02:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
session which I don't believe there's
 
02:22:33.230 --> 02:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
any alternative to that right I don't
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
believe there's a possibility to do
 
02:22:35.929 --> 02:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
anything sooner than the beginning of
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
the next session the fact that even this
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
conversation has started and there's
 
02:22:41.809 --> 02:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
been public reports about the extension
 
02:22:44.030 --> 02:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
of all of this has already helped us in
 
02:22:45.410 --> 02:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
these conversations with staff and
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
trying to say look there is a future
 
02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
sure people are working towards this but
 
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly important that progress
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
continued to be made so that people
 
02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
continue to see that they do have a
 
02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:59.050 align:start position:0%
continue to see that they do have a
future

02:22:59.050 --> 02:22:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:03.410 --> 02:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
excuse me may I yeah so I think I I
 
02:23:05.330 --> 02:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
think I've heard you described a
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
three-legged stool here that the issues
 
02:23:09.650 --> 02:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
that's causing your recruiting and
 
02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
retention problems you could summarize
 
02:23:16.510 --> 02:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
maybe in three legs one that we have a a
 
02:23:21.290 --> 02:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
closure date on record that
 
02:23:25.490 --> 02:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
um you have salary issues just to bring
 
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
people in and that you have sort of a a
 
02:23:32.090 --> 02:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
Goodwill messaging uh component of it
 
02:23:34.190 --> 02:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
that if if people in the department are
 
02:23:36.530 --> 02:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
hearing that the legislature and the
 
02:23:39.290 --> 02:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
public is interested in working on that
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
first problem which is the closure date
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
that that that those three things in
 
02:23:46.130 --> 02:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
combination could help address your
 
02:23:48.770 --> 02:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
concerns yes I believe that is there a
 
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
I think I I think that's I mean I think
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's accurate that's what's coming to
 
02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:57.290 align:start position:0%
that's accurate that's what's coming to
mind

02:23:57.290 --> 02:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:24:00.590 --> 02:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh I mean I don't think there's anyone
 
02:24:04.969 --> 02:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
in the legislature that believes that
 
02:24:08.090 --> 02:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
this new center is going to close on 31
 
02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:12.230 align:start position:0%
this new center is going to close on 31
March

02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know how I don't know
 
02:24:16.250 --> 02:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
how you reassure people that they'll
 
02:24:20.809 --> 02:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
have jobs on one April but um it's you
 
02:24:20.819 --> 02:24:22.010 align:start position:0%
have jobs on one April but um it's you
know

02:24:22.010 --> 02:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's not going to close it can't
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
so um I don't know if that helps or not
 
02:24:30.770 --> 02:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
but we'll do our level best to get
 
02:24:33.290 --> 02:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
legislation through quickly
 
02:24:37.010 --> 02:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh in uh in January
 
02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
that will hopefully help with um
 
02:24:44.090 --> 02:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
you know with people understanding that
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
there is a future
 
02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
although it may not you know 45 people
 
02:24:51.410 --> 02:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
is what you were talking you would
 
02:24:54.170 --> 02:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
probably require 45 for any new
 
02:24:56.030 --> 02:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
act uh
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
building or whatever so
 
02:25:02.750 --> 02:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
I know it's a problem and um but we'll
 
02:25:04.130 --> 02:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
get there
 
02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you all right are
 
02:25:09.410 --> 02:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
there any further questions uh Senator
 
02:25:09.420 --> 02:25:15.650 align:start position:0%
there any further questions uh Senator
Susie

02:25:15.650 --> 02:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
shoes but I wonder if you could just
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
update us I believe with respect to the
 
02:25:22.370 --> 02:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
salary issue collective bargaining
 
02:25:24.530 --> 02:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
negotiations play a huge part in this
 
02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:26.389 align:start position:0%
negotiations play a huge part in this
and

02:25:26.389 --> 02:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
the role the state has played vis-a-vis
 
02:25:30.830 --> 02:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
the employees I I think has also
 
02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
exacerbated your problem I wonder if you
 
02:25:35.450 --> 02:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
could speak to any specific issues that
 
02:25:37.849 --> 02:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
might be addressed soon in that
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement yeah so the the
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
immediate the immediate or short-term
 
02:25:44.330 --> 02:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
attempt to try to address that was
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
through a salary enhancements which were
 
02:25:49.010 --> 02:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
approved by GNC a little bit less than a
 
02:25:50.170 --> 02:25:50.180 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
02:25:53.330 --> 02:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
that pushed the Sy that pushed the sysc
 
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
Frontline staff salaries to really be in
 
02:25:58.730 --> 02:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
the range of like 15 to 20 an hour which
 
02:26:00.889 --> 02:26:00.899 align:start position:0%
if you go and look at what folks are
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
paying at grocery stores and such right
 
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the current environment that's not
 
02:26:07.070 --> 02:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
incredibly competitive
 
02:26:08.330 --> 02:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
um and that was after the salary
 
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
enhancements right so I think this is
 
02:26:12.410 --> 02:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
all happening in the context of a few
 
02:26:14.690 --> 02:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
other things right that I that I don't
 
02:26:16.429 --> 02:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
think we have direct control over in the
 
02:26:17.809 --> 02:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
immediate term but that I do think in
 
02:26:19.370 --> 02:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
the long term should be or in the
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
intermediate term should be thought
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
about right
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
um one you know we do have an overall
 
02:26:25.969 --> 02:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
Workforce issue in the state in general
 
02:26:28.190 --> 02:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
and specifically in areas of direct care
 
02:26:31.250 --> 02:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
right so Direct Care in all different
 
02:26:33.650 --> 02:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
settings but particularly in my in my
 
02:26:35.090 --> 02:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse and where I'm concerned is
 
02:26:36.590 --> 02:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
around people who provide Direct Care in
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
residential settings that's true for a
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
private residential programs it's true
 
02:26:42.770 --> 02:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
for sysa and it's not just a New
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire issue every state in the
 
02:26:46.010 --> 02:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
country is facing the same thing I get
 
02:26:47.690 --> 02:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
Clips sent to my email every morning
 
02:26:49.309 --> 02:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
from around the country for Juvenile
 
02:26:50.990 --> 02:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
Justice and child welfare related issues
 
02:26:52.730 --> 02:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
and you'll see a story that sounds just
 
02:26:55.370 --> 02:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
like this all over the place so I think
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's a big issue there and that the
 
02:26:58.969 --> 02:26:58.979 align:start position:0%
the workforce the compensation for that
 
02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
type of work hasn't really kept pace
 
02:27:02.809 --> 02:27:02.819 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the economy so I do
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
think there's an opportunity to think
 
02:27:05.150 --> 02:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
about what is an intermediate or
 
02:27:07.130 --> 02:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
long-term solution to that problem what
 
02:27:08.809 --> 02:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
we're really proposing at this moment is
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
just a Band-Aid to try to get us get us
 
02:27:15.010 --> 02:27:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
02:27:20.270 --> 02:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none could I have a motion to
 
02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:21.530 align:start position:0%
seeing none could I have a motion to

02:27:21.530 --> 02:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
accept
 
02:27:27.710 --> 02:27:27.720 align:start position:0%

we do we we kind of cheated she worked
 
02:29:02.570 --> 02:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
for us before a few years ago so we had
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
a little uh leg up on that but it
 
02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter how how it happened it's
 
02:29:08.809 --> 02:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
good that it happened
 
02:29:11.210 --> 02:29:11.220 align:start position:0%

02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
pfas in our landfills
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
so are there any questions on any of the
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
other information items
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
yes Lottery
 
02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.359 --> 02:29:48.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:29:48.290 --> 02:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.690 --> 02:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
hi Jim Durst CFO New Hampshire Lottery
 
02:29:50.700 --> 02:29:52.490 align:start position:0%
hi Jim Durst CFO New Hampshire Lottery
Commission

02:29:52.490 --> 02:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for taking my question so I
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
think I noted a decline of about 6.7
 
02:30:01.130 --> 02:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
million in sales could you just tell us
 
02:30:05.210 --> 02:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
why we're seeing a decline yes uh
 
02:30:07.490 --> 02:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
there's really two factors in there uh
 
02:30:09.530 --> 02:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
During the covid period our sales
 
02:30:11.450 --> 02:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
increased greatly
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh with sharp sharp increases that were
 
02:30:15.770 --> 02:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
unexpected at the time
 
02:30:17.809 --> 02:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
so we're having the combination of that
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
coming back a little more to reality
 
02:30:21.650 --> 02:30:21.660 align:start position:0%
what I would call reality is the finance
 
02:30:23.450 --> 02:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
person but
 
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
um coming back more into line still over
 
02:30:28.490 --> 02:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
prior years if you go back to 22 and 20
 
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
we're still above those numbers just not
 
02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
going where 21 was
 
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh secondary we also see the rising
 
02:30:38.570 --> 02:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
prices of food gas prices things like
 
02:30:40.730 --> 02:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
that which obviously have especially gas
 
02:30:43.010 --> 02:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
I have a direct direct effect of when
 
02:30:44.330 --> 02:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
you buy gas
 
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
and go into that store you don't have as
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
much free money to spend on tickets all
 
02:30:52.130 --> 02:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
right uh thanks thanks Madam chair
 
02:30:54.170 --> 02:30:54.180 align:start position:0%
you know it's interesting I got the same
 
02:30:56.809 --> 02:30:56.819 align:start position:0%
answer from uh
 
02:31:00.110 --> 02:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre so they're talking to
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
each other which is which is good to
 
02:31:04.490 --> 02:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
know so thank you very much thank you
 
02:31:07.010 --> 02:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
very much you're welcome
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
so uh d h a or yeah right Environmental
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
folks if you would
 
02:31:19.250 --> 02:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh I think all of you received a
 
02:31:21.650 --> 02:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
copy of
 
02:31:24.290 --> 02:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
the briefing
 
02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:25.730 align:start position:0%
the briefing
so

02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:28.250 --> 02:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
this kind of um
 
02:31:31.250 --> 02:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
there was something that
 
02:31:34.370 --> 02:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
came about that said this is a this is a
 
02:31:35.870 --> 02:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
problem that
 
02:31:38.330 --> 02:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
um we're going to be facing
 
02:31:43.250 --> 02:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
probably in the in the next budget and
 
02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
I I don't know where
 
02:31:47.870 --> 02:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to get all this money from
 
02:31:50.210 --> 02:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
so if you would commissioner please
 
02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record my
 
02:31:54.349 --> 02:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
name is Mike wimsat I service director
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
of the waste management division for New
 
02:31:59.210 --> 02:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire des and with me today is Jamie
 
02:32:01.490 --> 02:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
O'Rourke who is a hydrogeologist in our
 
02:32:03.530 --> 02:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
house of space remediation Bureau and
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
much of his work focuses on landfills
 
02:32:09.050 --> 02:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
and landfill monitoring uh as as the
 
02:32:10.730 --> 02:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
chair indicated there's a question that
 
02:32:13.550 --> 02:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
came up in a prior meeting about pfas
 
02:32:14.929 --> 02:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
particularly as it relates to our
 
02:32:17.090 --> 02:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
landfills in the state and as it relates
 
02:32:19.610 --> 02:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
specifically to its presence in leachate
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
which you'll as you'll learn from Jamie
 
02:32:23.990 --> 02:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
is a significant management issue for
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
for landfills that do collect it
 
02:32:29.090 --> 02:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
um so uh I'm with that I'm just gonna I
 
02:32:30.830 --> 02:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
know we've got running late here today
 
02:32:32.270 --> 02:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn it right over to Jamie
 
02:32:34.429 --> 02:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
he's got a presentation that I believe
 
02:32:35.570 --> 02:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
has been shared with the committee
 
02:32:37.730 --> 02:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
members probably runs about 15 minutes
 
02:32:40.130 --> 02:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
or so in length and and we'll be happy
 
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions either along the
 
02:32:45.050 --> 02:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
way or after Jamie's completed
 
02:32:45.060 --> 02:32:46.809 align:start position:0%
way or after Jamie's completed
foreign

02:32:46.809 --> 02:32:46.819 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon we do have copies of the
 
02:32:51.650 --> 02:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
presentation if if someone doesn't have
 
02:33:03.290 --> 02:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:05.450 --> 02:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
I've got 25 more here if you if you
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:11.389 --> 02:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
please go ahead thank you very much good
 
02:33:13.010 --> 02:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
afternoon everyone
 
02:33:15.830 --> 02:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
um we were invited over to give a quick
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
little discussion on pfas occurrence in
 
02:33:19.730 --> 02:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
leachate at New Hampshire landfills and
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
on the interest of time I'll I'll be
 
02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
moving rather quickly on some of these
 
02:33:25.450 --> 02:33:25.460 align:start position:0%
slides that are more uh high level
 
02:33:28.130 --> 02:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
within the first several Pages these are
 
02:33:29.809 --> 02:33:29.819 align:start position:0%
numbered as well if you'll note in the
 
02:33:32.210 --> 02:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
bottom right hand corner we have a the
 
02:33:34.010 --> 02:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
first page here is a listing of the
 
02:33:36.830 --> 02:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
active lined Municipal Solid Waste
 
02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
landfills here in New Hampshire
 
02:33:40.969 --> 02:33:40.979 align:start position:0%
along with their locations the next page
 
02:33:42.590 --> 02:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
is simply a listing of the various
 
02:33:45.170 --> 02:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
wastes that can be found or disposed of
 
02:33:46.730 --> 02:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire landfills not all
 
02:33:48.590 --> 02:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
landfills can take all of these wastes
 
02:33:50.510 --> 02:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
but a majority of them and all of them
 
02:33:52.370 --> 02:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
for certain will be taking Municipal
 
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
solid waste and wastewater treatment
 
02:33:56.030 --> 02:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
plant sludge which we'll be discussing
 
02:33:57.290 --> 02:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
in a few minutes
 
02:33:59.570 --> 02:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
as we move along here landfill leachate
 
02:34:01.490 --> 02:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
Management in New Hampshire leachate is
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
actually defined in the solid waste
 
02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
rules it means a liquid including any
 
02:34:08.090 --> 02:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
suspended components in the liquid which
 
02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
has contacted or passed through Salt
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
passed through solid waste as that
 
02:34:15.410 --> 02:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
liquid passes through a landfilled waste
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
Mass it leeches or extracts chemicals or
 
02:34:20.330 --> 02:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
constitutes from the wastes as those
 
02:34:21.650 --> 02:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
waste break down
 
02:34:23.510 --> 02:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
along with pfas this can include
 
02:34:25.070 --> 02:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
numerous different chemicals and
 
02:34:28.130 --> 02:34:28.140 align:start position:0%
compounds as well as the pfas organic
 
02:34:29.570 --> 02:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
compounds heavy metals chlorides
 
02:34:32.030 --> 02:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
nitrates so on and so forth the material
 
02:34:34.490 --> 02:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
ends up being quite a quite a noxious
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
fluid very thick viscous almost like a
 
02:34:40.010 --> 02:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
brine or a thick soup if you will very
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:47.450 --> 02:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
following the discovery and of the
 
02:34:49.849 --> 02:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
extent of pfas impacts to the southern
 
02:34:52.010 --> 02:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
southern part of New Hampshire Des
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
started becoming concerned about the
 
02:34:56.210 --> 02:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
potential for pfas within the landfills
 
02:34:58.429 --> 02:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
and specifically the landfill leachate
 
02:35:01.490 --> 02:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
in 2018 Des conducted an initial
 
02:35:03.469 --> 02:35:03.479 align:start position:0%
sampling survey of leachate from nine
 
02:35:05.570 --> 02:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
landfills in New Hampshire that includes
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
the six Active landfills as well as
 
02:35:09.830 --> 02:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
three closed landfills that also
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
generate leachate the results results
 
02:35:16.130 --> 02:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
were rather rather interesting and very
 
02:35:18.590 --> 02:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
wide-ranging a wide variety of pfas were
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
detected at varying concentrations
 
02:35:22.730 --> 02:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
across the board all nine landfills had
 
02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
pfas it wasn't there wasn't necessarily
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
a theme or a Rhyme or Reason as to the
 
02:35:29.570 --> 02:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
scale or size or even age of the
 
02:35:31.309 --> 02:35:31.319 align:start position:0%
landfill whether it be closed or still
 
02:35:31.319 --> 02:35:32.690 align:start position:0%
landfill whether it be closed or still
active

02:35:32.690 --> 02:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
active
 
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
the next study that kind of came to our
 
02:35:37.730 --> 02:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
uh attention was actually our
 
02:35:39.290 --> 02:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
neighboring state of Vermont in 2019
 
02:35:41.929 --> 02:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
they required their their only operating
 
02:35:44.030 --> 02:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
landfill to conduct a study of potential
 
02:35:46.730 --> 02:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
pfest sources in waste Stream So
 
02:35:48.110 --> 02:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
essentially what they did is they had
 
02:35:51.710 --> 02:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
their landfills uh sample the waste as
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
it was coming into the facility trying
 
02:35:56.450 --> 02:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
to determine where are we seeing this
 
02:35:58.730 --> 02:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
pfas and our leachate coming from well
 
02:36:00.830 --> 02:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
the answer was it's pretty much across
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
the board there's a snippet of a slide
 
02:36:04.309 --> 02:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page that I've
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
included and you can see there's pfas
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
detections across the board from sludge
 
02:36:10.750 --> 02:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
to bulky items textiles carpeting
 
02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
mattresses couches so on and so forth so
 
02:36:18.290 --> 02:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
there is as we all know now which we
 
02:36:19.910 --> 02:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily know as much in 2019
 
02:36:22.309 --> 02:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
as pfas is rather prevalent across our
 
02:36:22.319 --> 02:36:24.469 align:start position:0%
as pfas is rather prevalent across our
society

02:36:24.469 --> 02:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
society
 
02:36:25.849 --> 02:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire the current
 
02:36:27.290 --> 02:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
management of leachate is rather
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
Universal leachate is captured in the
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
landfill's liner system below the waist
 
02:36:34.610 --> 02:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh that's there and it's either shipped
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
or piped to a wastewater treatment plant
 
02:36:38.809 --> 02:36:38.819 align:start position:0%
it's about 50 50 versus trucked versus
 
02:36:42.530 --> 02:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
shipped with our active landfills at the
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant and within
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
the process itself there is a negligible
 
02:36:48.290 --> 02:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
destruction of pfas in fact it
 
02:36:50.270 --> 02:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
partitions off to the water effluent as
 
02:36:52.849 --> 02:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
well as the biosolid sludge material
 
02:36:55.370 --> 02:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
as a result there's relative impacts on
 
02:36:57.770 --> 02:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
the back end the receiving water quality
 
02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
has will show impacts from pfas and the
 
02:37:02.330 --> 02:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
receipt and the sludge itself shows
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
impacts as well potentially limiting its
 
02:37:07.610 --> 02:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
management options instead of being able
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
to possibly be used in land spreading or
 
02:37:12.410 --> 02:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
composting one of the other options is
 
02:37:14.450 --> 02:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
that it goes to landfills in fact a
 
02:37:16.849 --> 02:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
majority of it does
 
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
there is one active landfill in New
 
02:37:20.389 --> 02:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that actually pre-treats its
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
lead shape which we'll be talking about
 
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
in a little bit
 
02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't necessarily designed to be
 
02:37:28.429 --> 02:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
simple to be uh pre-treating for pfas is
 
02:37:30.530 --> 02:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh the turnkey landfill in Rochester
 
02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
they've actually been pre-treating their
 
02:37:35.210 --> 02:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
leachate since the 1990s so well before
 
02:37:38.210 --> 02:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
our knowledge of pfas uh came around
 
02:37:39.770 --> 02:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about in a little bit more
 
02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
detail they've been doing some
 
02:37:41.809 --> 02:37:41.819 align:start position:0%
interesting work that we've been
 
02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
discussing with them but as I outlined
 
02:37:46.130 --> 02:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
above there's essentially this cyclical
 
02:37:47.929 --> 02:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
relationship between landfills and
 
02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants a landfill
 
02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
generates lead shade it gets shipped to
 
02:37:53.630 --> 02:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
a wastewater treatment plant the
 
02:37:55.490 --> 02:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant generates a
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
biosolid and many in most cases it gets
 
02:38:00.170 --> 02:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
shipped back to a ship to a landfill
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
there are obviously a couple of
 
02:38:03.889 --> 02:38:03.899 align:start position:0%
offshoots off of that relationship with
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
the water effluent which may come off
 
02:38:08.210 --> 02:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
and impact streams and and rivers and
 
02:38:10.130 --> 02:38:10.140 align:start position:0%
then also the biosols component in some
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
cases there are some beneficial uses
 
02:38:13.370 --> 02:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
that are there in which they have been
 
02:38:15.849 --> 02:38:15.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:19.250 --> 02:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
on the next page we have a a table of
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
the various volumes of leachate that
 
02:38:23.809 --> 02:38:23.819 align:start position:0%
have been generated at the at the sixth
 
02:38:26.090 --> 02:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
Municipal Solid Waste landfills across
 
02:38:27.410 --> 02:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire these are the last three
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
years of numbers that we have as you can
 
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
see the numbers vary greatly from
 
02:38:33.889 --> 02:38:33.899 align:start position:0%
location to location uh but also from
 
02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
within facility uh from year to year as
 
02:38:38.330 --> 02:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
well now the numbers obviously will
 
02:38:40.429 --> 02:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
relate to the landfill size and scale of
 
02:38:42.790 --> 02:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
operations but there are some
 
02:38:45.110 --> 02:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
operational steps that a landfill can
 
02:38:46.969 --> 02:38:46.979 align:start position:0%
take to limit the amount of water that
 
02:38:49.309 --> 02:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
infiltrates into the waste Mass if you
 
02:38:51.770 --> 02:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
use a tighter cover on a daily basis you
 
02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
can shed some of that water instead of
 
02:38:55.250 --> 02:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
generating as much so there are some
 
02:38:56.990 --> 02:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
potential steps you can take to to limit
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
landfill each eight generation
 
02:39:00.770 --> 02:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page there are six
 
02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
closed landfills that also generate
 
02:39:05.090 --> 02:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
leachate they generate leachate at a
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
much much smaller rate given that they
 
02:39:08.570 --> 02:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
are closed they are capped with an
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
impervious material to prevent liquid
 
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
and water and rain water today from
 
02:39:14.809 --> 02:39:14.819 align:start position:0%
migrating through the waste mass and
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
generating more leachate essentially
 
02:39:18.530 --> 02:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
with a with a liner underneath and the
 
02:39:20.090 --> 02:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
cap on the top we've created somewhat of
 
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
a closed system so the leachate is
 
02:39:24.050 --> 02:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
coming out and those numbers drop off
 
02:39:26.330 --> 02:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
precipitously after closure almost
 
02:39:31.550 --> 02:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
um we wanted to take the time today to
 
02:39:34.910 --> 02:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
discuss at least very briefly the
 
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
occurrence of pfas and groundwater at
 
02:39:38.450 --> 02:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire landfills we obviously
 
02:39:41.150 --> 02:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
have this these occurrences in leachate
 
02:39:44.510 --> 02:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
and we have been aware of and sampling
 
02:39:46.990 --> 02:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
land around landfills consistently
 
02:39:49.849 --> 02:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
Des required groundwater sampling from
 
02:39:51.950 --> 02:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
4p fast it all lined and unlined
 
02:39:53.809 --> 02:39:53.819 align:start position:0%
landfills that have groundwater release
 
02:39:55.250 --> 02:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
detection or groundwater management
 
02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
permits so groundwater monitoring
 
02:39:59.270 --> 02:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
permits that run in perpetuity
 
02:40:01.010 --> 02:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
essentially for the landfill's Existence
 
02:40:02.330 --> 02:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
and Beyond
 
02:40:05.809 --> 02:40:05.819 align:start position:0%
as of March of 2022 90 of the landfills
 
02:40:08.330 --> 02:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
have been sampled for pfas this includes
 
02:40:09.889 --> 02:40:09.899 align:start position:0%
all the lined landfills and all the
 
02:40:11.809 --> 02:40:11.819 align:start position:0%
active landfills as well
 
02:40:16.010 --> 02:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
91 of those have had pfas detections 77
 
02:40:18.110 --> 02:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
percent have had pfas detected over
 
02:40:20.150 --> 02:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
ambient groundwater quality standards or
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
agqs standards for one or more of the
 
02:40:25.849 --> 02:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
four pfas that we regulate
 
02:40:28.910 --> 02:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
a not unsignificant number is 22 and a
 
02:40:31.730 --> 02:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
half percent on that last line we've had
 
02:40:34.070 --> 02:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
that that number of landfills that have
 
02:40:36.830 --> 02:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
either had pfas detected below standard
 
02:40:38.809 --> 02:40:38.819 align:start position:0%
or not detected at all in groundwater
 
02:40:40.910 --> 02:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
sampling around them
 
02:40:43.250 --> 02:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page there's a
 
02:40:44.450 --> 02:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
table where those numbers and
 
02:40:46.610 --> 02:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
percentages were derived from
 
02:40:48.349 --> 02:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
um just a
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
just a little reference point for you
 
02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
when you look at the lined landfills
 
02:40:53.090 --> 02:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
some of the line landfills in New
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have online landfills
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
associated with them either butting up
 
02:40:58.250 --> 02:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
against them or right next door so when
 
02:40:59.870 --> 02:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
we calculate those numbers when we look
 
02:41:02.090 --> 02:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
at that monitoring data those might be
 
02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative more of the online
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
landfill as opposed to some kind of
 
02:41:07.130 --> 02:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
operational challenge with the line
 
02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:10.250 align:start position:0%
operational challenge with the line
system

02:41:10.250 --> 02:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:13.130 --> 02:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
the next page is essentially uh the the
 
02:41:14.570 --> 02:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
same numbers presented in a slightly
 
02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
different way just a simple pie chart
 
02:41:18.349 --> 02:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
for us you can see the three quarters of
 
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
the landfills have detections over agqs
 
02:41:22.130 --> 02:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
and the other 22 percent how they're
 
02:41:26.450 --> 02:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
divided we have uh had 174 landfills in
 
02:41:28.610 --> 02:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire screened for pfas at this
 
02:41:30.530 --> 02:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
time we're hoping and anticipating being
 
02:41:34.130 --> 02:41:34.140 align:start position:0%
able to get the rest on board as well
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
one note here the the data from this
 
02:41:38.990 --> 02:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
groundwater information uh was submitted
 
02:41:41.150 --> 02:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh previously in our status report on
 
02:41:43.670 --> 02:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
the occurrence of pfas contamination in
 
02:41:45.889 --> 02:41:45.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire dated June of 2022 much
 
02:41:47.090 --> 02:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
bigger report that I believe was
 
02:41:50.510 --> 02:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:51.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:41:51.349 --> 02:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:53.389 --> 02:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
obviously with groundwater impacts at
 
02:41:55.910 --> 02:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
landfills Des is always concerned about
 
02:41:57.650 --> 02:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
drinking water because groundwater is
 
02:41:59.210 --> 02:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
such an essential source of drinking
 
02:42:02.510 --> 02:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
water in New Hampshire as a result there
 
02:42:04.370 --> 02:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
has been extensive drinking water
 
02:42:06.410 --> 02:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
sampling around landfills conducted by
 
02:42:08.090 --> 02:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
the responsible parties municipalities
 
02:42:10.969 --> 02:42:10.979 align:start position:0%
and such pfas has been detected in
 
02:42:12.650 --> 02:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
drinking water supply Wells exceeding
 
02:42:15.590 --> 02:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
agqs at six closed landfill sites
 
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
totaling 24 water supplies that have
 
02:42:19.730 --> 02:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
been impacted
 
02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
each of those impacted Water Supplies
 
02:42:23.630 --> 02:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
has been provided a permanent potable
 
02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
water solution so either some kind of
 
02:42:26.990 --> 02:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
treatment system on their water supply
 
02:42:29.270 --> 02:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
well or a connection to a water utility
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
or they're being provided bottled water
 
02:42:33.170 --> 02:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
until such a permanent solution can be
 
02:42:36.230 --> 02:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
provided by the responsible party in
 
02:42:37.550 --> 02:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
approximately half of these cases
 
02:42:39.290 --> 02:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
contaminants other than pfas were
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
previously detected at the water supply
 
02:42:43.490 --> 02:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
Wells above their respected agqs so
 
02:42:45.230 --> 02:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
about 12 of these were already being
 
02:42:47.330 --> 02:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
monitored for other impacts from a
 
02:42:49.849 --> 02:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
landfill and as a result of pfas coming
 
02:42:52.130 --> 02:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
onto our radar screen we decided that
 
02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
they needed a sample for pfas as well
 
02:42:55.190 --> 02:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
and it was found as part of the process
 
02:42:58.130 --> 02:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
those residents were probably already on
 
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
treatment systems already
 
02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh at the bottom to note to note uh to
 
02:43:04.429 --> 02:43:04.439 align:start position:0%
date there have been no detections of
 
02:43:06.530 --> 02:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
pfas over agqs and water supply Wells
 
02:43:08.090 --> 02:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
that have been sampled near active
 
02:43:08.100 --> 02:43:10.370 align:start position:0%
that have been sampled near active
landfills

02:43:10.370 --> 02:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
02:43:12.650 --> 02:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
so we framed the the challenge to frame
 
02:43:14.210 --> 02:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
the issue a little bit and what are some
 
02:43:15.469 --> 02:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
potential steps we can take in the
 
02:43:17.330 --> 02:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
future to deal with this deal with
 
02:43:17.340 --> 02:43:18.469 align:start position:0%
future to deal with this deal with
leachate

02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
leachate
 
02:43:19.849 --> 02:43:19.859 align:start position:0%
um we could continue on with the current
 
02:43:21.170 --> 02:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
practice where wastewater treatment
 
02:43:23.570 --> 02:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
plants uh are required to just meet
 
02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
their applicable standards so if if
 
02:43:27.770 --> 02:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
there were and will be surface water
 
02:43:29.809 --> 02:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
standards for pfas enacted the
 
02:43:31.550 --> 02:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant would end up
 
02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
needed to be able to comply with those
 
02:43:36.290 --> 02:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
that would also relate to possibly the
 
02:43:37.670 --> 02:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
sludge disposal whether it be
 
02:43:39.410 --> 02:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
limitations on their ability to be used
 
02:43:44.450 --> 02:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we could do if we
 
02:43:47.690 --> 02:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
could wanted to consider a requirement
 
02:43:50.090 --> 02:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
to pre-treat the leachate before it's in
 
02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
place into the wastewater treatment
 
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
plants process you could have on-site
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment infrastructure at the
 
02:43:56.690 --> 02:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
landfills you could develop a
 
02:43:57.950 --> 02:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment infrastructure at the
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant so that it's
 
02:44:01.730 --> 02:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
not getting under the system one of the
 
02:44:03.050 --> 02:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
other ideas that has been thrown around
 
02:44:04.849 --> 02:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
a little bit and has received some
 
02:44:07.730 --> 02:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
positive uh positive feedback is the
 
02:44:08.929 --> 02:44:08.939 align:start position:0%
idea of a regional pre-treatment
 
02:44:10.490 --> 02:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
facility where these landfills bring
 
02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
their leachate so that it can be treated
 
02:44:14.750 --> 02:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately by a state-of-the-art type
 
02:44:17.090 --> 02:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
facility and and then have it disposed
 
02:44:18.530 --> 02:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
of at a wastewater treatment plant you
 
02:44:19.849 --> 02:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
could co-locate this with a waste
 
02:44:22.670 --> 02:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
recruitment plant possibly
 
02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:23.210 align:start position:0%
recruitment plant possibly
um

02:44:23.210 --> 02:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
one of the other things we need to
 
02:44:26.690 --> 02:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
consider as we go through this process
 
02:44:29.450 --> 02:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
and evaluation is is what's the
 
02:44:31.130 --> 02:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
significance of the benefit by removing
 
02:44:33.050 --> 02:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
the pfast that leachate brings into a
 
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant how much pfas
 
02:44:36.770 --> 02:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
are we removing from the total that may
 
02:44:38.929 --> 02:44:38.939 align:start position:0%
be coming out of the pipe as we talked
 
02:44:41.210 --> 02:44:41.220 align:start position:0%
about the potential waste waste that go
 
02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
into landfills we know that pfas is is
 
02:44:45.710 --> 02:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
prevalent throughout our society where
 
02:44:47.150 --> 02:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
it was raining this morning if we had
 
02:44:48.349 --> 02:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
Gore-Tex or some kind of other
 
02:44:51.050 --> 02:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
waterproofing on we might have had pfas
 
02:44:53.450 --> 02:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
and a part of our clothing Cosmetics so
 
02:44:55.130 --> 02:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
on and so forth so
 
02:44:57.230 --> 02:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
there will be significant pfas and
 
02:44:59.090 --> 02:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant already how
 
02:45:01.370 --> 02:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
much how much help are we giving by
 
02:45:04.130 --> 02:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
removing this pfest from the leachate
 
02:45:05.570 --> 02:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
there is significant sampling that's
 
02:45:07.309 --> 02:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
been being done by DES in the Water
 
02:45:09.230 --> 02:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
Division to be able to make some
 
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
informed decisions on this as we move
 
02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:13.190 align:start position:0%
informed decisions on this as we move
forward

02:45:13.190 --> 02:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:15.349 --> 02:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
so there are treatment technologies that
 
02:45:17.210 --> 02:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
would be available for us to be able to
 
02:45:19.070 --> 02:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
treat leachate the first three may look
 
02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
rather familiar to you they've been used
 
02:45:22.490 --> 02:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
extensively across New Hampshire to
 
02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
treat drinking water supplies that have
 
02:45:26.990 --> 02:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
been impacted by pfas with granulated
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
activated carbon ion exchange resin and
 
02:45:31.610 --> 02:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
reverse osmosis
 
02:45:33.530 --> 02:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
as I indicated earlier one of the
 
02:45:35.570 --> 02:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
challenges that at this stage with
 
02:45:38.450 --> 02:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
dealing with leachate is it's is its
 
02:45:40.429 --> 02:45:40.439 align:start position:0%
viscosity is its components is it
 
02:45:42.650 --> 02:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
suspended solids if you were to apply
 
02:45:44.450 --> 02:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
pfas to one of these Technologies
 
02:45:46.250 --> 02:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
directly you would end up fouling the
 
02:45:48.590 --> 02:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
system almost into almost instantaneous
 
02:45:50.690 --> 02:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis so what you end up
 
02:45:52.130 --> 02:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
needing to do is have what's called a
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
treatment trainer sequence of treatments
 
02:45:55.969 --> 02:45:55.979 align:start position:0%
that can get the leachate to the point
 
02:45:57.590 --> 02:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
of being able to use this technology
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's not impossible in fact it is is it
 
02:46:03.410 --> 02:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
is done it just adds a great develop
 
02:46:05.090 --> 02:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
complexity and maintenance related to
 
02:46:08.030 --> 02:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:09.950 --> 02:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
um there are new in emerging
 
02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
contaminants or new and emerging
 
02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
Technologies for these emerging
 
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
contaminants foam fractionation which is
 
02:46:17.210 --> 02:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
the generation of a pfast foam off the
 
02:46:18.290 --> 02:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
top of the leachate that could be
 
02:46:19.809 --> 02:46:19.819 align:start position:0%
skimmed off and disposed of
 
02:46:22.190 --> 02:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
stabilization or encapsulation which is
 
02:46:24.050 --> 02:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
the creation essentially of a solid or a
 
02:46:26.030 --> 02:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
concrete that can then be disposed of
 
02:46:28.190 --> 02:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
back into the landfill one of the ones
 
02:46:29.270 --> 02:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're most interested in is
 
02:46:32.330 --> 02:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
supercritical water oxidation it is a
 
02:46:33.650 --> 02:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
relatively new technology that's being
 
02:46:35.690 --> 02:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
tested out there but it actually applies
 
02:46:37.730 --> 02:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
heat and pressure to be able to destroy
 
02:46:40.250 --> 02:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
the pfas compound obviously very ideal
 
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
very much on the front end there are
 
02:46:44.270 --> 02:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
some pilot studies out there that we are
 
02:46:45.469 --> 02:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
aware of in fact the Wastewater
 
02:46:47.870 --> 02:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
engineering Bureau has received a
 
02:46:50.090 --> 02:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Grant to be able to run a
 
02:46:53.030 --> 02:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
pilot treatment a pilot study on
 
02:46:55.070 --> 02:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
treatment of leachate from a wastewater
 
02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
treatment or from a landfill prior to
 
02:46:59.630 --> 02:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
its being delivered to a wastewater
 
02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
treatment plant they're hoping to get
 
02:47:03.889 --> 02:47:03.899 align:start position:0%
numbers out of that within 20 in in 2023
 
02:47:06.710 --> 02:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
in the summer summer of 2023
 
02:47:09.830 --> 02:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
um the turkey landfill right of
 
02:47:12.530 --> 02:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
Rochester landfill excuse me they've
 
02:47:13.610 --> 02:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
also been running their own pilot
 
02:47:15.050 --> 02:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
studies as a commercial entity they've
 
02:47:16.429 --> 02:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
been doing this
 
02:47:18.710 --> 02:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
um and we became aware of uh some rather
 
02:47:20.690 --> 02:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
interesting information uh that they
 
02:47:22.490 --> 02:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
provided to us and that they've had
 
02:47:24.349 --> 02:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
successful runs of of running a pilot
 
02:47:26.510 --> 02:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
study on a full-scale basis uh they're
 
02:47:28.429 --> 02:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
hoping to be able to take the next steps
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
into the future so we hope to be able to
 
02:47:32.030 --> 02:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
learn a lot from them as they move on
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
with actual operational uh uh Tendencies
 
02:47:38.270 --> 02:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes to the treatment of
 
02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:39.950 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes to the treatment of
leachate

02:47:39.950 --> 02:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
leachate
 
02:47:42.050 --> 02:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh in summary there are six Active
 
02:47:44.030 --> 02:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal Solid Waste landfills in New
 
02:47:44.809 --> 02:47:44.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are generating
 
02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
approximately 96 million gallons of
 
02:47:49.070 --> 02:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
leachate per year leachate quantities
 
02:47:51.530 --> 02:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
generated generated very widely by
 
02:47:53.690 --> 02:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
landfill uh generally based on landfill
 
02:47:55.690 --> 02:47:55.700 align:start position:0%
size but not exclusively there are some
 
02:47:57.770 --> 02:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
operational steps you can take the limit
 
02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
that generation operational time frames
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
and landfill sizes do not always
 
02:48:04.190 --> 02:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
correlate with the concentrations of
 
02:48:07.130 --> 02:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
pfas and leachate pfas is found on a
 
02:48:09.530 --> 02:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
wide ranging number of waste types there
 
02:48:11.090 --> 02:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
is this cyclical relationship we
 
02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
discussed uh between landfills and
 
02:48:14.389 --> 02:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants where the
 
02:48:16.250 --> 02:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
landfill generates leachate gets sent to
 
02:48:17.570 --> 02:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
a wastewater treatment plant the
 
02:48:19.010 --> 02:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant generates
 
02:48:21.050 --> 02:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
biosolid it gets sent back to the
 
02:48:22.250 --> 02:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
landfill itself
 
02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
there are potential ha treatment options
 
02:48:25.610 --> 02:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
as we discussed they haven't been fully
 
02:48:27.290 --> 02:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
vetted necessarily at an operational
 
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
level at New Hampshire landfills and uh
 
02:48:32.090 --> 02:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
as I discussed on the last slide there
 
02:48:33.170 --> 02:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
are some pilot studies that we're going
 
02:48:35.090 --> 02:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
to get some information from over the
 
02:48:36.830 --> 02:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
next year or so
 
02:48:38.389 --> 02:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
on last page I've included my contact
 
02:48:40.010 --> 02:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
information as direct as well as
 
02:48:42.469 --> 02:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
director wimsatz we are available for
 
02:48:44.150 --> 02:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
questions if there's time now or if you
 
02:48:45.530 --> 02:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
have questions at another time you can
 
02:48:50.809 --> 02:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:55.309 --> 02:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
oh go ahead Senator gray sorry uh since
 
02:48:58.190 --> 02:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
I'm also a city councilman in Rochester
 
02:49:02.990 --> 02:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh the history of why their pre-treat in
 
02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester has to do with nitrogen and
 
02:49:08.570 --> 02:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
nitrate because of the discharges in the
 
02:49:12.469 --> 02:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
conchico river which is impaired for and
 
02:49:15.710 --> 02:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
so it didn't have anything to do with
 
02:49:19.610 --> 02:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
PF compounds I just want to make sure
 
02:49:22.969 --> 02:49:22.979 align:start position:0%
that that's clear and waste management I
 
02:49:25.130 --> 02:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
didn't even know that they were running
 
02:49:30.230 --> 02:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
a pilot on pfas yeah they um I had a
 
02:49:31.250 --> 02:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
conversation with them just very
 
02:49:33.230 --> 02:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
recently where I mentioned that we were
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
going to have this discussion and I
 
02:49:36.349 --> 02:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
wanted a bit of an update as to what
 
02:49:39.050 --> 02:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
they were doing and they dropped this on
 
02:49:40.910 --> 02:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
us in a favorable way there's no
 
02:49:43.070 --> 02:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
requirement from us for them to be
 
02:49:44.990 --> 02:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
they're pre-treating their leachate as
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
you discussed it's a local local matter
 
02:49:49.130 --> 02:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
and the pfas component I think is a
 
02:49:51.590 --> 02:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
matter of disposal for an economic
 
02:49:52.969 --> 02:49:52.979 align:start position:0%
standpoint at one point they were
 
02:49:54.530 --> 02:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
shipping their leachate all the way down
 
02:49:56.210 --> 02:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
to I think New Jersey at some point
 
02:49:59.450 --> 02:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
that's not sustainable for them so they
 
02:50:01.969 --> 02:50:01.979 align:start position:0%
I think invested in monies into trying
 
02:50:03.710 --> 02:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
to take the next steps into keeping it
 
02:50:07.210 --> 02:50:07.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:10.610 --> 02:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
it's rather scary when your landfill
 
02:50:13.490 --> 02:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
says to your wastewater treatment plant
 
02:50:16.790 --> 02:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
you cannot bring your leachate to me
 
02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:18.590 align:start position:0%
you cannot bring your leachate to me
anymore

02:50:18.590 --> 02:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
02:50:21.050 --> 02:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
because then you're kind of looking
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:27.770 --> 02:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
I don't want it in my backyard but uh
 
02:50:31.010 --> 02:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
it's it's the kind of thing that I'm I'm
 
02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
really really concerned that this is
 
02:50:39.530 --> 02:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
going to blow up in our faces and that's
 
02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
that I think is a real problem
 
02:50:45.770 --> 02:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
I mean everybody that has a
 
02:50:48.050 --> 02:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't have a
 
02:50:52.250 --> 02:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
has to have their uh tanks pumped all
 
02:50:54.469 --> 02:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
that goes to some
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant
 
02:50:58.490 --> 02:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that the
 
02:51:03.950 --> 02:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:06.710 --> 02:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
thing that you have at home is higher
 
02:51:10.370 --> 02:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
than what comes into the wastewater
 
02:51:12.530 --> 02:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
treatment plant through the sewer system
 
02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
02:51:18.309 --> 02:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
02:51:21.530 --> 02:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
well thank you madam chair if I may um
 
02:51:24.469 --> 02:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
you raised a really good point so it as
 
02:51:27.170 --> 02:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
as with many topics it's very sometimes
 
02:51:29.929 --> 02:51:29.939 align:start position:0%
very location and facility specific
 
02:51:31.610 --> 02:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
um you know a landfill that sends its
 
02:51:34.010 --> 02:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
leachate to a fairly large scale
 
02:51:36.290 --> 02:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant that has many
 
02:51:38.389 --> 02:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
millions of gallons a day of flow that
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's treating
 
02:51:42.889 --> 02:51:42.899 align:start position:0%
um that daily shipment may not represent
 
02:51:45.050 --> 02:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
a significant portion of the influent to
 
02:51:47.150 --> 02:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
that plant and in fact as Jamie
 
02:51:49.490 --> 02:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
indicated it may not represent a
 
02:51:52.190 --> 02:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
significant proportion of the pfas that
 
02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
comes to that plant in any given day and
 
02:51:56.150 --> 02:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
therefore doesn't necessarily influence
 
02:51:58.490 --> 02:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
the final concentration in the receiving
 
02:52:00.290 --> 02:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
stream most of those large volume
 
02:52:02.990 --> 02:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
Wastewater plants discharge to a
 
02:52:05.150 --> 02:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
relatively large river you know
 
02:52:07.370 --> 02:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
receiving body on the other hand there
 
02:52:09.590 --> 02:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
may be other small Wastewater plants as
 
02:52:10.969 --> 02:52:10.979 align:start position:0%
we have a few of them in New Hampshire
 
02:52:13.670 --> 02:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
that don't have the the luxury of
 
02:52:16.490 --> 02:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
discharging to a receiving stream a
 
02:52:18.650 --> 02:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
river they may do a direct groundwater
 
02:52:20.990 --> 02:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
discharge through Rapid infiltration
 
02:52:23.809 --> 02:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
basins or some other such technology and
 
02:52:25.690 --> 02:52:25.700 align:start position:0%
in those cases the impact to that if
 
02:52:28.670 --> 02:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
effluent discharge has an immediate
 
02:52:30.830 --> 02:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
impact on groundwater quality and so for
 
02:52:32.870 --> 02:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
those types of facilities it's a much
 
02:52:35.809 --> 02:52:35.819 align:start position:0%
more difficult question so as with most
 
02:52:38.450 --> 02:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
things the the the best solution or even
 
02:52:41.030 --> 02:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
the need for a solution may be dependent
 
02:52:43.309 --> 02:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
on the particular wastes involved the
 
02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
particular facility and the
 
02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances are operating under so
 
02:52:48.889 --> 02:52:48.899 align:start position:0%
we're looking at all those we're working
 
02:52:50.690 --> 02:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
we're very close working relationships
 
02:52:52.730 --> 02:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
with all of our Wastewater plants and
 
02:52:54.170 --> 02:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
when they run into problems like that
 
02:52:56.510 --> 02:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're working to help them and actually
 
02:52:59.809 --> 02:52:59.819 align:start position:0%
the the pilot study that um Jamie
 
02:53:01.790 --> 02:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned is actually focused on one of
 
02:53:03.230 --> 02:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
those plants that has a rapid
 
02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
infiltration Basin to try to help them
 
02:53:07.370 --> 02:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
kind of get their arms around the
 
02:53:07.380 --> 02:53:09.830 align:start position:0%
kind of get their arms around the
problem

02:53:09.830 --> 02:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.809 --> 02:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
are there any further yes uh
 
02:53:13.730 --> 02:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
representative leishman all right thank
 
02:53:16.010 --> 02:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um is your name
 
02:53:18.530 --> 02:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
representative Leachman oh I'm sorry it
 
02:53:22.070 --> 02:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
could be he would like it to be oh I
 
02:53:24.769 --> 02:53:24.779 align:start position:0%
pass his cards out at the bar
 
02:53:29.030 --> 02:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:32.929 --> 02:53:32.939 align:start position:0%
oh I'm I'm so sorry I uh okay so on page
 
02:53:35.650 --> 02:53:35.660 align:start position:0%
15 you have uh
 
02:53:41.330 --> 02:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
several treatments in in health care uh
 
02:53:43.849 --> 02:53:43.859 align:start position:0%
prior to worrying about treatments we
 
02:53:45.769 --> 02:53:45.779 align:start position:0%
build in a whole preventive medicine
 
02:53:48.590 --> 02:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
prevention program and I'm just curious
 
02:53:51.530 --> 02:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
if if there's also a prevention aspect
 
02:53:54.170 --> 02:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
of this that that you guys are including
 
02:53:55.910 --> 02:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
in your thinking but is not in this
 
02:53:55.920 --> 02:53:57.410 align:start position:0%
in your thinking but is not in this
report

02:53:57.410 --> 02:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:53:59.269 --> 02:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you represent that's a great
 
02:54:01.070 --> 02:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
question and and yes the answer that is
 
02:54:03.170 --> 02:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
yes on both a state scale and a national
 
02:54:05.570 --> 02:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
scale so on the state scale
 
02:54:07.910 --> 02:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
um when now as I said we have close
 
02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
working relationships so it's in our
 
02:54:11.210 --> 02:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
Water Division and these Wastewater
 
02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
plants when they start and we've been
 
02:54:15.230 --> 02:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
and we've been doing at the state level
 
02:54:18.290 --> 02:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
in to assist them a lot of testing to
 
02:54:19.910 --> 02:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
understand what they're getting in for
 
02:54:22.550 --> 02:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
influent concentrations of pfas as well
 
02:54:24.410 --> 02:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
as what they're discharging out you know
 
02:54:27.410 --> 02:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
for treated effluent and when they find
 
02:54:29.750 --> 02:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
a problem that seems anomalous when they
 
02:54:32.210 --> 02:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
see concentrations that are particularly
 
02:54:33.830 --> 02:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
High some plants have even gone to the
 
02:54:35.570 --> 02:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
trouble of going and it helps you
 
02:54:37.370 --> 02:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
understand things better going to
 
02:54:39.530 --> 02:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
different locations in their collection
 
02:54:42.710 --> 02:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
system to try to find out if we are
 
02:54:44.330 --> 02:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
getting increased pfas where is it
 
02:54:46.610 --> 02:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
coming from and can they tie it to a
 
02:54:48.290 --> 02:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
particular commercial or industrial
 
02:54:50.630 --> 02:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
facility that may be using pfas
 
02:54:52.250 --> 02:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
containing materials in their
 
02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing processes and then ending
 
02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
up discharging them in their Wastewater
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of work that's been
 
02:55:01.429 --> 02:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
done to identify that and then that's
 
02:55:03.410 --> 02:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
when you get to the prevention piece if
 
02:55:06.110 --> 02:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
there's a a problem if that facility can
 
02:55:07.550 --> 02:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
use another material that doesn't use
 
02:55:09.290 --> 02:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
pfast to get it out that's a great
 
02:55:11.690 --> 02:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
solution if they have to use it for
 
02:55:13.790 --> 02:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
their particular manufacturing then they
 
02:55:16.670 --> 02:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
can look at removing that pfas prior to
 
02:55:19.309 --> 02:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
just getting into their Wastewater and
 
02:55:21.530 --> 02:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
discharging to the Wastewater system so
 
02:55:23.450 --> 02:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the state level and and
 
02:55:26.050 --> 02:55:26.060 align:start position:0%
local level prevention that we work on
 
02:55:28.429 --> 02:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
also there's a lot of discussion
 
02:55:30.830 --> 02:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
nationally that at the end of the day if
 
02:55:32.450 --> 02:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
we're going to solve this pfas problem
 
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
we kind of have to significantly
 
02:55:36.370 --> 02:55:36.380 align:start position:0%
absolutely have to significantly reduce
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
the presence of pfas and commerce that
 
02:55:40.969 --> 02:55:40.979 align:start position:0%
means that there's probably a lot of
 
02:55:43.370 --> 02:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
uses for these materials while while
 
02:55:45.469 --> 02:55:45.479 align:start position:0%
helpful and convenient may not be
 
02:55:48.170 --> 02:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
entirely necessary and when you run you
 
02:55:50.269 --> 02:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
know cost-benefit analysis of you know
 
02:55:51.830 --> 02:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
the benefit that that product gives you
 
02:55:55.849 --> 02:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
by using pfas versus the cost associated
 
02:55:58.670 --> 02:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
with managing wastes or the waste itself
 
02:56:01.309 --> 02:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
when you throw away that product those
 
02:56:02.750 --> 02:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
are those there's a lot of work going on
 
02:56:05.330 --> 02:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
there trying to really reduce the amount
 
02:56:07.730 --> 02:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
of pfas that's used and Industry is
 
02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
already making steps there they have
 
02:56:12.170 --> 02:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
lots of reasons not to be famous for
 
02:56:14.210 --> 02:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
having pfast in their products so
 
02:56:16.370 --> 02:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work going on to try to
 
02:56:18.889 --> 02:56:18.899 align:start position:0%
reduce or eliminate the use of pfas in
 
02:56:22.309 --> 02:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:25.849 --> 02:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so as I'm looking at the
 
02:56:29.030 --> 02:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
Alternatives I assume that one of the
 
02:56:31.490 --> 02:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
big factors is not only just the
 
02:56:34.130 --> 02:56:34.140 align:start position:0%
efficiency the effectiveness of these
 
02:56:37.490 --> 02:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
techniques but uh but also the energy
 
02:56:40.130 --> 02:56:40.140 align:start position:0%
consumption yes I I would assume that
 
02:56:42.830 --> 02:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
some of these are energy Hogs more than
 
02:56:46.610 --> 02:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
others and so so that's all part of your
 
02:56:49.250 --> 02:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
analysis I I presume that is correct
 
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's as with most things there's
 
02:56:53.210 --> 02:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
never a perfect sort of Silver Bullet
 
02:56:55.969 --> 02:56:55.979 align:start position:0%
everything has pros and cons and again
 
02:56:58.190 --> 02:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
the the answer for one facility may be
 
02:56:59.690 --> 02:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
very different than another you know if
 
02:57:01.610 --> 02:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
you're treating drinking water and
 
02:57:04.010 --> 02:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
you're a small facility or even a large
 
02:57:05.870 --> 02:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
facility granulated activated carbon
 
02:57:08.530 --> 02:57:08.540 align:start position:0%
turns out to be a very time tested
 
02:57:10.849 --> 02:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
effective and caught and though
 
02:57:13.370 --> 02:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
expensive still a cost-effective means
 
02:57:15.650 --> 02:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
of treating drinking water as Jamie
 
02:57:16.849 --> 02:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
mentioned when you start talking about
 
02:57:19.010 --> 02:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
treating leachate it gets more difficult
 
02:57:20.630 --> 02:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
you got to do a lot more pre-treatment
 
02:57:23.510 --> 02:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
and in fact uh Senator gray mentioned
 
02:57:26.389 --> 02:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
the turnkey landfill in Rochester the
 
02:57:27.889 --> 02:57:27.899 align:start position:0%
work that they did to remove nitrate
 
02:57:30.230 --> 02:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
that goes back to the 90s the treatment
 
02:57:32.450 --> 02:57:32.460 align:start position:0%
train they developed there for many
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
years has had a series of steps which is
 
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
which is which ends with a reverse
 
02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
osmosis step which you couldn't do on
 
02:57:42.050 --> 02:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
untreated leachate but but they once
 
02:57:43.370 --> 02:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
they've treated pre-treated it
 
02:57:46.010 --> 02:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
sufficiently they can do that they had
 
02:57:47.750 --> 02:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
no way of necessarily knowing it but
 
02:57:49.250 --> 02:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
even when we weren't paying attention we
 
02:57:51.710 --> 02:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
didn't know much about pfas their pre
 
02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
their treatment through the reverse
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
osmosis process was removing pfas so the
 
02:57:59.090 --> 02:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
the effluent that they were sending or
 
02:58:01.250 --> 02:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
the treated pre-treated leachate that
 
02:58:03.170 --> 02:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
they were sending to the Rochester City
 
02:58:05.630 --> 02:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant had largely had the
 
02:58:11.510 --> 02:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
represent representative Leachman thanks
 
02:58:15.530 --> 02:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
02:58:19.190 --> 02:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh Mike I'm sure the chairman is correct
 
02:58:21.710 --> 02:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
as far as this is becoming an explosive
 
02:58:24.349 --> 02:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
situation but is the department looking
 
02:58:27.410 --> 02:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
at additional sources of funding to help
 
02:58:29.630 --> 02:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
correct or do you plan to ask for
 
02:58:32.030 --> 02:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
additional funding in the next budget to
 
02:58:33.650 --> 02:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
address this issue
 
02:58:36.650 --> 02:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
well as you can imagine we have we have
 
02:58:38.750 --> 02:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of things going on with pfas and
 
02:58:41.570 --> 02:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
over time funding has been provided to
 
02:58:44.150 --> 02:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
the to the agency through some general
 
02:58:44.160 --> 02:58:45.790 align:start position:0%
the to the agency through some general
fund

02:58:45.790 --> 02:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:58:48.349 --> 02:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to help particularly
 
02:58:50.690 --> 02:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
drinking water plants put on treatment
 
02:58:52.130 --> 02:58:52.140 align:start position:0%
there's been a fair amount of
 
02:58:53.570 --> 02:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
significant amount of federal money
 
02:58:55.570 --> 02:58:55.580 align:start position:0%
that's been made available for that
 
02:58:58.450 --> 02:58:58.460 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
02:59:00.410 --> 02:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
access to the drinking one and
 
02:59:02.210 --> 02:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund which is provided
 
02:59:06.650 --> 02:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
in a number of cases some funding for a
 
02:59:09.410 --> 02:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
variety of both research and treatment
 
02:59:12.230 --> 02:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
processes are projects we've done some
 
02:59:14.450 --> 02:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
research we need to really understand
 
02:59:16.730 --> 02:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
where we have pfas and soils where we
 
02:59:18.830 --> 02:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
have pfas where does it occur in
 
02:59:20.450 --> 02:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
groundwater and drinking water in the
 
02:59:22.370 --> 02:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
states so we've used some funding to do
 
02:59:26.210 --> 02:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
those studies and we've also our primary
 
02:59:27.830 --> 02:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
focus is to be make sure that people
 
02:59:30.590 --> 02:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
aren't drinking contaminated water so
 
02:59:32.150 --> 02:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
much of the work we've done and the
 
02:59:34.250 --> 02:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
monies that we've spent have been on a
 
02:59:35.570 --> 02:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
combination of testing to understand
 
02:59:37.309 --> 02:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
where we have it occurring in drinking
 
02:59:39.050 --> 02:59:39.060 align:start position:0%
water and then making sure we get
 
02:59:42.170 --> 02:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
funding to both community and Municipal
 
02:59:44.870 --> 02:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
Water Systems to get treatment on so
 
02:59:47.630 --> 02:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
that they can serve Clean safe water so
 
02:59:49.309 --> 02:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
the the short answer to that is yes we
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
continue to seek funding and and and
 
02:59:54.710 --> 02:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
work with this specific issue
 
02:59:57.050 --> 02:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
um you know I think as you may have
 
03:00:00.290 --> 03:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
surmised from Jamie's presentation
 
03:00:00.300 --> 03:00:01.070 align:start position:0%
surmised from Jamie's presentation
um

03:00:01.070 --> 03:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:04.250 --> 03:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
in some respects this issue is is that
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
the market is sort of driving a lot of
 
03:00:07.309 --> 03:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
it we're doing a lot of the work that
 
03:00:08.750 --> 03:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
we've described here to work with our
 
03:00:10.849 --> 03:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
Wastewater plants understand where the
 
03:00:13.309 --> 03:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
problem is and how to solve it but in
 
03:00:13.319 --> 03:00:14.150 align:start position:0%
problem is and how to solve it but in
fact

03:00:14.150 --> 03:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
fact
 
03:00:17.330 --> 03:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
um the the landfills and the Wastewater
 
03:00:19.969 --> 03:00:19.979 align:start position:0%
plants together have a lot of incentive
 
03:00:21.769 --> 03:00:21.779 align:start position:0%
to try to get this out of their systems
 
03:00:25.550 --> 03:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
so as you as as was presented uh by
 
03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
Jamie you know the turnkey landfill
 
03:00:29.030 --> 03:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
which is the biggest operating landfill
 
03:00:31.010 --> 03:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
in the state has already been doing work
 
03:00:33.830 --> 03:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
to to Really develop pretty Advanced
 
03:00:36.889 --> 03:00:36.899 align:start position:0%
procedures for pre-treating leachate
 
03:00:40.070 --> 03:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and the Wastewater plants help to
 
03:00:41.870 --> 03:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
drive that because if at some point a
 
03:00:43.730 --> 03:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant decides we don't want
 
03:00:45.170 --> 03:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
to take your leachate anymore because we
 
03:00:46.910 --> 03:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
don't think we want to have to worry
 
03:00:49.070 --> 03:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
about it in our treated effluent that
 
03:00:50.690 --> 03:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
comes back to the landfill to find a
 
03:00:52.969 --> 03:00:52.979 align:start position:0%
solution so one of the things that I
 
03:00:56.410 --> 03:00:56.420 align:start position:0%
think we may look to do is
 
03:00:58.730 --> 03:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
have further discussions with the
 
03:00:59.929 --> 03:00:59.939 align:start position:0%
landfills and with the Wastewater
 
03:01:02.570 --> 03:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
Community to under understand whether a
 
03:01:04.990 --> 03:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
and Jamie touched on this whether a
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
regional pre-treatment facility would be
 
03:01:12.110 --> 03:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
an effective and a cost-effective means
 
03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:13.790 align:start position:0%
an effective and a cost-effective means
of

03:01:13.790 --> 03:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:01:15.710 --> 03:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
improving the quality of leachate that
 
03:01:17.570 --> 03:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
eventually gets delivered to these
 
03:01:19.070 --> 03:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
Wastewater plants for treatment and
 
03:01:21.290 --> 03:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
Disposal so there's a there's a lot
 
03:01:23.510 --> 03:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
going on there and and we still have yet
 
03:01:25.969 --> 03:01:25.979 align:start position:0%
a lot of work to do and a lot to learn
 
03:01:29.330 --> 03:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks Madam chair
 
03:01:32.690 --> 03:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Bradley reminded us that uh
 
03:01:36.070 --> 03:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
they they were just given 25 million in
 
03:01:39.830 --> 03:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
pfas remediation money but
 
03:01:42.230 --> 03:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not whether or not any of
 
03:01:44.210 --> 03:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
that will go to the Wastewater side I
 
03:01:47.750 --> 03:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't know but uh it is a it's a it's an
 
03:01:50.750 --> 03:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
issue that needs needs a lot of thought
 
03:01:53.929 --> 03:01:53.939 align:start position:0%
and I truly appreciate it Mr winstat for
 
03:01:53.939 --> 03:01:55.429 align:start position:0%
and I truly appreciate it Mr winstat for
your

03:01:55.429 --> 03:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:01:59.269 --> 03:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
presentation and uh and your concern
 
03:02:01.070 --> 03:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's our pleasure thank you and if there
 
03:02:03.110 --> 03:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
are follow-up questions about Jamie and
 
03:02:04.969 --> 03:02:04.979 align:start position:0%
I are happy to feel them uh just feel
 
03:02:06.349 --> 03:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
