i was originally born in houston texas
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%

so i asked this committee to uh embrace
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
that impact
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
i i may uh i may be off the radar for a
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
week or two when that happens so
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
bear with me if you guys are wondering
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
it is a girl
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
i uh my professional background i went
 
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
to suffolk university
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh i graduated in 2006 i then went to
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
immediately went to suffolk university
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
law school i
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
graduated in 2009 i've been practicing
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
law for over 10 years now
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm a partner at a law firm and
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming majority of my work is
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
out of state which is a really good
 
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:50.949 align:start position:0%
out of state which is a really good
thing

00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
i prefer not to litigation can be very
 
00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:55.430 align:start position:0%
i prefer not to litigation can be very
uh

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
combative so it's actually somewhat of a
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
belief not to deal with that
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
in-state but i will say that
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
when i ran i actually when i decided to
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
run for a state rep this was the
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
committee i wanted to serve on so it's a
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
tremendous honor to sit on this
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
committee and to sit as the chairman of
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
i felt that with my background and
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
experience that i really could
 
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.949 align:start position:0%
experience that i really could
contribute

00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
contribute
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
to a lot of laws and bills and stuff
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
that comes before the community and the
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
people who served with me last year know
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
that i'll even offer advice on bills
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
that i don't support
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
i still offer ex you know hey this is
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
how this might play out
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
and i do that because i think it's good
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh public policy to really try to put
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
the best bill forward whether
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna vote for or not it's a
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
different story and that's
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
something that i always made a point i
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
also am the type that i
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
i understand that we're all members of
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
different political parties
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
but at the same time you know i
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
really i vote with the constitution
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
platform aside i feel that that's
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
really what you know guides me on what
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to do and
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
and this sometimes bills that i it was a
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
bill last year that i uh last term that
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
i really liked and i voted against it
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
because it was unconstitutional and just
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate but it was what it was
 
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.550 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate but it was what it was
so

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
that's me and anyone has any questions
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
everyone knows i'm very approachable
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
so we'll just go around the room uh next
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
the vice chairman david welch
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
oh good morning everyone this is my uh
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
18th room i've been around for a while
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
my background is i worked for at t in
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
north hanover mass
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
for 31 years i retired
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
in 1993 and i devoted full-time
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
to the legislature
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
i've had a good run this is likely to be
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
my last
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
term and i've been recently married
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
this is four years ago i was widowed
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
and i kind of give up but then i met a
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
girl that i grew up with
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
and she was she was a recent widow we
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
got together and everything was good
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the reasons why this is
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
likely to be my last term
 
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.230 align:start position:0%
likely to be my last term
but

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
well you know it's mainly because chris
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
truth sat in back of me for the last two
 
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.870 align:start position:0%
truth sat in back of me for the last two
years

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
and i and i and i wanted to hang out
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
with him basically
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
and john burt but john burt is really
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
upsetting me because he's
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
not really socially distancing because i
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
live in where and he lives in ghost town
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
i really think
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of these meetings he
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
should have to go to bedford but that's
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
my thought
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman mr chairman
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative dick marston just called
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
me and he said that he believes he is he
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't recognized on the roll call
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
and then also he doesn't think we can
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
see him which i am looking right at him
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
is in the committee and that he has been
 
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.070 align:start position:0%
is in the committee and that he has been
recognized

um the most vulnerable people that have
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
been affected by the criminal justice
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
system and
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
in my district um like sex workers
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
productive members of society and and
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
not punish them necessarily for
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
and how we're going to conduct the
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee i went through the list of all
 
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.550 align:start position:0%
committee i went through the list of all
the

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
bills that are lsrs and and bills that
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
are out there right now
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
this is unofficial but by my estimation
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to have about 50 to 60 bills
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
come before our committee
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's not take into consideration the
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
senate bills that will eventually come
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
our way
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh so we're going to have our work cut
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
out for us we're going to be on a very
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
tight schedule
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
now as you heard during the opening
 
00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:21.990 align:start position:0%
now as you heard during the opening
remarks

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
remarks
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
there will be members of the public that
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
are participating
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh remotely and it for what i understand
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's likely to remain that way at least
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
for the rest of this year
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
now there as you can tell there'll be
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
plenty of technical issues that come up
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure the official title
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
for this position but there will be two
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
people on the committee
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
that will help kind of be the liaison
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
of dealing with the technical issues
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
while we're in the committee meetings
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's important that the public has
 
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.069 align:start position:0%
it's important that the public has
access

00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
to these hearings if they don't if
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
we would have to stop the hearing also
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know members of the committee we may
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
have our own technical issues so
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
i know uh and i spoke with each of these
 
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.349 align:start position:0%
i know uh and i spoke with each of these
representatives

00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
beforehand representative david muse and
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative john burt
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
um they're not necessarily gonna be
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
working together on this issue but
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
either one of both of them will be kind
 
00:42:17.839 --> 00:42:18.710 align:start position:0%
either one of both of them will be kind
of

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
assisting the committee with any
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
technology issues we're having
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
communicating with the staff
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
beforehand my understanding there will
 
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
be some
 
00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.670 align:start position:0%
be some
[Music]

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
mild informal training i'm not again i'm
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
not sure what that's going to entail
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that you're familiar
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
with the software the staff
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
will still set up the hearings but it's
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
just critical that
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
if there is a technical difficulty
 
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.829 align:start position:0%
if there is a technical difficulty
myself

00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
the vice chair and the clerk we might be
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
oblivious to it
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
so i would ask that you know obviously
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
we all be conscious of especially
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
representative burt and representative
 
00:42:50.079 --> 00:42:50.710 align:start position:0%
representative burt and representative
museum

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
museum
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
i want to thank both of you both of you
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
representatives for
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
accepting that responsibility so
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
now we have uh deadlines coming up
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
for uh any bill that has a second
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
committee in february so we're gonna
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
really push through a lot of bills and i
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
this is not ideal for any of us but due
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
to the volume of bills and restraints
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we have any bills that require a
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know when i say require that is
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
really deserving of a subcommittee
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
will likely be end up having to be
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
retained and when i say that
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
i understand that's frustrating and it's
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
really not my personal preference
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
or i don't believe that's any of our
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
preferences but
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
i would hate to see a bill fail
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
simply because it didn't get the
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate work that it needed
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
also keep in mind that passing a bill in
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
the house is great
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
we got to go through the senate so there
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
may be some uh
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
better strategy approach to having some
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
of these bills
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
worked on over the summer time having
 
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
the executive session in the
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
fall and then voting on in the beginning
 
00:43:59.359 --> 00:44:00.069 align:start position:0%
fall and then voting on in the beginning
of

00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
2022. if we can avoid that that's great
 
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.230 align:start position:0%
2022. if we can avoid that that's great
but

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's just something i foresee being a
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
it won't be like last term or where we
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
had a if we had a bill
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
through a subcommittee all we would do
 
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.630 align:start position:0%
through a subcommittee all we would do
is

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
that uh the chairman would just create a
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and then within a week or
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
two would be done
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
we just may not have the luxury of doing
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
all these subcommittee meetings given
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
the limited zoom accounts we have
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
the limited uh options we have when we
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
can hold the hearings
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
so it is a work in progress and it's
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
just not going to be perfect that's a
 
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.150 align:start position:0%
just not going to be perfect that's a
reality

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh so because because of some of the
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
time constraints and this is not my
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
preference but it's just the reality and
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
we all need to adapt to any situation
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
that comes before us whether it's the
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
cover 19 pandemic
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
or any other issues to come in the
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
future that
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
we may be holding some executive
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
sessions the same day as the public
 
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.109 align:start position:0%
sessions the same day as the public
hearings

00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
and again that's not a preference but
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
it's really a matter of
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
we have to we want to make sure we meet
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
all our deadlines
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
because while we while we are meeting
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
today there's a limited amount of zoom
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
accounts available
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
for the committees i believe there's
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
only five so theoretically only five
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
committees can be holding a public
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
hearing at the same time
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
and i think we really got to be as
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
efficient as we can
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
with with our time and we got to
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
obviously use that time wisely also
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh for the the committee members who
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
choose to appear in person for the time
 
00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.550 align:start position:0%
choose to appear in person for the time
being

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
if we're at the lob my understanding is
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
going to open the
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
room up so we can spread out and
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
socially distance
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh but that would take up the room for
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
ways and means as well so while we are
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
meeting or holding a hearing our friends
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
in the ways and means committee
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
cannot meet uh for that matter so
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
they would have to find a different room
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately again
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
while we're meeting we want to again get
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
as much work as we
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
can guess much work done possible and i
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
think that that's
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
something we're going to have to do i
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that they would open up the
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
the rooms so we can space out more
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is is that they're
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
air filters or air scrubbers that
 
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:20.810 align:start position:0%
should recycle the air in the room
 
00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:21.990 align:start position:0%
should recycle the air in the room

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
up to five times per hour i'm not a uh
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not qualified to explain the science
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
behind that
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
i do know that i understand there'll be
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
some black light filteration
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh as well as um i believe hepa filters
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
but don't quote me on that
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
i more information that will come out
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
but that's something that will
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
obviously try to keep the room the air
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
clean and keep us safe
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
so one practice we may have to adopt
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
also not my preference but it may make
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
sense we may
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
hold multiple public hearings at the
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
same time
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
if the subject matter is very similar i
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
know that this
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
practice is often followed in the senate
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh going through the list of house bills
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
and lsrs
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
one i foresee we can do that with there
 
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
is a house bill on
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
recreational in regulation of cannabis
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
and then there's a
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
one involving home growing of cannabis i
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
would think that
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
those two bills could be heard in a
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
single hearing
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
we would still have a separate vote for
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
the executive session but
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
i recall both of those uh the bills of
 
00:47:31.839 --> 00:47:32.309 align:start position:0%
i recall both of those uh the bills of
last

00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
term being very time consuming uh
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony will overlap some
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
of the public policy will overlap so
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
i believe we would that may be something
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's an example when we would do that
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
so keep that in mind uh
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
just a couple of uh other preferences
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
if anyone has any questions you know
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
feel free to call me anytime i don't
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
care if it's a saturday sunday
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
if it's eight o'clock at night nine
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
o'clock at night uh
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
during the day if i'm busy and i can't
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
answer i won't answer
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
but don't feel it it's it's it's a
 
00:48:04.839 --> 00:48:06.150 align:start position:0%
but don't feel it it's it's it's a
bother

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
bother
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
if you can't reach me please
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh reach out to the vice chair
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative welch
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
as you know he's been a member of the
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
body for over 30 years he
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
obviously i have no problem with you
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
going and
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
bring any questions to him to make sure
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
whatever it is just do what we got to do
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
when i do see each of
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
each member and for the returning
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
members i'm gonna
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
give you another one i handed out pins
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
last year that i
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
i thought was really the mark of our
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
committee but also a symbol of
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
unity on our committee that doesn't
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
matter what party you are
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
you all have the same pin and it's
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's for members of the criminal
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
justice public safety committee only
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
i suppose if you hand it out to someone
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
else i i wouldn't take offense but i
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
that's what that's for so if you see me
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
please ask for it
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
there will be some uh there will be a
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
the 2020 uh shooting the 2021 edition of
 
00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:05.910 align:start position:0%
the 2020 uh shooting the 2021 edition of
the

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
rsas that are relevant to our committee
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
we are going to receive those
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
those books i know they're going to be
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
sent to the our
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
the the our committee office i'm not
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
entirely certain how many if we're going
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
to mail those to people's residence or
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do from there
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
if you wish to pick it up i just ask
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
that you contact karen let her know that
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
you'll pick it up
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh yourself and then
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
representative welch is going to talk
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
about some of the facilities that we're
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
going to hopefully
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
at some point be able to go on a tour of
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see that happening in the
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future but
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's something that's very important
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
because i know we get a lot of headlines
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis and and firearm bills and
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
that gets a lot of headline but we have
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of other responsibilities i mean
 
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.750 align:start position:0%
a lot of other responsibilities i mean
fireworks

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
fireworks
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
issues involving firefighters we're
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot of bills involving
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
and police reform but also the uh
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities the parole board
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of other responsibilities
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
that don't quite get the same press
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
but are still just as important to our
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
state and to our committee so
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative welch we'll do uh we'll
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
explain what some of those facilities
 
00:50:15.119 --> 00:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
explain what some of those facilities
are

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:18.430 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
all right there's four main
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
agencies that that we need to uh visit
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
when we
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
when we can top on the list is a state
 
00:50:32.079 --> 00:50:33.510 align:start position:0%
when we can top on the list is a state
prison

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
prison
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
we deal with a lot of stuff that put
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
people in prison
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
and sometimes we deal on things on bills
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
to help people get back
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
out state prison is
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
high on my list for for visitation
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
but given the current circumstances
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely we'll be able to do that
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
police centers and training police
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
that's why we train all the law
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement people and we also train the
 
00:51:07.119 --> 00:51:07.750 align:start position:0%
enforcement people and we also train the
corrections

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
officers so that is another area
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
again when we can we should visit that
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
the the fire academy the fire academy
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
now let's see the fire academy
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh is where we train the firefighters uh
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have many bills dealing with uh
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
firefighters but
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
occasionally we do but we also use that
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
we have the fireworks review committee
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
several other groups that do meet at the
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
fire academy
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
and say well we we paid for it with tax
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
dollars so it's something we should
 
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.790 align:start position:0%
dollars so it's something we should
visit

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
visit
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
the forensic lab dealing with
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
drugs uh we there's been some expansion
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
of the forensic lab we have a new
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
new person over there whose name i can't
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
remember right at the moment
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
but we should go to the forensic lab
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
those are the four top areas that we
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
need to visit
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle not so much
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh let's see
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
those are the four main ones that we
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
will visit at some point when we get the
 
00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.750 align:start position:0%
will visit at some point when we get the
opportunity

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
and and if we can go to those things
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's important that we go as a committee
 
00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:40.870 align:start position:0%
it's important that we go as a committee
so

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
everyone gets to see what everyone else
 
00:52:43.599 --> 00:52:45.109 align:start position:0%
everyone gets to see what everyone else
sees

00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
sees
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's basically it turn it back to the
 
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.910 align:start position:0%
that's basically it turn it back to the
chairman

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
i don't know whose dog that is because i
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
think all i think half of you have a dog
 
00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:57.589 align:start position:0%
think all i think half of you have a dog
but

00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you representative welsh
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
there's another topic i wanted to just
 
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.030 align:start position:0%
there's another topic i wanted to just
uh

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
there we go all right dive into
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
quickly while we're doing the remote
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
meetings as we are now if you
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
want to raise your hand and i can see
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
the video
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
obviously put your hand up and we'll
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
kind of go that route
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i'll call on you
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
all right if if your hands up and i
 
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:33.430 align:start position:0%
all right if if your hands up and i
don't

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
recognize it you know just keep waving
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
the more you wave the more
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
the more we'll see it and then obviously
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's helpful for myself and the clerk to
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to try to make it a point
 
00:53:45.839 --> 00:53:46.710 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to try to make it a point
to

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
go around for the people who aren't on
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
video if they're calling in
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
you know i don't if they have i would
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
prefer the obviously people to be on
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
video just like we see
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
see the person but at the same time i
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to tell if you're
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
waving so try to alert myself or the
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
the vice chair or the clerk that you're
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
in respect to some other issues i wanted
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
to cover
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
so regardless of of
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
what party you're affiliated with
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
the people who are on this community and
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
even some of the members of the house
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
that are returning but are on the
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
committee for the first time
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
they know that we work together as a
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
team we eat lunch together
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
we all sit together uh we had i think we
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
had a pretty good bond last year
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
we worked through some we had some
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
difficult things that came up
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i think we worked we worked through
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
it together as a committee and i think
 
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.109 align:start position:0%
it together as a committee and i think
it

00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
even though there was hurt feelings at
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
times i think often
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
we came out closer and better as a
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
result of that and
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
from my perspective i want to one make
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
it clear whatev
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
everyone has a clean slate we're
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
starting over with that so
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
i think we can work together and
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish some really good things
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
i i will say and it's my preference and
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
this is not a rule
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not a household it's not
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
a committee rule
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
that if there's ever any issue with
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
myself or any member of the committee
 
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
for that matter
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
that you have a concern with whether
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's their behavior
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's the rhetoric they use or
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
something they said
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
um all i all i would recommend
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
is that i felt feel that
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
if i had an issue with any member of
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
this committee that i could direct it to
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
that person directly
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
i i don't need to put it on social media
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
i would buy
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
and i'll just use um myself as an
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
example if you had an
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
issue with what i was doing i would say
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
feel free to address with me directly
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative gather i know i'm going
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
to use this example because
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
there was a incident last term where
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
representative gathright was not
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
particularly happy with my behavior uh
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
and we had a she has to speak with me
 
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.309 align:start position:0%
and we had a she has to speak with me
privately

00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
privately
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
she had a very a lot of powerful words
 
00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
and we but at the same time it was a
 
00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.190 align:start position:0%
and we but at the same time it was a
productive

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
productive
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
constructive conversation that two
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
professionals had
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
and although although i didn't agree
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
with everything she said
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
it didn't mean a lot to me that she was
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
one comfortable enough
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
to approach me and talk to me about an
 
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
issue she had
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
with me and we were able to work it out
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
and hear each other out it was never any
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
voices raised
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
despite how assertive she was and
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
confident she was she was right to the
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
point and i remember
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
i always said although i didn't agree
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
with everything she said her criticism
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
was fair
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
and and i appreciated that she brought
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
that to me it wasn't something that was
 
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
on twitter
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
or facebook or any of that and i would
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
just say that
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know when we if there is an issue
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
and i see it on twitter or facebook
 
00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.390 align:start position:0%
and i see it on twitter or facebook
first

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
i mean to me that it meant a lot to me
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
that she did that and
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
i think that i would just hope that you
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
all have that
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
that uh feeling because we're going to
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
work together on a lot of different
 
00:57:03.359 --> 00:57:04.150 align:start position:0%
work together on a lot of different
things

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
i see if you burn a bridge on one topic
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
it might that bridge may stay burned for
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
other topics and i think that that
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
pushes us further apart
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
so if and i'm telling you
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
and i expect everyone to if someone does
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
raise a concern you don't have to agree
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
with the concern
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
but give that member the respect of
 
00:57:24.839 --> 00:57:26.230 align:start position:0%
but give that member the respect of
explaining

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
explaining
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what you know what their concern
 
00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.230 align:start position:0%
exactly what you know what their concern
is

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
and and i think that will make us
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
actually bring us closer together not
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
push us further apart so
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
we have representative conley has joined
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
so does anyone have any questions about
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
what i just
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
that the issue i talked about with
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
addressing the committee with any
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and what i what i will
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
say is that
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
i looked at a lot of the bills that are
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
coming for our committee a lot of them
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
are bipartisan bills sponsored by
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
several members of this committee and
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
that's a very that was good to see
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
so that's that's something that we're
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
going to have as well uh
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative connolly we did briefly
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
go around and let everyone introduce
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
themselves to the committee
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
explain their professional background
 
00:58:31.119 --> 00:58:33.510 align:start position:0%
explain their professional background
and

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
any other background about their
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
themselves that they want to share with
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to share any information
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's like his audio isn't working his
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
he may not need to just um walk out with
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
this is why we have two two people in
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i have a question
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
if a member on the committee was
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
a sponsor or co-sponsor of a bill
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
if they did not testify they were
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to sit
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the chair and still ask questions but
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
if they testified
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
they could still sit in the chair but
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
they weren't you know their chair they
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
just weren't allowed to ask questions
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
how are you going to proceed with that
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
question what i will say is that if you
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
are the prime sponsor or co-sponsor of
 
00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:53.829 align:start position:0%
are the prime sponsor or co-sponsor of
any

00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
bill uh it's not gonna it's like in the
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee room where you can get up and
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
leave your seat
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
i would say that you are not it's not
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for you to ask
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
any questions during the public hearing
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
of any of the witnesses now
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
the other scenario that can happen and
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
is that even if you're not a sponsor or
 
01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.030 align:start position:0%
is that even if you're not a sponsor or
co-sponsor

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
you're still free to testify before the
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
committee as a member of the public
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's not common but it can happen i
 
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
actually did it last year
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh at the request of a representative a
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative who
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
wanted me to present to the committee
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
thought i would do a better job
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
so i did that for him even though i
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
didn't support the bill
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
but i did it anyway as a because i gave
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
him my word that i would i
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
will consider myself removed from the
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
committee for the purposes of that
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
so either way you would not be permitted
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
to ask any questions
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh if it's a bill that
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the executive session
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
you are still allowed to participate
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
as you know regardless of uh
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
because the public hearing's closed so
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
you can then vote on the bill as a
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman can you clarify when you
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
say you consider yourself removed from
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
the committee for the hearing do you
 
01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.349 align:start position:0%
the committee for the hearing do you
mean

01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
um you can't sit in your chair let's you
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
know imagine
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's no covet and we're in the lobby
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
are you saying you wouldn't be able to
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
sit in your chair
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
as a committee member
 
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
it it's the preference that you not sit
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
in the chair
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
just it's again it's the perception of
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
you sitting there even though you didn't
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
ask any questions you still look like it
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
still gives the perception that you're
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
participating in the hearing
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
we all may understand that you're not
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
but from the public's perspective
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh i it is my preference that you sit in
 
01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:43.109 align:start position:0%
uh i it is my preference that you sit in
the

01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
audience while you do that i know when i
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
did that when i
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
testified last year on a real before
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
committee that same one i was referring
 
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.349 align:start position:0%
committee that same one i was referring
to

01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
the room we had the double room and the
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
room was full there was actually nowhere
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
to stand or sit so i
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
kind of snuck back to my chair but i
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
pushed my chair as far back as i can
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
just to not give the perception i was
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
sitting at the table
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
but while we're doing these remotely
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's not really
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh a way for you i'm not asking you to
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
turn yours your camera off right and
 
01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.510 align:start position:0%
turn yours your camera off right and
that's

01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's going to matter in
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
that sense but just refrain from asking
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
any questions of the witnesses
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's how it would work
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
and that's solution not
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
not a it hasn't been really
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
too much of a problem in this committee
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
but something to be aware of
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
another time another time constraint
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
issue i
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
and uh this may not be the case every
 
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.349 align:start position:0%
and uh this may not be the case every
time

01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
but we may limit the time of testimony
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
for all the bills again just just to
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
make sure we can get through everything
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
um i anticipate that being three minutes
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh depending on the the uh
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
length of the bill we may allow an
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
exception uh
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
for the prime sponsor or the person
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
who's presenting the bill to the
 
01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.589 align:start position:0%
who's presenting the bill to the
committee

01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
to perhaps have maybe up to five minutes
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh i'm more concerned about right
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
now about
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
the calendar of whom we're going to be
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
working you say we have 50
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
60 bills are we going to have a
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
particular day
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
or half a day which we are be
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
hearing bills and
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
is it are we going to do them as a clump
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bourdain it it
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
is it's depend on the bill i
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
i mentioned earlier that the
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis and the home
 
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:43.829 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis and the home
growing

01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
of cannabis those may be done kind of as
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
a one hearing kind of lump close
 
01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:50.309 align:start position:0%
a one hearing kind of lump close
together

01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
i just anticipate that being a very long
 
01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.349 align:start position:0%
i just anticipate that being a very long
hearing

01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
so we put those together some of the
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
bills uh
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know if we want to talk about issues
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
involving law enforcement although it
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
covers the same subject matter
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're very very different issues so i
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't really see a lot of those being
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
grouped together and that's also very uh
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
it's more of a
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
very specific issues raised by each bill
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it would be
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh it might be much more difficult to do
 
01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.069 align:start position:0%
uh it might be much more difficult to do
that

01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
with those type of bills so when we say
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
clump them together though
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
i would anticipate and ask everyone to
 
01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.430 align:start position:0%
i would anticipate and ask everyone to
plan

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
that if we have a public hearing on a
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
bill at least anticipate that we may
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
have the executive session
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
that same day and again that's
 
01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.390 align:start position:0%
that same day and again that's
unfortunately

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
due to the time constraints and so when
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
when a bill is noticed in the calendar
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to ask to be noticed that
 
01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.109 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to ask to be noticed that
it

01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
for an executive session as well just so
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
try to get through everything and
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
obviously if if it's the bill's not
 
01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.190 align:start position:0%
obviously if if it's the bill's not
ready

01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
to uh to go forward on that you know
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
again we have the time constraint so i
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid that if we don't
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
keep it moving we may lose it so the
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
other option is we always can
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
retain the bills and work on over the
 
01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.470 align:start position:0%
retain the bills and work on over the
summertime

01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
summertime
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
so when i say clump i was talking about
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
not assigning particular
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh starting times for a set of bills
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
because as we saw in some
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
hearings last year they the bills took
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes five to ten minutes instead of
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
a half hour that was allocated to her
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
and also are we going to have a day of
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
the week in which we
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
are going to be hearing bills because i
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
need to sort of know what my calendar
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
in regards to scheduling it's my
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
understanding that at some
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
very shortly i will know there'll be
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
specific days
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
that we will be allowed to meet you know
 
01:05:45.039 --> 01:05:46.549 align:start position:0%
that we will be allowed to meet you know
hypothetically

01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
hypothetically
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
mondays and wednesdays may be days that
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
meet so i don't have the specific days
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
but it should be relatively consistent
 
01:05:56.079 --> 01:05:56.789 align:start position:0%
but it should be relatively consistent
uh

01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
where once we know those days i'll be
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
sure the whole committee is made aware
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
when it comes clubbing them together
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to notice them very
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
close in time to each other
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
and myself and representative wells are
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
going to sit down and try to
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
kind of try to master the schedule here
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate how long we anticipate the
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
hearings will take
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
we don't want to uh be in a situation
 
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.190 align:start position:0%
we don't want to uh be in a situation
where

01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
we're sitting around for a half hour
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
because of the way we notice the time
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh i will notice maybe the other option
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
is you may notice
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
four or five bills at nine o'clock in
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
the morning four or five deals at ten
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
just to kind of spread it out so people
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
have an idea when their bill will be
 
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.589 align:start position:0%
have an idea when their bill will be
recalled

01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
recalled
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
but again it's in order for us to keep
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
this moving we don't want to
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
have to sit around even 15-20 minutes
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
lost we can get through a public hearing
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
in that time i think it's
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh it would be unfortunate for us not to
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
we voted on a rule uh over at the
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
drive-in activity at unh
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
regarding lobbyists and whether they
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
would testify before
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
or after and i think they left it up to
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
the chairman
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
to decide you know which way they're
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
going to do it
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
what is your preference to
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
letting lobbyists testify before the
 
01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:31.589 align:start position:0%
letting lobbyists testify before the
citizens

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
so my my respect to that
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
rule and i think when we passed it
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
two years ago the only reason why i
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
didn't support it is that i thought
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
that the chairman of the committee
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
should have the discretion to conduct
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
the hearing as they saw appropriate as
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
because every hearing is going to be
 
01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.230 align:start position:0%
because every hearing is going to be
different

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
it is my personal preference that
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
members of the public
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
testify before lobbyists however
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
if there is a lobbyist here that's on a
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
time constraint
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know as a professional courtesy
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes you may show
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's an option to show them a
 
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
preference but
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
in this term particularly we're all on a
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
time constraint so
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
we're all going to be trying to work
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
together quite often
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
members of the public also other
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
representatives have
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
multiple bills going before multiple
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
committees and may have
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
multiple hearings they have to go
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
through go testify
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
in front of so if someone comes to me
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
saying i have a 10 o'clock
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
in fro in the finance committee and
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
i have a 9 30 in criminal justice
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
if whether that's a private individual
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
or a lobbyist or a representative
 
01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.309 align:start position:0%
or a lobbyist or a representative
whoever

01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
whoever
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
i would try to accommodate that just to
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're able to to
 
01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:43.910 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're able to to
testify

01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
especially if it's brought to my
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
attention in advance but generally
 
01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:47.510 align:start position:0%
attention in advance but generally
speaking

01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
it's my preference that members of the
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
public testify first but
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
again we're dealing because while we're
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
dealing in these difficult times
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want anyone to miss anything so
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative welch
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
yes in ordinary circumstances this is
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
before colburn
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh the sponsors would speak first
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
give you the impression of the bill and
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist sometimes can give you a lot
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking they are paid and
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
they'll sit there
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
and they'll wait until everybody else is
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
through and then they'll come up and
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
pass in a pink card
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
i think you're going to have to learn
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
which lobbyists do that
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
and kind of let them know
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
where they stand in in the pecking order
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
also for people testifying if we're
 
01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:41.510 align:start position:0%
also for people testifying if we're
testifying

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
again pre-colburn and you have people
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
that come from the
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
say up around errol or berlin
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of distance to travel
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
and when you get to the public you
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
should take those that travel the
 
01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.390 align:start position:0%
should take those that travel the
farthest

01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
farthest
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
first it's just just a thought
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wells and and
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why i think
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
having that it'd be somewhat
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
discretionary is important because this
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
different circumstances for every
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
witness and you would hate to see
 
01:10:13.199 --> 01:10:14.550 align:start position:0%
witness and you would hate to see
someone

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
swapped in line or because because of
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
ray handcuffed by a rule but at the same
 
01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:19.510 align:start position:0%
ray handcuffed by a rule but at the same
time

01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
i agree with what representative walsh
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
is saying if someone has a two-hour
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
drive or commute i think that's relevant
 
01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:26.229 align:start position:0%
drive or commute i think that's relevant
and

01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
for anyone in the audience to just
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
listen to us talk you know
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
please submit your cards right away and
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
if in
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's submit your card and if you want to
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
wave off that's fine
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
but we also want to try to gauge how
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
much how long the hearing
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
may take so we think if there's only
 
01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:42.630 align:start position:0%
may take so we think if there's only
three

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
cards handed in and we think it's gonna
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
be done relatively soon then we get two
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
three more cards
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
the master schedule that representative
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
welch and i are gonna try to put
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
together will be
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
disrupted by that so it would be better
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
for us to know if everyone handed the
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
cards in
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
earlier there's no rule saying you have
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
to do that but that would be
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
preferred representative marston
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for recognizing me
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh i don't want to go trip back to uh
 
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
john burt's question
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
and put in some words and get some feel
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
for what we're talking about
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
if you have a bill and you present it to
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
you're then going to turn around and
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
restrict my rights for
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
free speech that i don't get to ask
 
01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.750 align:start position:0%
free speech that i don't get to ask
questions

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
if somebody testifies and they testify
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
negatively about my bill i don't get the
 
01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:38.950 align:start position:0%
negatively about my bill i don't get the
question

01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
their motives or i don't get the
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
question why they're doing what they're
 
01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:43.750 align:start position:0%
question why they're doing what they're
doing

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
i am then stymied i don't understand
 
01:11:47.199 --> 01:11:47.590 align:start position:0%
i am then stymied i don't understand
that

01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
and is that a rule or is that a courtesy
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for the thank you for
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
the question so
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
that was first of all that was the
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
practice of the committee my
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
that that is a rule that has been
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
followed by
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
the committees uh it was followed last
 
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.510 align:start position:0%
the committees uh it was followed last
year

01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
and i i think again it's i don't believe
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's a restriction on your speech
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
because i
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
assure every member of this committee
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
you will have your opportunity to speak
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
and if you're if you are the prime
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor and you present the bill
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
and a witness says something that you
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
would like to respond to
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
i i'm not going to make any promises
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
because i already explained that i'm
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
going to limit testimony
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
but for example if you're the prime
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor for bill and
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
about your um allotted five minutes of
 
01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.310 align:start position:0%
about your um allotted five minutes of
testimony

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
you can reserve your time and i could
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
call you again
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
so maybe if you opened with three
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
minutes i would reserve
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
again if you're allowed up to five
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
minutes i would love i would maybe
 
01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.070 align:start position:0%
minutes i would love i would maybe
consider

01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
that as an option to respond to certain
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh points people made but also remember
 
01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:56.870 align:start position:0%
uh points people made but also remember
that

01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
during the executive session if anyone
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
says anything that's
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
you believe to be inaccurate or
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
misleading or you just disagree with
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
during the executive session you have
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to say
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
and address those that testimony as well
 
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
so that's something to point out and
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
also if you are going to be testifying
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
on a bill or and you're the prime
 
01:13:20.239 --> 01:13:21.350 align:start position:0%
on a bill or and you're the prime
sponsor

01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
the other members of the committee or
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
your committee know that you may
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
not be able to ask the question so keep
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
in mind which trust each other to have
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
each other's
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh backs on that that knowing that
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
someone may not be able to ask a
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
question but if they
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
have a particular question i think we
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
should offer everyone that courtesy
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative welch yeah to respond to
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative marston if you're a
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
member of the committee and you're a
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor or even a co-sponsor of a
 
01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:50.550 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor or even a co-sponsor of a
bill

01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
and you feel the need to to correct
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
something that's been said
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's what the executive session is for
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
executive session is kind of free
 
01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.550 align:start position:0%
executive session is kind of free
wheeling

01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
wheeling
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
you you will not be restricted in an
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is the rule is we do
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
not debate
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
a witness we only ask questions to draw
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
out the information that we need to make
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
a decision on the bill
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
and sometimes sometimes we lose track of
 
01:14:17.199 --> 01:14:17.590 align:start position:0%
and sometimes sometimes we lose track of
that

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
so that's up to the chairman to
 
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.350 align:start position:0%
so that's up to the chairman to
recognize

01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
you don't debate a witness you'll you
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
will have your day in
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%

01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh my first four
 
01:15:18.239 --> 01:15:19.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh my first four
terms

01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
terms
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the house two of the first terms
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
that i was you know on criminal justice
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
i believe under uh chairman welch and
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
also under
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thall we allowed the
 
01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.189 align:start position:0%
chairman thall we allowed the
co-sponsors

01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
as long as they did not speak on the
 
01:15:41.679 --> 01:15:42.870 align:start position:0%
as long as they did not speak on the
bill

01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
we allowed them to participate in the
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
committee and ask
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
questions now if they were if they were
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
yes i understand that you get
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
one you know you have to speak on the
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
bill so you don't get to sit and ask all
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
but if you want to not speak
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
in front of the committee as a
 
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.470 align:start position:0%
in front of the committee as a
co-sponsor

01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
then you have the right in the first
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
four terms that i was there
 
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
under chairman cushing he was the one
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
that changed that
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
in my fifth term and said no you know if
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
you're a co-sponsor or any sponsor or
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
anything like that you can't speak
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
but my first four terms we were allowed
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
to speak and
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
again it was under chairman tall and
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative bur what i will do is i
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
will consult with
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
with the clerk on this my understanding
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
the rule is that if you're the sponsor
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
of a bill
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
then you should not be questioning
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
the way any of the witnesses now uh what
 
01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:42.790 align:start position:0%
the way any of the witnesses now uh what
i

01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
also recommend to people is that is the
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
rule and i am correct with that rule
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
then maybe be selective on how you
 
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor bills coming for the committee i
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
know when i would ask the co-sponsor of
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of bills that came before the
 
01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:56.390 align:start position:0%
a lot of bills that came before the
committee

01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
part of my concern was if i co-sponsor
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
all these bills to come before the
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
committee how could i serve as the
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
chairman of the committee because i
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
won't be be able to participate in
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
any of the hearings now with that being
 
01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.270 align:start position:0%
any of the hearings now with that being
said

01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
what i will do is i i will at least
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
discuss your concern with the clerk to
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
get some clarification on that but
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
i think it's important just the
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
perception of the public again to make
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
it does not look like there's any
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
conflicts amongst any of the
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
representatives sitting on the committee
 
01:17:26.719 --> 01:17:27.510 align:start position:0%
representatives sitting on the committee
so

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
i i will look into that further without
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
my unders that was my understanding of
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
and i i respect what you're saying so
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
i'll be sure to look into that
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
sorry and mr chairman one final thing
 
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
is is make sure when you speak to the
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
clerk if you don't mind a
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
distinct between the difference sponsor
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
which i understand and co-sponsor
 
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.430 align:start position:0%
which i understand and co-sponsor
because

01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
i have co-sponsored a few bills that i
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to go back to the
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
old rules so my name's on it
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
but in the committee if it does come to
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
our committee i do want to
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
participate and in the past it always
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
was allowed until
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i'll be sure to
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
distinguish the two because i understand
 
01:18:14.719 --> 01:18:15.669 align:start position:0%
distinguish the two because i understand
the

01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes i had some questions just about the
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
in-person meetings
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
and some of the requirements for folks
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
who are going to be attending so one of
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
the things i'm curious about
 
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
is whether or not legislators who are
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
going to be attending
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh committee meetings in person are
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
going to be required to wear masks
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
the other question that i have is for
 
01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:40.709 align:start position:0%
the other question that i have is for
legislators

01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh who are attending in person what
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
steps are being taken to make sure
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
that uh they are miked properly so that
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
members of the public who are attending
 
01:18:51.199 --> 01:18:52.630 align:start position:0%
members of the public who are attending
remotely

01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
as well as any legislators who might be
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
attending remotely
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh can actually hear what's going on in
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
the meeting
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
so in regards to the whether people are
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
miked properly that's
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
part of the role of having more than one
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
tech person to make sure that
 
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
you can be heard i think it would make
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
sense to do a mic check or a sound check
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
before we start just to make sure
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
we can all be heard i don't know exactly
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
where different microphones will be set
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
up in the room
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
so i i can't answer that definitively
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
so i do know that i can imagine there'll
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
be more than one
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
just because we're going to be spread
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
out ourselves in the room
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
at least six feet apart so i think
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
having one microphone wouldn't really
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
work so i i can imagine it'll be a few
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
will where they'll be set up i'm not
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
sure if they'll be individual
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
microphones or whatnot i know last term
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
we started
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
recording audio recording our committee
 
01:19:53.199 --> 01:19:54.310 align:start position:0%
recording audio recording our committee
hearings

01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh do you i don't recall how many
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
microphones in the room but i know there
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
was more than one
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
at that time i think there was for those
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
there was maybe one
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
i know there was one between myself and
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
the person sitting next to me so i
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't answer that
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
definitely uh in regards to mass
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
mandates or whatever
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know how we're going to conduct the
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
hearings and all these rules
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to depend on really how many
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
people are present
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
and that are going to participate in
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
person uh also i need to know more about
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
makeup of the room's going to be uh i
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
need to know
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
exactly how it's being cleaned and then
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
the air is being cleaned
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i i what i do know is that i want it
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
to be consistent
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be a committee
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
specific rule that on this committee
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing that
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to do this or on
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
this committee we're wearing mass but
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
other committees don't it's going to be
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding it needs to be a
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
uniform if it's going to be a rule like
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to come
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
a uniform rule for all the committees
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
what i will say to the people sitting on
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not interested in having any
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
scientific arguments about masks i think
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
we've all had them more than once
 
01:21:02.719 --> 01:21:03.590 align:start position:0%
we've all had them more than once
already

01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
and we don't need to go down that road
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any of us
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
having being a doctor on that subject so
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do that
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
i would just ask that uh regardless what
 
01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:15.750 align:start position:0%
i would just ask that uh regardless what
you

01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
where position your you feel on that
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
topic that we try to be as respectful to
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
everyone on the committee
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
as possible um and i think that's
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
important to really
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
focus on that i i wouldn't want anyone
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
to feel
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
disrespected whether it you know
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we're talking about
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
so try to welcome everyone you can every
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
which way possible
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative pantholakis yes wouldn't
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
it gov
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
governor's mandate require that we do
 
01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.830 align:start position:0%
governor's mandate require that we do
that

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for your question so
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
that's a legal question
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh my opinion which um
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
this is my opinion i'm just one person
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
is that an executive order or a state of
 
01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:04.550 align:start position:0%
is that an executive order or a state of
emergency

01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily apply to
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch because of
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
separation of power issues just like
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh i recall many years ago when i lived
 
01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:15.669 align:start position:0%
uh i recall many years ago when i lived
in

01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
south boston there was an emergency
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
because of the marathon
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
bombing and although there was a
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
complete shutdown during that tragic
 
01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.590 align:start position:0%
complete shutdown during that tragic
incident

01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
incident
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
the court system was not subject to that
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
order because it's a separate division
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
of government
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
and i had a court hearing that day and i
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
was trying to figure out how do i get to
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
the courthouse
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
without violating the executive order
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
and naturally no one would take my call
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
at the courthouse
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
so i had my work cut out for me the time
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
i got there they sent me home
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
saying we're not doing any hearings
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
would be nice to answer the phone but
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is we wouldn't have
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
to necessarily uh
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
we would necessarily fall into that but
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
also the executive order
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
is only my interpretation is only
 
01:22:58.239 --> 01:22:59.430 align:start position:0%
is only my interpretation is only
operative

01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
operative
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're able to solicit
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
distance i don't believe that there is a
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
mass mandate
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that it does apply i
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
think we would be exempt
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
if we're socially distancing now six
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
feet apart
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's great it doesn't mean you
 
01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
should or should not wear a mask based
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
on the fact that you're socially
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
distancing but i don't wouldn't say
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're violating the executive order
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative newman
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman my question is for
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
public hearings work sessions
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
and executive sessions do you anticipate
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
that there will come a time where there
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
will be no virtual capability for the
 
01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:42.870 align:start position:0%
will be no virtual capability for the
legislators

01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
to participate and vote in those
 
01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.950 align:start position:0%
to participate and vote in those
meetings

01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to operate with
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
what's in front of me now right now
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
we're doing we're going to be doing it
 
01:23:57.679 --> 01:23:58.310 align:start position:0%
we're doing we're going to be doing it
remotely

01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
because i know that the community rooms
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
aren't even set up yet
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
so i i don't if i anticipate something
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
i don't want to create a perception that
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
this is how we're going to do it when
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's as we've seen with this
 
01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.629 align:start position:0%
i think it's as we've seen with this
pandemic

01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
it's a forever changing situation yeah
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
if i tell you something today two days
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
from now it can be outdated so i don't
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
tell you we're going to do something
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
that we're in and we're not going to do
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
it i think what we need to do is get to
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
get the room set up and see how it's
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
going to look
 
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
then i know for the time being the
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to do them on
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
zoom or remotely and it's at the choice
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh whether they want to
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
appear in person or not
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
now that could change but again i think
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a work in progress
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up question a follow-up question
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
would just be
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
the you said there is a potential for us
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
um public hearings and executive
 
01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.189 align:start position:0%
um public hearings and executive
sessions

01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
on the same day and so that
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it seems like that could
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
bring the date
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
when we may be where we may not have a
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
virtual capability
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
a lot closer than the far future so it's
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
something to really think about thank
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative newman and and
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
again with the executive sessions being
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
on the same day as the public hearing
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that was ever it's
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
none of our
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
preference that's not my first choice
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't i don't
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
believe it really it's it's policy that
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
we want to follow long term
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
but given the time distance and pandemic
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
that we're in
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh we're doing we have to really
 
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
handle this a lot of hearings not the
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
way we would like to i think i speak for
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
all of us we would love to meet in
 
01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.629 align:start position:0%
all of us we would love to meet in
person

01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
and and sit together and get this done
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
in a non-covenanting world but it's just
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate so i don't i don't want
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
to represent newman
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
yeah just to follow up i just wanted to
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
be clear about it
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
i don't have an objection to doing that
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
my my real concern is
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
the lack of a virtual capability for
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
legislators to participate
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and if there's any members of
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
the committee who have any
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
issues with their systems their
 
01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.870 align:start position:0%
issues with their systems their
computers

01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
computers
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
please let myself know let the committee
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
assistant know
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
let representative welch know and let
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
the ranking member uh
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know let representative gather right
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
now just let everyone know that you're
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
having these issues because again
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
we would hate to see someone not
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
participate because of uh
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
technical difficulties representative
 
01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:40.870 align:start position:0%
technical difficulties representative
welch

01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
welch
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to remind you that
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
being chairman of a committee
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
gives you a lot of discretion
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
in how the committee operates now i
 
01:26:50.719 --> 01:26:51.030 align:start position:0%
in how the committee operates now i
think

01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
war and i certainly are in the category
 
01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:54.390 align:start position:0%
war and i certainly are in the category
where

01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
we probably want to wear a mess and
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
participation in person is very
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
important to me
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
i don't like zoom meetings i mean i
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
understand the necessity of it
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we can really do a
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
good job for the people of the state
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
with a zoom meeting i really think we
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
need to be there
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can figure out how to do
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
i'm i a little reluctant to speak for
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
laura but i'm going to wear a mask
 
01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
i don't want to curtail something that
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
i want to go to 100. but
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
you as a chairman you have a lot of
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
discretion on how things
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
operate and going to the clerk all the
 
01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:43.990 align:start position:0%
operate and going to the clerk all the
time

01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
is not going to it's not going to be
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
very helpful because sometimes the clerk
 
01:27:48.639 --> 01:27:49.270 align:start position:0%
very helpful because sometimes the clerk
doesn't

01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
really understand what goes on in
 
01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:52.709 align:start position:0%
really understand what goes on in
committee

01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
he's clerk has never been a chairman
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's it my my me deferring to the
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
clerk was
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
an effort to not debate too long with
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
the representative from goffstown
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
because him and i can
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
debate topics for hours whether we're on
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
the same side or against each other
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
which we
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
we always seem to be arguing time so
 
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
the interest of everyone out in time
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
constraints i'm going to look into that
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
i know there's some
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
i do know it was with respect to
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
representative burt's question
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
there is some disagreement on that rule
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh but i
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
the way i i look at it is that if you're
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
the my interpretation give a
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor or prize sponsor then you
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be testifying and when it comes
 
01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:32.950 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be testifying and when it comes
to

01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh meeting in person if it
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
if it comes down to you know
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
every you the members of the committee
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
if it comes down to wearing a mask and
 
01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:43.350 align:start position:0%
if it comes down to wearing a mask and
not

01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know you're free to voice your
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
concern with that you know
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at it as if it comes down to
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
getting 20 people to meet together in a
 
01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:52.149 align:start position:0%
getting 20 people to meet together in a
room

01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
and it's going to come down to wearing a
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
mask i would hope that
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
i me the issue of wearing a mask or a
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
face shield is not what prevents that
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
from happening
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
but i haven't got that commitment from
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
everyone on the committee yet so
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
without that commitment i'm i mean not
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
inclined to make any type of
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
or suggest any type of mandate like that
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
if if i get 20 people or
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
19 whatever tell me if we wear masks
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
i'll come in and meet in person
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
i agree 100 percent meeting in person
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
nothing is
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
is going to replace that uh the people
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
on this committee
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
or you know representative newman from
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
nashville you know i consider you
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
a good friend you and i talk on the
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
phone about when we talk half the stuff
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
we talk about
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's unrelated to what we're doing as
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
representatives i mean i consider your
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
friend i consider a lot of you friends
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i think those relationships were
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
built when we met in person and i think
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
as can we get business done through zoom
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
of course we can but are we going to
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
develop those relationships
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know representative bradley you're a
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
new member
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
and it's it's great to meet you i i
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
feel that if we met in person it would
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
be much better
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
and we can kind of get a feel for each
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
other and that's when i say oh i'm
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
approachable needs to talk to
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
i feel that the people who serve me
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
serve with me on this committee
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
would stand by that and know that that's
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
the case and just as i'm comfortable
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
approaching you know representative muse
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
of representative gather right
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
even representative antolokis who can be
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
very i'm i still
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
can't vote for you because we we work
 
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
together and we develop those
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
relationships so
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's for me that's really really
 
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
important and some of the members
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
of the of of the committee who are
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
returning members but didn't serve
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
last year you know we didn't we didn't
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
same you know working relationship but i
 
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
think developing that
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
is going to make us all better
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
representatives and make us a better
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole so i would hope
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
that we can do that and
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
if people tell me that the difference is
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
a map
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
it comes down to wearing masks that that
 
01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:54.790 align:start position:0%
it comes down to wearing masks that that
will

01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
be taken into consideration but i
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%

please please uh do so representative
knight

01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you chairman for recognizing me
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
to ask a question
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
since i am only a second termer
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
um i am still learning about rules
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to circle back to what
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative pintilakis
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
asked about confliction with
 
01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
the governor's orders and in regards to
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
house rules
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
do house rules are they only protecting
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
house members
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
is would it be different for members of
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
coming to speak would they still be
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
responsible for upholding a dif like a
 
01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:51.270 align:start position:0%
responsible for upholding a dif like a
different

01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
law so just a point of clarification
 
01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.950 align:start position:0%
law so just a point of clarification
there

01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think
 
01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's also a legal question so i'm just
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
speaking casually as one individual not
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
speaking so don't if any get in trouble
 
01:32:07.199 --> 01:32:07.510 align:start position:0%
speaking so don't if any get in trouble
for

01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
violating any any mass mandate because
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
of what i said that your
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
don't don't don't bring me down with you
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
no i mean if you're going to look into
 
01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.070 align:start position:0%
no i mean if you're going to look into
this

01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
if you were going to follow up with that
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
those questions i would really
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you looked into that
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
one too so
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
one one to answer that question though
 
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:27.669 align:start position:0%
one one to answer that question though
is

01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
members of the public if we all meet in
 
01:32:30.159 --> 01:32:31.270 align:start position:0%
members of the public if we all meet in
person

01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
at the at the lob members of the public
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
will still be
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh testifying testifying and
 
01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.470 align:start position:0%
uh testifying testifying and
participating

01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
participating
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh through zoom so they won't be in the
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
in the room with us
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
it would only be the members of the
 
01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee present
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
in the room is my understanding there
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
may be a staff member as well
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
assisting us with some of the technical
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
side of things
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
so that the issue of the mass mandate
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
and as it applies to members of the
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
public wouldn't
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really be come up because they
 
01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be in the room
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
i will say that if we ever did have live
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
witnesses appear
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh in i would think it would be
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
disingenuous for us to expect them to
 
01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
wear a mask and us not to
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
i think that that's not good practice
 
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
so if we ever got to that point i would
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
encourage that all of us
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh be united on that because we that's
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
you know not don't do as i just don't do
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
as i say
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
not as i do i don't i don't follow that
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
so i would i would
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
change my my opinion on that very
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
quickly but i don't i don't see that
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
happening at least in the first
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
year unfortunately representative
 
01:33:49.110 --> 01:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh uh having
 
01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
served on a lot of committees
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
one of the uh um basic rules
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
has been to
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
not bring any uh like political attire
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
when you come into the committee the the
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
premise is you're trying to make
 
01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh citizens that come to the state house
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
feel as comfortable as possible
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
so if i came in with my mega hat on
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
people that were on the other side of
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
the political spectrum might be offended
 
01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:21.510 align:start position:0%
the political spectrum might be offended
and

01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
i think they're be under the impression
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get a fair hearing
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
now that we're on zoom it does it
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
follow that we should be cognizant of
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
what is in the room with us in other
 
01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.950 align:start position:0%
what is in the room with us in other
words

01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
if i have an irish republican army
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
flag in the back back i don't have one
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
but if i had something like that in the
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
back of me
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
or or uh political uh activist
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
type paraphernalia around me is that
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh prohibited so that we don't alienate
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
members of the public who will be seeing
 
01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.629 align:start position:0%
members of the public who will be seeing
us

01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you my understanding of
 
01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:05.270 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you my understanding of
that

01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
the issue of you know having attire that
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
it represents a political uh
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
for example a maga hat uh at the
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
speaker when he would rule on that it
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
would have to do with the fact that he
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
was a candidate
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
um at this point in time uh
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
president trump's not not a candidate i
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
i would
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
prefer no one i don't believe wearing a
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
hat is
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
in line with the dress code from what i
 
01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:34.390 align:start position:0%
in line with the dress code from what i
understand

01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
but assuming that it was and you were
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to wear a hat i would say that
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
he's not a candidate
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
with that being said uh
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
and i voiced this to the committee last
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
year because i know there was some
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
issues with
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
certain actually involved people
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
bringing maga hats to the committee
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
hearings i will say that
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's not much of a surprise if if
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
someone on this committee wore
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
a joe biden pin or whatever i wouldn't
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
personally i wouldn't have any issue
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
with that i can understand that members
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the public
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
i would hope are not intimidated by that
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
and they and they should not be
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
intimidated by that i
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
but i would not recommend wearing
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
anything that this
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
that distracts from what we're doing
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
here and i think
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
myself uh representative welch and
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative wallace learned that the
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
hard way
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
even though we you know we may wore
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
something to mean one thing
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
and it was interpreted to mean something
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
else and all
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
that spiral out of control relatively
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
but so i would ask them to be conscious
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
of what you wear
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
for that reason hello representative
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
so that that's my thought on that uh
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
in regards to your background again
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
you don't want to have anything that's
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
distracting because again we're
 
01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.109 align:start position:0%
distracting because again we're
testifying

01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh people are testifying before us so
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
avoiding those distractions would be
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
something i would just encourage
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
now if someone has a something that's
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
um you know whether it's a republican
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
flag or a democratic flag
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of a rule that makes that
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
prohibited i will say i mean if i'm i'm
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
a registered
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
republican i'm elected as a republican
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
official if i had any type of republican
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
symbol in the background i don't think
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
that would come as much a surprise to
 
01:37:28.719 --> 01:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
that would come as much a surprise to
anyone

01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
just my opinion
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i just had a follow-up
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
question on the uh
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the the mass requirement
 
01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:47.350 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the the mass requirement
issue

01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
i'm curious if in the setup of
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh the committee rooms and uh you you
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there are hepa filtering
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
and some other things that are taking
 
01:37:57.119 --> 01:37:58.310 align:start position:0%
and some other things that are taking
place

01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any public health
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
expert who's actually
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
basically said that it would be okay for
 
01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:05.830 align:start position:0%
basically said that it would be okay for
people

01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh who are attending meetings in those
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
room to be attending them
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
without masks or is it being assumed
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
that this level of protection would be
 
01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:16.790 align:start position:0%
that this level of protection would be
okay

01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
for or the level of risk would be
 
01:38:19.119 --> 01:38:20.229 align:start position:0%
for or the level of risk would be
acceptable

01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
if people in the room were actually
 
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
masking up and
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
and one of the other things that i did
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
want to say too is that
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic i mean we've had
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
almost 800 deaths in new hampshire we've
 
01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:31.750 align:start position:0%
almost 800 deaths in new hampshire we've
had

01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
close to 400 000 in the united states
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
there's a new covet variant
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's in connecticut right now and that
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
probably is going to hit here
 
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
there may be a couple of people on the
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
committee who may be
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
in line to get vaccinated you know at
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
some point
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
in you know in february or june but what
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
i what i would ask is a courtesy
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
um just to other members on the
 
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee given the fact that we're all
 
01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:58.070 align:start position:0%
committee given the fact that we're all
vulnerable

01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
to this uh and that you know i think
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
most of us mentioned the family members
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we care about and our grandchildren
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
and our kids and everything else
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
just as a matter of courtesy uh i would
 
01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:10.790 align:start position:0%
just as a matter of courtesy uh i would
ask

01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee that you know
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
when and if we do get together in person
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
that um this is just something that we
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
all do
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i i would do it to protect any of
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
you and
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that you would do it to
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
protect each other to protect me to
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
protect my family
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
it's the one thing that we can do and i
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
know we have varying opinions on
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
how comfortable it is and and you know
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
and ultimately how effective it is
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
um but um uh dr chan
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
our state public health br ex public
 
01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:44.790 align:start position:0%
our state public health br ex public
health

01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
experts uh along with dr falchi at the
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
national level i mean
 
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
they're basically all saying that this
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
is some the one thing that we can do as
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
individuals that would really help
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
and just to sort of start fresh
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
if we want to kind of build that
 
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.350 align:start position:0%
if we want to kind of build that
atmosphere

01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
atmosphere
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
of trust and collaboration and working
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
together that i think we've been talking
 
01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:08.070 align:start position:0%
together that i think we've been talking
about

01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
that would really be a great way for
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
people to display
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
that you know we are on the same team at
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
least when it comes to dealing with this
 
01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:19.590 align:start position:0%
least when it comes to dealing with this
pandemic

01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative news my so
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
no one's assuming anything we're not
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
just oh here's an air filter i saw on
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
amazon let's uh
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
put it in the lob and turn it on i don't
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
think it's that i
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding there were engineers
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
that were retained and there's
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
there is some scientific backing on
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
what's being done now i haven't asked
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
will these air filters be sufficient
 
01:40:46.639 --> 01:40:47.510 align:start position:0%
will these air filters be sufficient
enough

01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
to you know replace the need for a mask
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
um even if i'm told yes i you know if
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
i still would and say i'm gonna wear a
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
mask either way
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's just me all right so i'm not
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
whether the the scientist engineer
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
whatever the title is tells me
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
oh you don't need one these air filters
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
they got it taken care of
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'm still gonna wear one anyway so
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
that's just me
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
um i i for people who agree with me in
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
fall that league
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
great but i don't know if one
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily replaces the other
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
and i haven't asked that question but i
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
do know that the people that are
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
engineering the or re organizing the
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
lob to try to make it as safe as
 
01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:31.590 align:start position:0%
lob to try to make it as safe as
possible

01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh this is a this is their expertise so
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
i would my explanation may not be doing
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
their work justice but i do know that
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work being done
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of consultation being
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
done and
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the progress was delayed
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
sadly with the passion of speaker hinch
 
01:41:51.119 --> 01:41:51.830 align:start position:0%
sadly with the passion of speaker hinch
so

01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
that was kind of uh that delayed the
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
process so i know them the air filters
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
literally arrived yesterday from what i
 
01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.189 align:start position:0%
literally arrived yesterday from what i
understand

01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
so they're not even i don't know what
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
the status those are and again we're
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
going to try to get us up and running as
 
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
fast as possible
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
um no only only just to say that no
 
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.350 align:start position:0%
um no only only just to say that no
matter

01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
matter
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
i think we deal with the same issue in
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
restaurants and and i think one of the
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
things that we found is that
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of people in new hampshire when it
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
comes to eating indoors at restaurants
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
have been voting with their feet
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
um and that it has hurt our restaurants
 
01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:26.310 align:start position:0%
um and that it has hurt our restaurants
but

01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we hear
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
consistently is being in a closed
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh space with other people um during
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
this pandemic
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
is just simply not a good idea so what
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
i'm saying is
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
um while i think it's great that um
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
you know that uh that the house is
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
taking steps
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
to make these rooms safer uh for us to
 
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
meet in
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's one step that we can all take
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves that will just increase the
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
level of safety and decrease the level
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
of risk
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
um even more and and and frankly
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
my constituents here in portsmouth would
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
expect me
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
to be asking these questions um because
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'm very much
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
is the potential for any of us to bring
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
this back to our communities and i don't
 
01:43:13.109 --> 01:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
think that's and something any of us
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
really wants to do i know
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know mr chairman your committee has
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
your community has been especially hard
 
01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:19.830 align:start position:0%
your community has been especially hard
hit

01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
hit
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh during covet i think salem is around
 
01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:23.189 align:start position:0%
uh during covet i think salem is around
the

01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
the third or fourth uh highest um you
 
01:43:26.239 --> 01:43:26.550 align:start position:0%
the third or fourth uh highest um you
know

01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
incidents of cases in the state and and
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
more deaths than anybody wants to think
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
about and i just think that
 
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
again part of our responsibility you
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
know as
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
as legislators is to do what we can to
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
sort of tamp this thing down
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
and and sometimes that behavior just
 
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
needs to translate to
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
the things that we do at the personal
 
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
level and the example that we set for
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
other people
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
so i think new hampshire new hampshire
 
01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
is really going to be watching all of us
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
to see what we're doing
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
um and and i think it's really important
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative newson and i
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
you did say a great point and
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know we'll just reiterate this to
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
the public that
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know i'm 37 years old i you know
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
god bless me if i were ever to contract
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
over 19 i would fall into the 99.9
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
range but that's it's not about just me
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's about the people that i'm around
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know i i have
 
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
i mentioned earlier my wife's pregnant
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
and that puts her in a high risk
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
category so
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh what may not affect you as much may
 
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
affect someone else
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's in your household or person
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
sitting next to you
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that just emphasizing that
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
that don't look at
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
just as how this affects you it's how it
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
affects everyone around you
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important to just always
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
remember that that
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
everyone has different circumstances i'm
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
not asking anyone to
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
disclose their um private medical
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
information to the committee
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
but if there's members of this committee
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
that i know
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
are considered to be a higher risk uh
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
and that's something that i think we
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
should be conscious of as well now
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
whether we do something that that
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
scientifically works or not is is
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
not the point if it's something that
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
just even if it's a 10
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
help whatever i mean i would i would
 
01:45:19.590 --> 01:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
hope that we all just do our best to
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
make everyone
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable and welcome not just members
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
of the public but members of the
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
committee make them feel welcomed
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
to come and uh participate in the
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
committee meetings
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
thanks um i actually had three questions
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
my first one
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
was have you picked a name yet for your
 
01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.229 align:start position:0%
was have you picked a name yet for your
daughter

01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's uh well ultimately it's up to my
 
01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:47.669 align:start position:0%
it's uh well ultimately it's up to my
wife

01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
wife
 
01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not supposed to say that's okay
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
we haven't picked anything
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's up to her i will uh
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
i will let you guys know once we once
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
she arrives at a conclusion
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
my my second question was um
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
so i've been trying to follow along and
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.629 --> 01:46:10.639 align:start position:0%
only the legislators and staff will be
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
allowed in the lob and if the public
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
wants to give testimony there to do that
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
over zoom is that correct
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
correct right and so i was wondering um
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
what was the uh maybe this isn't like
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
something that you can answer
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
but it seems like if if it's not
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the public to be in the
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
building why are there legislators in
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
the building
 
01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
and it you know it just seems like
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it all be simpler if we just
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
did everything
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
via zoom but maybe that's not something
 
01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make a lot of sense you
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
know it's well the difference is
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
if the members of the and i'm just
 
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
speaking i'm not i'm speaking on behalf
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
of just
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
myself here if the if there's 20 of us
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
in our in a room and we
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
separate the wall with it's normally
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
reserved for ways and means and we are
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
all able to socially distance
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
the 20 of us and we're able to filter
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
the air
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
i would assume that that air filtration
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
is somewhat taking a consideration that
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have 50 people in
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
the room
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
or 60 people in the room if you open
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
that committee meeting
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
to the general public in the double even
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
in the double room
 
01:47:24.629 --> 01:47:24.639 align:start position:0%
it would be very difficult to socially
 
01:47:24.639 --> 01:47:25.350 align:start position:0%
it would be very difficult to socially
distance

01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
distance
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
with members of the public uh two the
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll need someone to enforce that
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
in socially distancing
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
and to enforce whatever other mandates
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
are in place so you would
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
likely every committee room would likely
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
have to have you know
 
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
their own security or sergeant or
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
someone to enforce these rules
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
it gets much more complicated when it's
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
just the 20 legislators
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
in the room i think we can
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
we can make sure that we're socially
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
distancing we can make sure
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
that that's being followed so i think
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why you don't open it
 
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
to the public you really would have to
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
really allow it for rep's hall
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
but at the same time that's there's only
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
so it's also difficult uh and then
 
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're just saying that
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
the the committee that can be there is
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
kind of the upper limit for what could
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
how many people can safely be present in
 
01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:19.270 align:start position:0%
how many people can safely be present in
person

01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
no it's just it's math it's the room is
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
a certain size
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
and if a room is you know x amount of
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
square feet
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
and everyone needs to be six feet apart
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
you only can fit a certain amount of
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
people in said room uh
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
when it comes to a public hearing we
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh we don't want to limit attendance to
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
say all right we only allow 10 people
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
into public hearing
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
that would be inappropriate i know there
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
was a huge uproar last year it was a
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
senate hearing
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
um and they there was just not enough
 
01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:49.030 align:start position:0%
um and they there was just not enough
room

01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
in the room this is pre-covered but
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
there was people
 
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
waiting all in the in the lobby trying
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
to get in there to testify
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
it was never going to work out and that
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't to me that wasn't
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
fair to the members of the public that
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
showed up appeared and then couldn't get
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
01:49:06.629 --> 01:49:06.639 align:start position:0%
so i would hate to see that happen to
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
anyone and i also don't want it to be a
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
oh the first eight people that showed up
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
at the lobbyists or
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
special whatever and then members of the
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
public sorry there's not enough room
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
i think also generally speaking
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
having if you were to have all those
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
people in the lob
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's not just our committee it's all the
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
other committees that are meeting that
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
day they're gonna have issues as well
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
so you don't if you if you have 30
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
people show up for our committee
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
meetings because we're gonna we might
 
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
have a lot of bills scheduled that day
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
and you have 30 people show up at
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
another committee and 30 you know
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
it can start to overflow relatively
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
quickly all of a sudden you can have a
 
01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:42.950 align:start position:0%
quickly all of a sudden you can have a
lot

01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
lot
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh the place can be overflowing so
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
i think that's having just us in the
 
01:49:49.679 --> 01:49:50.709 align:start position:0%
i think that's having just us in the
building

01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
again not my preference but i think it
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
would it still works
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you that makes a lot of sense i
 
01:49:59.589 --> 01:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
think what you're saying is
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
if we had everyone testifying it
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be safe but
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
just having the committee present with
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
the um air filters and so forth probably
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
is safe enough to do and then my my last
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
question was and i saved them all up
 
01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:14.149 align:start position:0%
question was and i saved them all up
sorry

01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
um so you said earlier that you really
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
want us to
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
get along and i'm really excited about
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
that because i don't want all the stress
 
01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:21.589 align:start position:0%
that because i don't want all the stress
of

01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
drama you know we have enough drama
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
already um everywhere else in the world
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and you said that if you have a
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
problem with something in another member
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
stun that you should bring up with them
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
and not bring it to social media
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
and i know kind of where you're speaking
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
from because i remember hearing
 
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
from you and representative welch about
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
how personally um you were impacted
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
after the whole um issue with the pearls
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
and that you know you had death threats
 
01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:48.629 align:start position:0%
and that you know you had death threats
and

01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative welch like shut off his
 
01:50:50.639 --> 01:50:51.669 align:start position:0%
representative welch like shut off his
email

01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
email
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like it was really it's
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
certainly not something i ever want to
 
01:50:54.639 --> 01:50:55.830 align:start position:0%
certainly not something i ever want to
experience

01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
um and so i was wondering if your
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
issue with another member comes up when
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're in a public hearing or in an exec
 
01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:04.149 align:start position:0%
we're in a public hearing or in an exec
session

01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
where we're in the public's view
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
private conversations aren't really
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
possible or appropriate
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
would you want us to bring up our
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
concern about another member
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
to you in the public hearing or would
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
you want us to hold it until it's over
 
01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
and and i'm and mentioning this in case
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
it's an issue of like behavior like if
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
someone's repeatedly doing something
 
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
that you think is inappropriate would
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
you bring it up to the chair
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
or would you want us to wait until it's
 
01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:29.990 align:start position:0%
or would you want us to wait until it's
over

01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
noting especially that now that we're
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know recorded and it's um
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
that it may be like bringing up an issue
 
01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
with the chair during the hearing
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
would almost be the equivalent of
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
putting it on social media at this point
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of what i was curious
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
about and i'll mute myself and stop
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
asking questions now thank you
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your point what my
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
point is is that if
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
to any member of this committee now
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
whether you want to bring it up
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
privately after the committee hearing
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
or if you want to raise it during the
 
01:51:59.199 --> 01:52:00.870 align:start position:0%
or if you want to raise it during the
hearing

01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
i think i will tell each member that
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
they're free to raise it during the
 
01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.669 align:start position:0%
they're free to raise it during the
hearing

01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:05.679 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
or they can we can discuss it with me
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
directly after the hearing
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem if if anyone on
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
this committee feels that another member
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know showing uh appropriate decorum
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
i feel that
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
i would hope that they would bring that
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
to my attention right away
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
or to representative welsh's attention
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
right away bring it to someone's
 
01:52:27.599 --> 01:52:28.149 align:start position:0%
right away bring it to someone's
attention

01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
because one of the issues i
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know brought up and it's not a
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
defense to anything that happened last
 
01:52:34.159 --> 01:52:35.030 align:start position:0%
defense to anything that happened last
term

01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
but no one on the committee raised any
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
concern to
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
the seven members that were wearing a
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
symbol no one said anything to us during
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh no members of the committee said
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
anything to us uh the chairman didn't
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
say anything to us
 
01:52:50.070 --> 01:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
no so all the people in charge of
 
01:52:52.149 --> 01:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
decorum didn't say anything to us
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
yet you know things kind of went in
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
another direction now
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
i my point with that is if
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
someone said something during the
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
hearing and raised the issue of decorum
 
01:53:06.629 --> 01:53:06.639 align:start position:0%
i would have respected that and i can
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
imagine other members of the community
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
would have as well
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that would have really
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
helped us all out now when it comes to
 
01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:13.669 align:start position:0%
helped us all out now when it comes to
raising

01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
raising
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
other concerns my my my thought is
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
if you are willing to type something
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
on twitter or whatever social media
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
platform you're using
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
and publish it you're not you you're
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
i myself you have there's no rule saying
 
01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
you can't do that i would just hope
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
whatever it is you type
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
on your your tablet or your computer or
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
your phone
 
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
that you're willing to say that same
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
thing to the committee directly
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
and i would hope and it's just my
 
01:53:44.239 --> 01:53:44.870 align:start position:0%
and i would hope and it's just my
preference

01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
preference
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
that whether it's a positive or negative
 
01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:48.709 align:start position:0%
that whether it's a positive or negative
comment

01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate to hear it from you
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
directly rather than you know read about
 
01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:52.310 align:start position:0%
directly rather than you know read about
it

01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
on twitter or facebook i to me just it
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
means a lot more to hear it directly and
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's why i represented my comments
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
i referenced my conversation with
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative gathright that
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
i don't believe she ever published
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
anything about that on social media
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
but i think from me and representative
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
gatherette's relationship
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
on a professional level it actually
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
improved the law
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
and it means a lot to me to have these
 
01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
good relationships with people on this
 
01:54:18.159 --> 01:54:19.109 align:start position:0%
good relationships with people on this
committee

01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
that we can have these conversations uh
 
01:54:21.199 --> 01:54:22.149 align:start position:0%
that we can have these conversations uh
so

01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
my recommendation is if people follow
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
the lead myself from representing
 
01:54:28.159 --> 01:54:29.270 align:start position:0%
the lead myself from representing
gathering

01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
gathering
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
with us i thought that was a good thing
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
and represent gather if you disagree i
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
thought it was a good conversation to
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
and i thought it you know on a
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
professional level after that i thought
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
we could talk about anything
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
exactly and in the same way and
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
when you put something on social media
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
this is more general advice
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
i may post something and but then other
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
people may
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
take it much further in any direction
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
and just when you're talking about
 
01:54:57.510 --> 01:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
members of this committee
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of and very important
 
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
issues we're going to have especially
 
01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:01.910 align:start position:0%
issues we're going to have especially
involving

01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
involving
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
police reform and a lot of bills are
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm just saying that if we
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
create hurt feelings amongst ourselves
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be much more difficult for
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
us to conduct
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
business so can i stop anyone doing
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
anything no is it against the rule for
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
you to do no
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
you're free to do what you want and and
 
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
i will respect that but all i'm saying
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
is i would prefer
 
01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
and encourage people to bring it before
 
01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
the committee directly
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
and i think that that would be a
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
healthier situation for all of us
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
and you should be able to voice your
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
concerns to anyone on the committee if
 
01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:37.669 align:start position:0%
concerns to anyone on the committee if
you're

01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
upset how someone's conducting
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
themselves i don't see why it's a
 
01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.109 align:start position:0%
themselves i don't see why it's a
problem

01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
to address that to the committee
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
directly i think it's uh it's your right
 
01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:45.109 align:start position:0%
directly i think it's uh it's your right
and

01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
something that's i think would be a good
 
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
practice and perhaps we'll uh
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
will be more uh we'll set the tone and
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
lead by example with that
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative newman yeah i would just
 
01:55:58.229 --> 01:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
quick recommendation for you as you go
 
01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
ahead and discuss this
 
01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
things with the leadership is that like
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
i said before
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
my main concern is the elimination of
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
any kind of virtual capability
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
for a legislator to participate and vote
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
so that would cover the kind of all
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
committee meetings
 
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i would just make note that there
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
are plenty of places
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
plenty of legislative bodies or or other
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
governmental bodies like the school
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
board in nashua
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
where in a meeting that's with the
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
limited number of people like this
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
and there could be and some individual
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
because of their circumstances or their
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
health or whatever
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
as long as the emergency order is in
 
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
effect they would
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
they just could not bring themselves for
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
safety and the safety of their family
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
could would not attend an indoor meeting
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
as long as that was the thing
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
so you should also give you could also
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
give consideration to things like
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
you we have people in nashua that
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
um that participate in the school board
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
meeting on the telephone they can hear
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
everything that said
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
in their auto you know they take roll
 
01:57:11.589 --> 01:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
calls by voice
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
and so they're able to participate i i
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
would hate to see
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
that type of virtual capability
 
01:57:17.599 --> 01:57:18.870 align:start position:0%
that type of virtual capability
prohibited

01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
in anything that you guys decide but
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative newman um i i
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%

01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
