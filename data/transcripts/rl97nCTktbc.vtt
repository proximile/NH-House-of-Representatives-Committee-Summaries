spot so
um

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
so anyway let's I know your time is
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
precious and Melissa should be here soon
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
why don't we just get started uh we've
 
00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
already had one session on this so this
 
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.970 align:start position:0%
is uh
uh

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
study committee subcommittee on um
 
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 align:start position:0%
interim study for HB
 
00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
1295 here at 2 o'clock
 
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 align:start position:0%
and that one is the measure requiring
 
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.729 align:start position:0%
and that one is the measure requiring
reports

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
concerning school policies on classroom
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
recordings and in classroom observers we
 
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.490 align:start position:0%
recordings and in classroom observers we
spent

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
um a good period of time already uh I
 
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
know uh I wish it was not here and I
 
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
guess uh Julius wasn't either but you've
 
00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 align:start position:0%
had a chance to look at the the YouTube
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
um as have others I could tell by
 
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
looking at the number of views so anyway
 
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
we've already talked about this quite a
 
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
lot so let me just summarize again and
 
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
then we can discuss and then hopefully
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
get a motion of some sort uh and then
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
we'll do another one at three o'clock
 
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
so this is uh as we said before I know
 
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
I'm repeating myself mostly you all were
 
00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
here before modeled on the gifted
 
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
student bill which is not a law and all
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
this the intent of this measure is is
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
simply to uh as was the case with um
 
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
HP 321 the gifted bill
 
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 align:start position:0%
simply solicit reports from districts
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
for doe to and I think attorney Fenn was
 
00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 align:start position:0%
here for the previous uh session as well
 
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
so I know this is uh old news to her as
 
00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 align:start position:0%
well uh simply uh
 
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
requirement to submit reports for again
 
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
a best practices folder on policies
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
regarding uh classroom recordings and
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
classroom observers and some of this is
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh related to covet when so many schools
 
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
went remote uh when hybrid and some new
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
questions came up about uh privacy
 
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
issues and this is we've talked about
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
all this before so anyway without
 
00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 align:start position:0%
repeating all that again that's the
 
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
essence of it simply asking for reports
 
00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 align:start position:0%
for Best Practices folder so that we can
 
00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
compare approaches on
 
00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.150 align:start position:0%
compare approaches on
uh

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
classroom observations whether in person
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
or remote so this quick summary and uh
 
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
the member is assigned uh Moffat leka
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
and if Linda can't be here and if and
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have emotion in some sort of
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
emotion and vote today because the clock
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
is ticking I have no problem if
 
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
if Linda doesn't make it or if Melissa
 
00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
says she's on her way but if I have no
 
00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 align:start position:0%
problem if if Dave wants to sit in for
 
00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:58.490 align:start position:0%
problem if if Dave wants to sit in for
uh

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.189 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
I think she had put in an amendment
 
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.629 align:start position:0%
I think she had put in an amendment
um

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
and I don't see him
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
oh wait to oh H
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
um because I think the
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
bill says school district and I think
 
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
her Amendment added charter schools
 
00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
sure I remember when this first came
 
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
through that she had an amendment
 
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:38.759 align:start position:0%
actually it's one that I like personally
 
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 align:start position:0%
and um Wanted to integrate for our
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
purposes today in the chair is in the
 
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
house as well
 
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.990 align:start position:0%
house as well
um

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking for I'm looking for this
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
being an interim study committee nothing
 
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
that happens here will is going to
 
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.469 align:start position:0%
that happens here will is going to
become

00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:07:59.930 --> 00:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
um in the statute process all this is
 
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
going to be is is actually like the
 
00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:03.419 align:start position:0%
gifted bill which went to interim study
 
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
talked about it
 
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
um and recommended the concept and then
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
in subsequent term uh the bill came back
 
00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
and reflected new language that came up
 
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
from the interim study work so for our
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
purpose to say we're not gonna we don't
 
00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:22.139 align:start position:0%
need to we probably shouldn't try to get
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
into amendments it's not what this is
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
about as I see it
 
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
this is simply about giving uh some sort
 
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
of a yay or nay on the uh the bill so
 
00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
that we can pass that on to the full
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee and then if there is similar
 
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislation submitted next year uh you
 
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
know the work from from this
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will be useful in in coming
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know discussion on the future bill
 
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
so Mike do do we have an example of um
 
00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
of what the um in classroom Observer
 
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
policies are and what the in classroom
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
audio visual streaming and recording
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
policies are or look like
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
well good question I I don't have that
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
and again I'm gonna hearken back to some
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
uh earlier
 
00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
uh measures like the gifted build
 
00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:18.970 align:start position:0%
uh measures like the gifted build
um

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:18.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
what we finally try to tried and
 
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
succeeded in avoiding with that bill
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
interim study is uh getting too much
 
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
down into detail in the weeds in the
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
interim study process yeah so that
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's not really what I'm asking
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
for what I'm what I'm trying to get a
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
better understanding of and maybe
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
um attorney Fenton can help shed some
 
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
light light on this I I don't know if we
 
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
heard I don't I don't have my my notes
 
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
with me from the um from the hearing on
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
this but but I think I recall
 
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
um they're potentially there being a
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
question about whether
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
um whether this could um
 
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
have implications on on school safety
 
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
student safety faculty safety and um and
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
certainly seeing at least examples of
 
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
what these policies look like might help
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
us better understand what what possible
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
impact uh they might have but maybe
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
maybe Diana's got up got had some info
 
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
information on on how these policies
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
could read on on student staff school
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
safety okay before I Look to attorney
 
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.570 align:start position:0%
safety okay before I Look to attorney
Fenn

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
Fenn
 
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
um speaking with myself here what I
 
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
don't personally want to see us get
 
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
wrapped up in is getting into the
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
examples and details and debate about
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
this aspect or this policy of that or
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
whatever the the issue here is in very
 
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
broad simple general terms can we ask
 
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
districts to regardless of what their
 
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
policy is to Simply share what is
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
already public policy we're talking past
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
each other Mike I'm not I'm not saying
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
that that I'm not I'm not implying that
 
00:11:02.569 --> 00:11:02.579 align:start position:0%
that this legislation should should
 
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579 align:start position:0%
establish a framework for such policies
 
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
but if if if it's common that these
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
policies contain information that
 
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
um that that could impact school safety
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
student safety staff safety
 
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.750 align:start position:0%
student safety staff safety
um

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
in any way then I think we should
 
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
understand that as a committee and and
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration whether or
 
00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:30.170 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration whether or
not

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
um this is recommended for future
 
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm saying I'm not saying
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
that that it needs to
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
say what's in or what's out of these
 
00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:47.579 align:start position:0%
policies but if it's common that that
 
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
Apollo that these types of policies
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
would contain information that could
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
impact student or school or staff or
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
faculty safety they I think we should
 
00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I'm trying to track uh
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and again uh
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
to repeat myself I guess uh I just don't
 
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.130 align:start position:0%
to repeat myself I guess uh I just don't
see

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:12.140 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
our role as being to get into you know
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
details uh of which it sounds like
 
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
you're alluding to in terms of wanting
 
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
to see a model once we see a sample then
 
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
you know we can spend uh a whole lot of
 
00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
time on the merits of whatever model you
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
talk about uh that's not what I think we
 
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
want to do I think what we want to do is
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
decide if if we want to have a
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
uh report requirement sharing public
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
information in one place again I I keep
 
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
saying as was the case who gifted uh
 
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
sure uh representative leckis
 
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
I think what the issue here is if a
 
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
school's policy is specific enough that
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
um that might be used by somebody say
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
how they video the hallways or where
 
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
they're videoing or whatever if it's
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
specific enough that and these reports
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
will be public presumably could somebody
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
use them
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
um this reports that are being submitted
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
to the doe could somebody use them to
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
break into the school to do whatever and
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
can do we we need to think about that
 
00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:32.459 align:start position:0%
when we
 
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
suggest this that we would want a sort
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
of generic policy and and not something
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
specific enough that's going to go away
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
is that is that what you're
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you very much I just
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
recently met this past
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago with the infrastructure
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
commission which I also chair and we
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
were handing out Grant funds we're
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
working in conjunction with uh Jennifer
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
Harper's now gone from the Homeland
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
Securities director and there's a new
 
00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
director over there I believe it's
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
Robert Buxton we also had president at
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
that meeting uh Eddie Edwards who is the
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of uh of safety
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
department of safety here in the state
 
00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:23.459 align:start position:0%
we were handing out on the first round
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
of Grants here regarding safety security
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
in the school's access to schools
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
Communications in schools with outside
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
we had to do that meeting in closed
 
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.970 align:start position:0%
we had to do that meeting in closed
session

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
we weren't discussing any of that policy
 
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.019 align:start position:0%
due to the fact we are talking about a
 
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
very sensitive uh area in schools right
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
now and also with Homeland Security how
 
00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
they're looking at these applications
 
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
they had to do that in accordance with
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
their criteria and that criteria is
 
00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:56.389 align:start position:0%
their criteria and that criteria is
confidential

00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
and so uh yes uh representative Luna you
 
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
bring up an excellent point
 
00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
um you know we we cannot get into that
 
00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:06.019 align:start position:0%
realm we can't go there
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
the schools are working on an issue
 
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
recall when we were looking initially
 
00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
for the Emergency operation plans before
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
to doe there's concern from
 
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
superintendents and school
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
administrators that principles that by
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
submitting that are we releasing this
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
confidential information and we don't
 
00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
know where it's going
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
um and and that was they were even
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
concerned in sending that stuff to the
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
data processing people at Homeland
 
00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:33.650 align:start position:0%
data processing people at Homeland
Security

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
Security
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
so uh this is very sensitive territory
 
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
and I I'm having some Deja Vu here again
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh what are you
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
what is what happened uh again years ago
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
the gifted Bill where we're wedded about
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
this what about this scenario getting
 
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
down the ways and that is not where uh
 
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
is a prime sponsor that's not what I'm
 
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
looking to get into or was looking to
 
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
get into this uh the purpose here today
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
is not to get into all these details and
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
scenarios our purpose as I see it is the
 
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and the chair of this uh
 
00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
interop study committee is simply to uh
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
recommend or not that the the concept of
 
00:16:19.569 --> 00:16:19.579 align:start position:0%
having a best practice folder be
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
be put into place
 
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.170 align:start position:0%
be put into place
um

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
as soon as attorney fem this year I know
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
that she's already spoken to all this if
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
I can ask Diana
 
00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:31.550 align:start position:0%
I can ask Diana
um

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
do you mind coming up to where you've
 
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
sat many times in the past very briefly
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
so my again my question to Diana
 
00:16:42.839 --> 00:16:44.449 align:start position:0%
so my again my question to Diana
is

00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:44.459 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:45.949 align:start position:0%
is
simply

00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
can the purpose of this is is to have a
 
00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
central uh virtual folder if if you
 
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
would to centralize public information
 
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
all of these existing policies or
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
published policies so there's there's
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's no uh
 
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.929 align:start position:0%
there's no uh
uh

00:17:04.929 --> 00:17:04.939 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
there's no need to as I see it to uh
 
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
take specials or replace special
 
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339 align:start position:0%
safeguards for something that's already
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
public policy so anyway uh attorney Fen
 
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
um my question to you is if you could
 
00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:23.459 align:start position:0%
speak to what you did the last time
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
about doe uh doing the same thing with
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question for the
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
record Diana Fenton from the Department
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
of Education to answer representative
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
luno's question I I myself am not
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
familiar with these policies I I am
 
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
making an assumption that school
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
districts have these types of policies
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
on their website available to the public
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
but I don't I'm not here to speak from
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
personal knowledge about that I know the
 
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
last time we were here we did talk about
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
that potential safety security issue
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
um when we deal with Homeland Security
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
issues and for example school districts
 
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
have to submit as representative Ladd as
 
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
well where they have to submit their
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
blueprints their safety plans
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
those that information by law is not
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
accessible under 91a so we cannot turn
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
those over to the public and and there's
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
a very valid security reason behind that
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
and they are housed with Homeland
 
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
Security it's not within the purview of
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education in terms of
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
this proposed bill in front of us my
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
testimony before my testimony today is
 
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
simply that based on the language of the
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
law that is ultimately passed
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
anticipating that it would mirror in
 
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
large part
 
00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:48.539 align:start position:0%
what was passed as it pertains to
 
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
gifted students talented and gifted
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
students the department would set up a
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
similar format
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
by which it's electronic
 
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
um we do have a proposed template that
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
districts can use so that there is
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
consistency in reporting consistency is
 
00:19:08.169 --> 00:19:08.179 align:start position:0%
always key
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
I think the definition is each district
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
can create their own definition of what
 
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
they consider gifted and talented and
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
then we put it in a folder that is
 
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.850 align:start position:0%
then we put it in a folder that is
accessible

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
for people
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
I know that that was one of the concerns
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
from the Department when that bill not
 
00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
this bill but that bill was for first
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
proposed is how this information would
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
be accessible what the department would
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
do with it and that was the Compromise
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you much questions for attorney
 
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.650 align:start position:0%
thank you much questions for attorney
Fen

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
Fen
 
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
um Bruno
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
so thanks very much
 
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.330 align:start position:0%
so thanks very much
um

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.250 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
Donna our um
 
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to find a a link to on
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
the doe site to what um what are the
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
required School statutory required
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
School Board policies and I believe
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
from time on the board that that the um
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
that that there is a required policy for
 
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%
audio video recording
 
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it's the same as
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
what's being asked of here I don't
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
recall if there's a required policy for
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
in-classroom observers do you know if if
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
that's a required policy
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
the short answer is I don't off the top
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
of my head I know that there was a law
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
that was passed a few sessions ago that
 
00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:33.299 align:start position:0%
talked about in classroom observations
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
and I think there's a notice requirement
 
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
affiliated with that I don't know if
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
there's a policy requirement
 
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
um so these are great questions too
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
blush out and it is at this moment in
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
time that I can say uh while being
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
recorded I did not bring my law book
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
today and I knew I forgot something so I
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
knew I packed my lunch and my laptop and
 
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
I knew I forgot something and that's it
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
so um I do know that there is a law that
 
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
talks about those in classroom
 
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
recordings but I think your point is uh
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
well made is figuring out the difference
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
and especially since covid those are
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
probably areas that get very modeled
 
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.870 align:start position:0%
probably areas that get very modeled
um

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
from a district perspective
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
and and I think to that to that extent
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
if it's not a required School Board
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
policy then it could be an
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
administrative practice
 
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
um and which could contain
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
um sensitive information like like what
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
what Rick was was talking about that
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
hadn't been aired during a public uh
 
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:48.890 align:start position:0%
hadn't been aired during a public uh
hearing

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
we I can't remember the number of years
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
ago when represent cordelli presented
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
his bill on recording in the classroom
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
caused a tsunami of concern from all the
 
00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
districts and we got in the area of
 
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
special education services who's
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
qualifying confidential information we
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
got into the business of student
 
00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
teachers that are are practicing are
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
doing their internship or whatever in
 
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
the classroom and and how do you do how
 
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
do you record that even with the special
 
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:24.020 align:start position:0%
service child
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
so uh I don't I don't have my folder
 
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
with me either today my my yellow book's
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
in there but that wouldn't help me my
 
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
folder would help me on this one but I I
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
think that this is an area that if we're
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
looking for you know a boilerplate
 
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.750 align:start position:0%
looking for you know a boilerplate
policies

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
I believe those are in place from the
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
school boards Association
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
and I've seen those but then what we had
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
this is where we had on that meeting
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
when Glenn got you know tripped up with
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
this same legislation and we had a huge
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
meeting over there with all districts
 
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:00.620 align:start position:0%
participating including folks from doe
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember which district it
 
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:06.020 align:start position:0%
was it's down where Terry wolf came from
 
00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:09.299 align:start position:0%
and Bedford area and they had a
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
technician down there that was trying to
 
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
write this boilerplate for all school
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
districts that we could have that come
 
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
from there so that's my extent of it
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
without having my materials in front of
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
me I think the law was passed in 2016
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
maybe 2017. that's your your framework
 
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
but again I think there's the in-class
 
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.649 align:start position:0%
but again I think there's the in-class
recording

00:23:29.649 --> 00:23:29.659 align:start position:0%
recording
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
law and then what districts have created
 
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
policy Wise from there and so if we
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
start with finding the law
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
then we can reach out to the school
 
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:40.940 align:start position:0%
boards Association and see what their
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
boilerplate policy is and then it would
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
be up to this committee to decide from
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
there where if at all they want to go
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
with what information they want to
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah sure thank you the cordelli bill
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot about that uh chairman
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
Ladd and this is not anything like that
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
at all uh again uh for the umpteenth
 
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.529 align:start position:0%
at all uh again uh for the umpteenth
time

00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
um the gifted Bill the intent of that
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
was to raise awareness of a situation in
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
some districts where some gifted
 
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
students weren't being uh
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
so now that the gifted bill is law every
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
District it's on their radar screen and
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
by having to submit a report to doe that
 
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
requires the districts to at least you
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
know look at the issue there's no in
 
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
that case or neither in that case nor
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
this case is there any policy
 
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
requirement or spending mandate all it
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
is uh in this case is asking for uh
 
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
public information to be shared with doe
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
now as we're gifted the intent behind
 
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
this uh candidly is because we're in a
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
whole new world like years and years ago
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
the worst there was no such thing as
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
zoom we're on YouTube right now
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
so because largely because of covid when
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
we have all these uh new uh scenarios
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
with hybrid classes and recording and
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
questions about if who's watching at
 
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
home and uh can somebody uh you know
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
record I mean his privacy issues there
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
my antenna intent is not to address
 
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
those at all other than to raise
 
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
awareness that that uh these are new
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
issues that need attention in the best a
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
good way if not the best way to do that
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
is to uh through the requirement of a
 
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
report to dle uh that to share good
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
ideas and if they if there is some
 
00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
policy if some schools in this process
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
discover that they don't have policies
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
that are adequate then they can go to
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
this folder and see okay this school is
 
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
doing this and that's a good idea so we
 
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
can improve our policy by just comparing
 
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh what we have or don't have to what
 
00:25:59.409 --> 00:25:59.419 align:start position:0%
other schools are doing via this Central
 
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299 align:start position:0%
uh uh virtual folder if you will and
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
just like the gifted Bill very very
 
00:26:08.169 --> 00:26:08.179 align:start position:0%
simple so I I know I keep saying I I I
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
Reckless heading down into all kinds of
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
details and so is Dave and uh not where
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
I want to go or we need to go you know
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
basically do we want to have a report
 
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
requirement for recording policies the
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
way we did we gifted or not hand uh
 
00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
representative uh I was going to say
 
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
caught it representative Hall
 
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
okay um you keep saying and we all can
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
be as well as with the gifted case
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
do we know I guess an attorney do we
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
know how that has worked out do we know
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
like so if you're basing it on that
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that that was very
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
successful and I don't think that that's
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
really the case because it hasn't even
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
no that's that's what I'm saying but
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
basing on sure if we don't know the
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
effect of correct sure a good question
 
00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh in a fair fair question a gift that
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
just became law so there's really
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
nothing yet to compare it to until the
 
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
schools have time to to uh uh in fact
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
just going into effect this coming year
 
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
right so it's uh uh right I mean it is
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know but again it's just a uh uh a
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
folder of uh a photo to collect policies
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
as simple as that uh yes uh
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
representative like us
 
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
so if we ask for the public policy would
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
that then
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
eliminate the issue of safety and all of
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
that because we're only asking for their
 
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
already public policies I don't know how
 
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
to word that
 
00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
to to say you know
 
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
their General policy that like they
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
might even tell the parents or be on
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
their website or something like that as
 
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
opposed to their you know detailed this
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
is what we do for and we're just talking
 
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
about classroom monitoring
 
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.330 align:start position:0%
about classroom monitoring
and

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.970 align:start position:0%
and
right

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
I mean hallway monitoring and that kind
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
of stuff anyways that's not even oh sure
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
I mean there's all kinds of really
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
interesting uh details and scenarios
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
that we that we could get into uh we
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
don't want to here but if this comes
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
back in some form next year somehow
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
someway there are a lot of things that
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
really do need some discussion and
 
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
perhaps stats you don't really know uh
 
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
but if we have if if the schools
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
can share whatever their policies are in
 
00:28:39.049 --> 00:28:39.059 align:start position:0%
one place
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
um then that'll be a step in the right
 
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.350 align:start position:0%
um then that'll be a step in the right
direction

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
without a statutory requirement for
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
schools to
 
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:51.539 align:start position:0%
share their policies with doe
 
00:28:51.539 --> 00:28:52.250 align:start position:0%
share their policies with doe
um

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
some schools I don't think would do
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
anything wouldn't do much or whatever
 
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
and yes this is called before why
 
00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
doesn't Doh just uh issue a memo and say
 
00:29:02.649 --> 00:29:02.659 align:start position:0%
send us your information
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
the implementer the perimeter of
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
statutory action shows that this is like
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
an important it's not just some memo you
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
know send this to your
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
you know kindergarten numbers this is
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
potentially very important and so it
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
rates I think uh you know some sort of
 
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
Statute to underscore that this is an
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
area that uh you know people need to um
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
pay attention to
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
well trying to get into details uh sure
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative Blissfield thank you
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to ask
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
since not here before
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
um regarding the pot where we tried to
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
put some bills out there regarding
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
recordings in the schools and the
 
00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
classrooms and you mentioned that there
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
were an array of people that came to
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
speak on it are we talking
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
administrators teachers and staff or are
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
we talking parents because I think those
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
may be two very different viewpoints on
 
00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
this particular topic
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
sure another great question and and I'll
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
say the same thing they've said to other
 
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
uh points or comments that have come up
 
00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.269 align:start position:0%
uh points or comments that have come up
about

00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
um you know who's this involved as role
 
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
of parents or whatever uh great
 
00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
questions there's so many great
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
questions that need attention and uh so
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
that is something that would come out of
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
this if uh at some point next year or
 
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
whenever uh
 
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
we have this requirement that schools
 
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:34.740 align:start position:0%
organize their policies their public
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
policies and send them to to doe
 
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
um because of the statutory requirement
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%
I hope that helps somewhat yeah sure
 
00:30:45.419 --> 00:30:48.169 align:start position:0%
I hope that helps somewhat yeah sure
no

00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
I am curious still though who was it
 
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
that came that came out to those
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
meetings to speak to speak was it was it
 
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
school staff that don't want recordings
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
or was it parents that said my kids
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
won't be safe because from what I'm
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
hearing right now a lot of parents are
 
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
coming out and saying I want to see
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the school so I do I
 
00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
do I would like to know if if anybody
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
knows that um that's number one and then
 
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
number two
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
um if you don't mind kind of unpacking
 
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
this for me for all of us when we talk
 
00:31:18.899 --> 00:31:20.029 align:start position:0%
this for me for all of us when we talk
about

00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
um what would this look like for example
 
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
you're saying that a school sending a
 
00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
report can you give us a visualization
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
of how you think that might be broken
 
00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
down what a report might look like I
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not talking like you have to go
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
through 12 Pages worth but you know just
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
a simplified table of contents what
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
exactly are you thinking
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
sure if you're asking me my vision of it
 
00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.430 align:start position:0%
sure if you're asking me my vision of it
um

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
his attorney Fenn said again going back
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
to the gifted bill they did create a
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
template a helpful template to share
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
with the uh uh districts on how they
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
could submit whatever policies uh they
 
00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
had in the in the gifted area so to your
 
00:32:00.179 --> 00:32:01.610 align:start position:0%
had in the in the gifted area so to your
question

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
um if this if some version of this
 
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
requirement this reporting requirement
 
00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
requirement move forward uh I'm sure doe
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
would do the same thing they create some
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
sort of a template in this word that
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
they have an advisory or I think or
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
something like that that gives the
 
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:19.580 align:start position:0%
district's guidance in terms of how to
 
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
respond to a uh to a reporting request
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
um hopefully that helps a little bit
 
00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:31.130 align:start position:0%
um hopefully that helps a little bit
um

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
I know you're asking about for reporting
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
formats and what what might be in there
 
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.090 align:start position:0%
formats and what what might be in there
um

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.090 align:start position:0%
um
again

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
I think they could satisfy this by
 
00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.950 align:start position:0%
I think they could satisfy this by
simply

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh sending an email frankly I mean I
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too prescriptive
 
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
that's but I think that to respond to
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
the doe requests for a report on
 
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
recording policies and classroom
 
00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
observation policies
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
they could simply send an email to a
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
designated uh person or whatever At Doe
 
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
with attachments and here's our policies
 
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
and you can file them simple as that
 
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
Mike um
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking two different topics
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
right here within this bill in classroom
 
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.850 align:start position:0%
right here within this bill in classroom
recordings

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
recordings
 
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
and classroom observers right okay now
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'll take the ladder first the in
 
00:33:27.169 --> 00:33:27.179 align:start position:0%
classroom observers
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
um that comes down oftentimes yes you do
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
have a boilerplate policy on that New
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association has
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
to stop but then how you implement
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
within the school is going to be not
 
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
necessarily a policy but an
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
administrative guideline or
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
administrative dictate in the individual
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
School for example when I was a school
 
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
principal in elementary school we had
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
the policy where we didn't want to see a
 
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
lot of parents in school the first week
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
of school
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
especially when we're talking about
 
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
young children they're trying to break
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
away from parents it was a lot easier
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
for the teacher much easier to manage
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
and to try to get that degree in
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
Independence we had to get the
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
socialization skills going
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
we also had it within our policy or a
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
guideline it was more like a guideline
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
for us to follow because it was
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
administrative in nature that we when we
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
were giving the Statewide assessment and
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
we've been giving that all over the
 
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
country for years we didn't have
 
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
visitors during that at all that was
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
when parents were not welcome
 
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
um so if we're looking for this type of
 
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
information that's certainly available
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
through the individual schools that can
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
be done through a survey easily and and
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
gotten uh but uh there there's then you
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
get into The Observers that come in and
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
want to see okay what is our social
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
studies curriculum really like I want to
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
see that class talk
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
well it was just yesterday at the polls
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
I was talking to the new math teacher
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
down at Rivendell uh that's uh fairly
 
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Orford it's Interstate
 
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
government district and I said I'd like
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
to see what you're doing in mathematics
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
he's wow I'd love to see it come in the
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
classroom I'm going to talk with the you
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
know the folks in the sixth grade the
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
seventh and eighth some middle school
 
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.270 align:start position:0%
seventh and eighth some middle school
and

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
um it's a result of our all of us
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
knowing that we've we've seen slippage
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
since covet in mathematics and our kids
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
who've been out are sometimes down five
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
months six months and they're learning
 
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
and we're having to try to address how
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to accomplish that my school
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
districts I say U23 is going through a
 
00:35:40.849 --> 00:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
revision of the entire curriculum as a
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
result of that and purchasing a new
 
00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
program that's more aligned with with we
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
hope to get the analytics done so we can
 
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
get find out exactly where the holes are
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
in mathematics but be it as I spoke to
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
some earlier geometry or enumeration or
 
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
or some other aspect of learning so that
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have to replace the whole thing
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
but figure out where our weaknesses are
 
00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:04.140 align:start position:0%
so we can see the growth well he's
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
advised me that we'd love to see you
 
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
coming in the classroom and when when I
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
request to get in there and see that
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
from the perspective here we are in the
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
education committee looking they
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
welcomed us said you're welcome to come
 
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:20.220 align:start position:0%
in uh they they know that there's a real
 
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.140 align:start position:0%
good purpose to help growth and
 
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
Improvement uh now when you're coming
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
into to just look at it in terms of uh
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
are you teaching about George Washington
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
or Martin Luther King or whomever in
 
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
your history program or social studies
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
program Civics I think that's they
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
welcome that as well uh I think that
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
where the big concern would be is that
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
um if you're getting into certain
 
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:50.339 align:start position:0%
classes which are special service
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
classes uh you're getting the classes
 
00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
that are involving some youngsters you
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
may only have two or three kids in there
 
00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:00.740 align:start position:0%
or or you you we talk about
 
00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:02.579 align:start position:0%
confidentiality on the youth risk
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
behavior survey and represent Beaumont
 
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
say you have a school less than 10 kids
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
you can figure out who's taking the test
 
00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
just by the answers
 
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
you can see the names and all this stuff
 
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
too when you're in observing so they're
 
00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:15.500 align:start position:0%
going to be that level of
 
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
understanding and confidentiality so
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're in an area that I'd love to see
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff that I mentioned
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
earlier about when and how are people
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
welcome into the building we certainly
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
don't want people not welcomed and I
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
think that's where schools are as well
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
but there's got to be some conditions in
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
there too and
 
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
so that part I understand I'm having a
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
hard time though understanding when
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
we're getting into the the boilerplate
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
stuff which we've gone through and
 
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
representative durardelli it wasn't just
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
one bill it was several bills it was the
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
first bill which we made the errors on
 
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
and the second bill which had to correct
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
the errors and
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
um and I know that for a fact that's
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
what the policy is in all the schools
 
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
right now because that was the you know
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
that went through a lot of discussions
 
00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:04.140 align:start position:0%
through uh various groups and
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
organizations so
 
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
um I I think we're into a topic Mike
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to be it's very very
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
complex and I don't know if necessarily
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
a survey is going to give you everything
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
you want
 
00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
um I think you'd be wiser trying to seek
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
out some of the stuff from the school
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
boards Association and find out because
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
next week so what just happened here is
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
the beauty of what the intent of this
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
bill is okay which I think is really I
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
think is really cool so uh chairman Ladd
 
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
uh got into all these areas that I would
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
love to to discuss and talk about uh but
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's not the point of this bill if
 
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
this if some version next year would
 
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
have moved forward from this bill what
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
would happen in District after District
 
00:38:59.890 --> 00:38:59.900 align:start position:0%
would be because
 
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
districts and board members and
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
administrators and teachers and parents
 
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.050 align:start position:0%
administrators and teachers and parents
um

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
would see that there's a need to to just
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
send a report to doe they would sit down
 
00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
like we're doing here
 
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
um like Rick's and Dave and Alicia and
 
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
Melissa are you know
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
thinking about specific scenarios
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the beauty of this is that with no
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
Financial requirement no no spending no
 
00:39:29.329 --> 00:39:29.339 align:start position:0%
policy mandated spending or financial
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
spending Mandate of any sort
 
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
um this type of discussion will flow
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
forth uh everywhere that would not have
 
00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
happened otherwise and so holes and
 
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of holes in policies uh
 
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is not to have
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
any policy mandate is simply to get this
 
00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
on the radar screens of districts that
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
need to in this Brave New World with
 
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
with uh with the technology that it is
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh to address some of these issues that
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
Rick and others are thinking about but
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
that's not the point of this bill this
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
this measure is simply asking for a
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
report to Doe which will get it on
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
districts radar screens I know I'm
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
repeating myself but uh and again uh
 
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
this reminds me so much of the gifted
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill I keep going back to that but it's
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's the same uh concept and went to
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
interim study and and we get into Weeds
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
about what about this what about that
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
and and finally uh it came out of
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
interim study Mel voted for it and Mary
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
Gile and Barbershop you know it was very
 
00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:38.099 align:start position:0%
bipartisan they and Dan Wolfe and uh and
 
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
we've we've finally real people realize
 
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
we're not getting into policy we're just
 
00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:46.619 align:start position:0%
asking for a report that will be in
 
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
providing impetus for local discussion
 
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
where it needs to happen so but the
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
title of the bill says policy
 
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
I have it right here requiring reports
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
concerning school policies on classroom
 
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
recordings and in classroom observers
 
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
yes it's asking for a report of existing
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
public policies it's not mandating a
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
policy it's just asking to share what
 
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
you have in place
 
00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.230 align:start position:0%
you have in place
yeah

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
other others sure
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and you may
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
have said this earlier I apologize if I
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
missed it was there a specific situation
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
or experience that prompted you to move
 
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill
 
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
I I heard I mean I understand it's it's
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
um the gifted bill I understand that but
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious oftentimes I think
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
there's a personal experience or a
 
00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
constituent may come forward and that
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
kind of prompts us to say you know what
 
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
you're right let's take this further
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
great question I understand the question
 
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
and yeah so what prompted uh people uh
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
to talk to me and for me to follow up
 
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
um several things to one example would
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
be when there are remote classes in Via
 
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
Zoom or or whatever the platform is uh
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
you know privacy questions you know
 
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
people were saying so when students are
 
00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
watching classes remotely uh and they
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
can they record it
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
um or not and you know who's going to
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
watch are they going to be uh you know
 
00:42:21.069 --> 00:42:21.079 align:start position:0%
archived or what if the student
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
embarrasses himself or herself uh in
 
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
class that's remote that's recorded you
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
know uh I'm not saying what the policy
 
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
should be but you asked what was the
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
impetus behind uh Shining Light on this
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
is that help
 
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
and there's there's many many other I
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
could give that's one specific example
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh classroom observations
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh I mean I was a classroom teacher you
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
know and uh we there were policies about
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
if a parent wanted to come in but what
 
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
if when I was a teacher they didn't have
 
00:42:58.609 --> 00:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
these uh didn't have these things
 
00:43:02.109 --> 00:43:02.119 align:start position:0%
so that without
 
00:43:05.809 --> 00:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
suggesting any specific policy uh I
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
think there's a need to in terms of uh
 
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
classroom observations or visitations by
 
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
parents or whomever limiting it you know
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh can a parent uh
 
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
pull out this and record uh I don't know
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that well they should
 
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
have said that's a local decision but if
 
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
if something like this moves forward
 
00:43:28.849 --> 00:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
then you know it'll be addressed locally
 
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
where and it and it needs to be I mean
 
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
it's really important uh Rick and you
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
know asking for like a survey I've
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
already said this sure we could ask for
 
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
surveys but
 
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:41.339 align:start position:0%
um again to have something in statute
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
shows that this this is important that
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
this need to
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
they have some local conversations and
 
00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
and uh share what works it doesn't work
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
any anything else well I I do know that
 
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned one point that uh it's
 
00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
kind of interesting to me too is your
 
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
cell phone uh that is opening up a whole
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
Arena now of of uh opening at the
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
classroom to that and and I just talked
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
just the other day again with one of our
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
Junior High grandkids
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
and you know and he's really upset the
 
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
girls in the class can have the cell
 
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
phones the boys can't you know and and
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
of course that's coming from a Junior
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
High kid uh and uh some are using them
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
some are not and and so it it it's
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
different I guess in every school and if
 
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
you want to have some consistency within
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
the school that's up to that school
 
00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
staff to sit down with their parent
 
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
advisory Council or with the school
 
00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:41.099 align:start position:0%
board and try and figure that one out I
 
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
know there I've been in some schools
 
00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:44.099 align:start position:0%
where they you know just don't let them
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
take their cell phones out during the
 
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
instructional phase of the class and I I
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
think that's what should be done you
 
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
know as a librarian you don't want
 
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
somebody in there messing with their
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
phone when you're trying to talk about
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
you know the literature you're trying to
 
00:44:59.450 --> 00:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
you know the general you're trying to
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
get into so there are needs for common
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
basic policies in that Arena and and
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
that if this bill is going to gather us
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
that information I I applaud it yeah uh
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
because we do need to have you know I'm
 
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
sure teachers are looking for support on
 
00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
this one as well well because it becomes
 
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
a disc of the primary discipline plenary
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
issue for them when they have to keep
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
saying to you know a little Deb over
 
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
here hey dad put it away put it away if
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
not you're going to go down see Mr
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
principal right here
 
00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
um and and so but every school is
 
00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:35.180 align:start position:0%
different on that you know
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
exactly like when you just said Thank
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
you and again when Rick was getting or
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
chairman ladders getting into the
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
scenario the cell phones I mean that's
 
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
really interesting and important stuff
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
that needs to be talked about I'd love
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
to debate it here that's not again I I
 
00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:52.700 align:start position:0%
apologize for paying myself but I think
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
Rex helping now finally to shine a light
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
on this very simple simple intent of
 
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
this measure which is just to get an
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
important very pardon me very very
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
important uh uh
 
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
issue on the radar screens so that the
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
districts can have overdue discussions
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
some are ahead of others uh
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
send the uh would it be easier than Mike
 
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
to say here's a survey do you have a
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
policy or an administrative guideline in
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
your school regarding a use of cell
 
00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:26.579 align:start position:0%
phones in the classroom are kids allowed
 
00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
to have it they'll say I have to call my
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
parent my parents are going to call me I
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
have a doctor's appointment so that you
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
know and it's going to change during the
 
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
course of the day and I need to know
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
when that is
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
um so I don't want to talk about cell
 
00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:40.220 align:start position:0%
phones in here today
 
00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
that's reporting recording and all that
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
stuff as well yes and so that's the
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
beauty of this bill is is this What's
 
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
Happening Here is uh you know there's
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
discussions that need to happen and so
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
without getting into specific policies I
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
mean I have ideas about cell phones I'd
 
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
love to share that's not what this is
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
above this this is about uh providing an
 
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
impetus for this discussion to happen in
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
places where it might not have otherwise
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:14.339 align:start position:0%
representative Litchfield okay I might
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
move down a few seats I'm afraid to ask
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
you're getting passionate here I have a
 
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:20.220 align:start position:0%
question for you in a good way by the
 
00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
way I I admire it
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
um my question to you is when you're
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
talking about this and you're talking
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
about these conversations that are going
 
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
to happen and and I can see the more
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I can see what
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
you're saying that there's there are all
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
these policies out there and really who
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
really does sit down and kind of put it
 
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
all together right they're just out
 
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
there you're right I'm in that policy
 
00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.050 align:start position:0%
there you're right I'm in that policy
manual

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
manual
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
um my question is where where do you
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
envision these conversations happening
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
would it be do you think at the at the
 
00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
administrative level because if it is
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors I don't know how
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
much it would benefit the public or the
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
parents whereas if it was that let's say
 
00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
a school board meeting I think that
 
00:47:59.089 --> 00:47:59.099 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful actually so I'm
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
just curious sure sure another great
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
question is so where do I where do we
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
envision these conversations taking
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
place uh the answer is I'm not exactly
 
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
sure uh every district is every culture
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
every school has some real culture so if
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
this if some version of this uh next
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
year would come to this committee and
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
and uh and come out of this committee
 
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
asking for a report to doe then the
 
00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
school districts the sau's uh would get
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
a memo or or a message from doe saying
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
please up by this date send us a report
 
00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh sharing your public policies on
 
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
classroom visitations and recording
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
procedures whatever
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
so uh Melissa what what I think would
 
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
happen I'm sure uh whether it's as I
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
said before school board members parents
 
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
faculty administrators whomever uh
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
having a uh a meeting
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
um talking about cell phones and talking
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
about coming to class I I and out of
 
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
that locally uh there will be different
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
policies that need to be in place some
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
places are ahead of others in terms of
 
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
this braver world of cell phones and
 
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
zooms and and visits and recording and
 
00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:17.819 align:start position:0%
privacy uh
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
so I just trust the localities to just
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
come together and have this discussion
 
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
and come up with policies that need to
 
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
be in place and if if some really
 
00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
interesting uh if one District comes up
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
with some interesting uh
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
scenario that nobody else had thought of
 
00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
then and they share that then then by
 
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
sharing all these things it helps
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
everybody to get to to better places to
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
come up with policies that work locally
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
sure am I missing something I mean we've
 
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.109 align:start position:0%
sure am I missing something I mean we've
got

00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
um we've got the School Board
 
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
Association where school board members
 
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
get together and talk about things we've
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
got the school administrators
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
Association that hold
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I think at least monthly meetings the
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
southwesters the different areas where
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
superintendents and Senior
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
Administration get together talk about
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
things have speakers to come in and talk
 
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
about certain things we've got
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
um there's principles Association I
 
00:50:20.329 --> 00:50:20.339 align:start position:0%
believe where principals get together
 
00:50:22.609 --> 00:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
and just two days ago or several days
 
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
ago he's you and I attended the special
 
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
education Administration Association
 
00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:29.339 align:start position:0%
right so I guess I don't know what I'm
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
missing if if this is such a big issue
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
either at the school board level the
 
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
administration level the principles
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
level the special education level
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
um there seems to be lots of opportunity
 
00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
for uh already for um um for for school
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
leaders to get together and discuss
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
things and figure out where how how to
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
how to proceed with it and really
 
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
understand what the impact is one of one
 
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
of the difficulties I'm having here Mike
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
is that is that we're not we're during
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
this study we're not actually hearing
 
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
from from you know people like Jane
 
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
Bergeron or Carl Ladd or Dean cascaden
 
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
or you know or you know or or you know
 
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.010 align:start position:0%
or you know or you know or or you know
um

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
or others
 
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
um you know in this area and and and you
 
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
know I I you know I agree completely
 
00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
with what with what Rick saying that
 
00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:32.339 align:start position:0%
that this is a very complicated area
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
that that potentially affects and
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
impacts a lot of different things I mean
 
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
if I'm if I'm the parent of a special
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
education student
 
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
um I already know that in small
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
districts the department is protecting
 
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
my students identity from being exposed
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
to um to members of the community who
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
later on in March may be voting on
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
budgets and um
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure that that this that any
 
00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:05.099 align:start position:0%
of these policies would necessarily
 
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
protect my interests as a parent of a
 
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
special education student particularly
 
00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
as it relates to in classroom
 
00:52:11.579 --> 00:52:13.309 align:start position:0%
as it relates to in classroom
observation

00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
observation
 
00:52:13.319 --> 00:52:14.030 align:start position:0%
observation
um

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
um I agree that that that a lot of
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
conversation has to be had around it but
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think all of a sudden creating a
 
00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:24.059 align:start position:0%
big pile of what's in place right now is
 
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
where that starts
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
um uh so I'm just putting it out there
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
that that I've got a lot of concerns
 
00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:33.740 align:start position:0%
about uh about accumulating information
 
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
in policies that may or may not be
 
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
already required by the um by the by the
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
state and and I I mean all right I'm I'm
 
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
not going to be a I'm not a fact witness
 
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
to the education committee none of us
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
really are supposed to be that but but I
 
00:52:53.569 --> 00:52:53.579 align:start position:0%
think at least in many of our
 
00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
experiences on school boards in
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
administration realize that the school
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
boards Association has a lot more model
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
policies than are required by the by the
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so um so I just
 
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
want to leave it at that that I think
 
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
there's there's sufficient concern she
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
sure and to your point about you
 
00:53:14.809 --> 00:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
mentioned Carl Ladd or the different
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
associations and all these the folks and
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
and structures that are in place uh with
 
00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.530 align:start position:0%
and structures that are in place uh with
that

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
what would this do to that again uh for
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
the empty time I go back to the bill of
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
the law that this is modeled on which is
 
00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
a gifted law I will tell you that many
 
00:53:34.609 --> 00:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
many many schools and we'll find out
 
00:53:36.049 --> 00:53:36.059 align:start position:0%
better as this information comes in
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing little or nothing in this
 
00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
area where they probably should and now
 
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
they will because there's a new statute
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
a new law that requires schools to pay
 
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
attention to an area that deserves
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
attention so some of the similar to this
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
I am conf I'm sure uh clearly is you you
 
00:53:59.569 --> 00:53:59.579 align:start position:0%
keep saying it's very complicated and as
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
chairman laddin says it's complicated
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
well if it's complicated then there's a
 
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
need for localities to pay attention to
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
this and address some of these
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
complexities and come up with some
 
00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
policies that uh clear I think clearly
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
need to be uh in place and through
 
00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
statute uh that it means something you
 
00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:23.339 align:start position:0%
know if education committee or the house
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
says this is important enough for us to
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
ask that you uh have a discussion about
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
it and share your policy uh in a central
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
location only Greg I think can come out
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
of communication and discussion
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
uh okay I I know it's almost three
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
somebody and I'm going to be looking for
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
the motion of some sort whether to uh
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
um support this concept for future uh
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
possible legislation or not
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
um but representative Moffett may I just
 
00:54:58.809 --> 00:54:58.819 align:start position:0%
follow please
 
00:55:02.349 --> 00:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
so the statute in question is RSA 189
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
and so again 189 colon 68 and it's
 
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
paragraphs 3 4 and 5 which deal with in
 
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
classroom recording
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
those were passed in 2015 and 2016
 
00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
respectively so representative lad and I
 
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
got the dates right which is a miracle
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
that rarely happens on my part at least
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
I will not read it to this committee it
 
00:55:32.569 --> 00:55:32.579 align:start position:0%
is rather lengthy but you can refer to
 
00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:35.099 align:start position:0%
that statute and that's where it talks
 
00:55:35.099 --> 00:55:36.170 align:start position:0%
that statute and that's where it talks
about

00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
the in classroom recording piece of it
 
00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:42.260 align:start position:0%
sure and thank you and I point out that
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
2015-2016 predates the you know the
 
00:55:49.089 --> 00:55:49.099 align:start position:0%
covid uh pandemic which
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
created some some new scenarios that
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
that you know some of us think would
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
need attention
 
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.290 align:start position:0%
need attention
um

00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
it is a period of time now referred to
 
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:02.220 align:start position:0%
as before the pandemic right and then
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
there's during the pandemic and after
 
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
the pandemic so yes it is before the
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic yeah our post pandemic World
 
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.630 align:start position:0%
pandemic yeah our post pandemic World
Mike

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.950 align:start position:0%
Mike
um

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
I've been visiting a number of
 
00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
elementary schools just the other day I
 
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
was up at the Landau School prior to
 
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
that the number over in Vermont and I
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
was surprised when we walked over
 
00:56:24.049 --> 00:56:24.059 align:start position:0%
Vermont and wanted to go into school
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
welcome you're in the school at the the
 
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
some of that pandemic stuff which we all
 
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
encountered that you couldn't even get
 
00:56:32.329 --> 00:56:32.339 align:start position:0%
in a school you had to knock and leave
 
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
the stuff off for the kid outside and
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
they came to the door and greeted you
 
00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
and I know there's a number of
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
disgruntled folks wanting to get in and
 
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
see instruction because it was a time of
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
Awakening for many parents here's what's
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
being taught in school and perhaps I
 
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
agree or perhaps I don't agree with
 
00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:53.579 align:start position:0%
what's going on and so you want in
 
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
what is the policy for getting in and
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
observing a classroom might be what
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
we're looking at but it I I would say
 
00:57:00.599 --> 00:57:01.970 align:start position:0%
we're looking at but it I I would say
that

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
we are returning and I I see it
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
happening right now today I can go to
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
many of the schools and I'm welcome
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
walking right in they say hello come on
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
in uh but if this happened uh last year
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
or the year before I wouldn't have been
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
welcomed in those schools so
 
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to be pre trying to
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
go back to what is so-called normal now
 
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
what is normal
 
00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:29.220 align:start position:0%
um it may be different from school to
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
school and again it's about the
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
leadership in the building it's about
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
the school boards in that district and
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
how they what their attitude is uh and I
 
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
don't know if we're ever going to change
 
00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.750 align:start position:0%
don't know if we're ever going to change
that

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
um do the fact we have elected officials
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
just as we are running those schools and
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
they're in charge of curriculum and
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
instruction and it's a local Affair it's
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
a local responsibility I think the way
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
we're going to really change access to
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
schools is from a local perspective a
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
parent saying I'd like to be able to get
 
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
in now if if that's the problem they
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
can't get in and observe a classroom
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're being told no you're not welcome
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
in there then we have we have a problem
 
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to address that so I
 
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
I'm I guess I'm really am because having
 
00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:14.579 align:start position:0%
a difficult time understanding because
 
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
we do have policies I can remember that
 
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
hot debate we had back in 2015 and 6 16
 
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
and it went and went in two years and
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
um and now we're trying to find all
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
cakes submit your stuff so that we can
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
find out what's going on let's find the
 
00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
best practices and share that with
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
everybody else is that not being done
 
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
through the school boards Association
 
00:58:35.569 --> 00:58:35.579 align:start position:0%
now I don't know
 
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
but they do have these boilerplates
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
which they you know give everybody just
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
like the municipal government give
 
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
select boards and city councils that
 
00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:45.470 align:start position:0%
select boards and city councils that
information

00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
sure okay
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of a three-parter so it's a
 
00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
little disjointed um
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
I do want to say that I know this is
 
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
going to impact many different people in
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
their large concerns about the different
 
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
groups that will impact
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
um and I there's no other way to say it
 
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
so I mean it with the best of intentions
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
not in a combative way
 
00:59:17.329 --> 00:59:17.339 align:start position:0%
but this has been posted the internal
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
study twice now and I wonder if would
 
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
adverse the impact or if groups if this
 
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
is a Hot Topic that they were that
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
passionate about it wouldn't they be
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
here right now or is that not typical
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
with an interim study that's my first
 
00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:31.970 align:start position:0%
with an interim study that's my first
question

00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
well it's a published a meeting
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and people I suspect there are a few
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
are probably watching now or can watch
 
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
later to hear our discussion on on this
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
so just that's my that's what I'm
 
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
wondering if it's that controversial we
 
00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
might be able to address uh you've got
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
an interim study thing about meeting
 
00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
where you sent out an email to
 
00:59:52.619 --> 00:59:54.170 align:start position:0%
where you sent out an email to
certain

00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
um experts
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
to come to the meeting well we've done
 
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
that with a number of people that's what
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
that's yeah that's what we do and uh for
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
example we have an internal study that's
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's coming up
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with well it's not interim
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
study necessarily but we have the the
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee that's
 
01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:15.059 align:start position:0%
scheduled around the block here and
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking at uh
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
contacted doe and we know we're going to
 
01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:21.299 align:start position:0%
have some very important people there we
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
did the same thing with teacher shortage
 
01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
just a few days ago
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
um and we had uh you know not a full
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
house we only had maybe five or six
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
people in attendance there
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
um you're not going to get a lot of
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
attendance during interim studies it's
 
01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:38.420 align:start position:0%
just the history of the planet here
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
summertime people are gone and we're
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
right now in September and you know most
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
folks right about now are back at school
 
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
picking kids up at the door
 
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
um it's it's uh that time of year when
 
01:00:54.289 --> 01:00:54.299 align:start position:0%
we're going through a change I in the
 
01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
past when we've had interim studies when
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
Pat's mineral studies and concussion and
 
01:00:59.809 --> 01:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
all that years ago we had people coming
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
in and and participating because it was
 
01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:04.859 align:start position:0%
an issue that was of concern and needed
 
01:01:04.859 --> 01:01:06.250 align:start position:0%
an issue that was of concern and needed
address

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:06.260 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
this one may need address but I
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
certainly you know I don't see the
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
people attending it
 
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
um so and I know you have a couple
 
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
follow-ups uh again uh this is not
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
getting into anything that they glendid
 
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
years ago this is simply uh saying uh
 
01:01:26.809 --> 01:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
we'd like to have you submit a report
 
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
with your public information I don't
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
want to don't not looking to get into uh
 
01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
debates on specific policies or cell
 
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
phones or anything else uh again I know
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'm repeating myself and I apologize but
 
01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:44.579 align:start position:0%
um I it it took it took a while with the
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
gifted Bill uh to go through interim
 
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
study and and I'm having flashbacks
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
because with their own study with gifted
 
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd we were getting getting
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
all these questions about we gotta do
 
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
this or do that and about this or about
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
that and all that all that was finally
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
you know uh folks figured out uh it's
 
01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
just a report and it's a report that'll
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
help people to pay attention to
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
something needs to be paid attention to
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
and so it's a lot and I I feel great
 
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
about that because I'm sure that all
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
kinds of good things are now going to
 
01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
happen in terms of discussion about
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
neglected gifted students and in this
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
case it's the the same it's that's the
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
model for this uh if we ask for the
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
reports on this important area then the
 
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
local discussion will take place I to me
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
it's very very simple and uh
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
and I think we're making it more
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
complicated than than we need to but uh
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
unless you had some follow-ups right
 
01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:47.339 align:start position:0%
I I just the other
 
01:02:47.339 --> 01:02:48.349 align:start position:0%
I I just the other
um

01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:51.049 --> 01:02:51.059 align:start position:0%
comment that I had was I know that there
 
01:02:52.609 --> 01:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
are several groups that probably could
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
address this principles right
 
01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
um After School Board Association you're
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
talking about the superintendent
 
01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.870 align:start position:0%
talking about the superintendent
Association

01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.650 align:start position:0%
Association
um

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
you've heard me talk about this before I
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
have grave concerns and if we bring up
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire School Board
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
Association because it is a lobbying
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
group they have hundreds of thousands in
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
their bank account I've researched it
 
01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
I've seen it so if parents want to look
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
at those policies that they have we're
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
talking about they have a wide array I
 
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
don't know that we have access to them
 
01:03:21.049 --> 01:03:21.059 align:start position:0%
as parents
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
um you have to pay what is it a couple
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or it might even be
 
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
dependent upon your student population
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
per head
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
um to be a part of that I don't know
 
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
that as a general public we have access
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
um I do like the idea of this
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
information being put in the centralized
 
01:03:41.329 --> 01:03:41.339 align:start position:0%
location I've even had parents come to
 
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
me with concerns now that policies are
 
01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
being stored electronically have these
 
01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
policies been changed without people
 
01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
even realizing it and whether it's valid
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
or not I don't know but I've had parents
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
bring it to me I like the idea of this
 
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
being on centralized I like the idea of
 
01:03:59.690 --> 01:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
us kind of wiping the dust off and
 
01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
taking a look at it
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
um I personally would like to um to
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
support representative Moffett in his
 
01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
Endeavor so with that being said um I
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
would like to make a motion to move
 
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
I'll second that
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
sort of a motion to recommend that we
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
move forward with the simple
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we support the
 
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
okay further comments discussion on the
 
01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.329 align:start position:0%
okay further comments discussion on the
motion

01:04:44.329 --> 01:04:44.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:48.380 align:start position:0%
okay if not uh let me look at our
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
assigned folks here
 
01:04:54.049 --> 01:04:54.059 align:start position:0%

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:39.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.880 --> 01:15:05.110 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
all right folks uh I think it was six
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
minutes whatever it was but uh I know
 
01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
everybody's time is valuable attorney
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
Fen is in the house and will soon be out
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
of the house so we want to utilize her
 
01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:19.340 align:start position:0%
expertise in experience in addressing
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
we need a policy on cell phones
 
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
I I I like that power off okay
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
but we need to decide you know who
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
manages the fund and uh what's it used
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
for so anyway so now we're talking about
 
01:15:44.209 --> 01:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
uh HB
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
12 25. here it is
 
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
we just said 12.95 so we're talking
 
01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:52.189 align:start position:0%
we just said 12.95 so we're talking
about

01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
I have over here yeah 1676 and that has
 
01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
to do with incentive grants so before
 
01:15:59.330 --> 01:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton leaves
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
um thing if you could uh it's a very
 
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
simple Bill you've been here before it
 
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
had a house a Committee hearing had
 
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
we've already had one interim study
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
hearing so you know the the Simplicity
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
of the concept we want to give doe a
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
fund to award achievement so if you
 
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
could speak to doe dealing with such a
 
01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:20.590 align:start position:0%
could speak to doe dealing with such a
concept

01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
concept
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record my name is
 
01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
Diana Fenton I'm an attorney with the
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I apologize that
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
I have to make my Hasty Retreat for a 3
 
01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
30 with uh the commissioner so we can
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
blame this on Frank uh as I blame all my
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
problems um
 
01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.630 align:start position:0%
problems um
so

01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
based on the concept that you have
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
explained to me
 
01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
um it is a Department's position that
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
this could be best fulfilled by giving
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
the department rule making Authority
 
01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.910 align:start position:0%
the department rule making Authority
so

01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
in technical terms you'll find
 
01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:53.780 align:start position:0%
rulemaking in
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
541-a that's the statute that covers
 
01:16:59.209 --> 01:16:59.219 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and when you look at the
 
01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
various statutes that comprise education
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
some of them re require the department
 
01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
to go into rule making so for example in
 
01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
last session uh the bill for
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
co-curricular co-curricular activities
 
01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
grants which I know representative
 
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
moffatt was a part of Representative
 
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
Mullen was a part of that bill it was
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
interesting that that bill gave the
 
01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.570 align:start position:0%
interesting that that bill gave the
department

01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
um it was it wasn't mandatory rulemaking
 
01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:29.219 align:start position:0%
it was optional and typically you see
 
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
mandatory rulemaking and it's in rule
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
making that the department flushes out
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
the details of the statute so a great
 
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
example of that would be Innovation
 
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
schools which was passed then a past
 
01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
legislative session the department has
 
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
entered into rule making on that efas
 
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
the department went into rulemaking on
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
that but that rulemaking has to be in
 
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
we cannot we the department cannot just
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily go into rule making it has
 
01:17:58.490 --> 01:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.090 align:start position:0%
to be
um

01:17:59.090 --> 01:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
allowed for required in the statute so
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
if it is this legislative body's
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
intention to have a somewhat simple and
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
I use that word lightly simple statute
 
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
that gives the department authority to
 
01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:17.659 align:start position:0%
create this program then in order to
 
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
facilitate that the department would
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
need rule making authority to to do that
 
01:18:24.169 --> 01:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions as
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
it pertains to that
 
01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:27.659 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney fence so let me
 
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
follow up then you mentioned the
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
co-curricular bill which is now law I
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
was the original sponsor that and that's
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
another bill that went to interim study
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
if you were called it was initially
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
Unified sports spell went to interim
 
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
study uh whoops have Lang took it over
 
01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative so it had a long journey
 
01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:47.699 align:start position:0%
now it's wild so you mentioned
 
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
rulemaking to implement that with
 
01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
through doe my question is
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
is the structure that is in place for
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
rule making that you used and that we
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
used to implement the co-curricular bill
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
can that same structure be used for this
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
proposed bill or do you need some new uh
 
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
language for rule making so the idea
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
behind the co-curricular bill was really
 
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
based upon the robotics Grant Bill which
 
01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:19.460 align:start position:0%
passed before the pandemic
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
2019-2020 and so the idea behind those
 
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
two bills was to give the department
 
01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
about fifty thousand dollars I know
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars was the
 
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
co-curricular amount and then the
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
department would then disperse grants
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
upon application uh up to four thousand
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
dollars for for certain things and
 
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
co-curricular it's uniforms and
 
01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:39.470 align:start position:0%
co-curricular it's uniforms and
equipment

01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
and there are certain criteria that go
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
with those grants and that is the school
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
districts can apply for it or they don't
 
01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
have to apply for it so I think the
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
structure in implementing the idea
 
01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:53.219 align:start position:0%
before us here would be a little
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
different it's it's not something you
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
would necessarily apply for it would be
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
awarded to but it would be awarded based
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
on certain criteria
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
and it's that criteria and the amount
 
01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
and kind of the rules by which the
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
department would would work within that
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
would be facilitated best by rulemaking
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
another great example of when we used
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
our rulemaking Authority I always go
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
back to it was representative lad's code
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
of conduct bill the code of conduct law
 
01:20:23.689 --> 01:20:23.699 align:start position:0%
is very brief
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
it just sets out four principles and
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
then it was a Department's
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
responsibility pursuant to rulemaking to
 
01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
fully flush those principles out as to
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
what this looks what this looks like and
 
01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
how the department will proceed uh
 
01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
within those within that structure and
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's really what I if I understand
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
your intention that's really what this
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
legislative body is is requesting
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
and so it would be rulemaking that would
 
01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
allow the department to act within those
 
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
rules and that way it's not arbitrary
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
that was very clear to everyone what the
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
rules are what the department looks at
 
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
what the criteria is it's not subjective
 
01:21:05.209 --> 01:21:05.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you so the 1676 is it came to us
 
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh it was a fiscal note uh I had to do
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
the million dollars
 
01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
the some version of this manifest itself
 
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
and comes forward the next year
 
01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:20.149 align:start position:0%
and comes forward the next year
um

01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
looking at what is the language in the
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
initial proposal
 
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is that you'd like to
 
01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
see some better language that addresses
 
01:21:31.330 --> 01:21:31.340 align:start position:0%
the need for
 
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
rules that Doe would need to see to
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
implement this word ever to become law
 
01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
the bill at least had better language re
 
01:21:41.699 --> 01:21:43.430 align:start position:0%
the bill at least had better language re
rules

01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
I think in order to facilitate the
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
intention of the bill the department
 
01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
would need to create rules to facilitate
 
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
it and in order for the Department to
 
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
enter into rulemaking we need rule
 
01:21:58.450 --> 01:21:58.460 align:start position:0%
making authority pursuant to RSA 541-a
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
in its simplest form
 
01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and unless comment would
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
be depending upon who gets reelected or
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
who's in the mix next year and and what
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
if anything along these lines moves
 
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
forward uh you or doe would certainly I
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
would think be available to talk to
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
sponsors on coming up with the language
 
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.870 align:start position:0%
sponsors on coming up with the language
that

01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
would help to move it forward from Doe's
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
perspective right absolutely
 
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's a comfort thank you
 
01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a comfort sometimes it's
 
01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:32.090 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a comfort sometimes it's
not

01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
questions uh represent Bruno thank you
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
Mike so um you know I know we haven't
 
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
had a whole lot of Opera well we've had
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity but maybe not much sex
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
success with uh putting forward or
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
working together in a bipartisan way to
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
to develop policies that that actually
 
01:22:52.729 --> 01:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
have some stick-to-itiveness in the um
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
um you know in the law and obviously you
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
know the results in November as you were
 
01:22:58.610 --> 01:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
alluding to will certainly have an
 
01:23:00.649 --> 01:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
effect on on what happens next session
 
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
but uh I would I would offer that if you
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
were looking for some durable success
 
01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
with with this that we consider
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
um uh reorganizing it a little bit I
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
think it's backwards
 
01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how some districts like
 
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester are going to be able to
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
somehow magically do something that
 
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
improves student outcomes in such a way
 
01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:26.219 align:start position:0%
that then they'll be able to get a fifty
 
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar reward I would suggest
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
that that the grant be based on
 
01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
on school districts submitting an
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
application and a proposal and those
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
proposals be vetted by the department
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the winning proposals be awarded
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars to improve
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
Student Success and um and you know I
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
think we could probably get more more
 
01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support uh if it was
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I I hear you and and uh
 
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
um again I don't know if I'll be around
 
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
after this month or who's going to be in
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
the mix but which you describe uh is
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
intriguing to me
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I know attorney fensley is leaving
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.239 --> 01:24:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:20.450 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
yeah so to to what you just said uh
 
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
David yeah I mean uh that is intriguing
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
if I think what we need to do today
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
is decide whether or not the the notion
 
01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
of creating a million dollar fund or
 
01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
whatever the the language and and uh
 
01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
1676 is for a million dollars
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
we need and I'll be looking for some
 
01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
sort of uh Motion in the in a rope on
 
01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:53.750 align:start position:0%
sort of uh Motion in the in a rope on
uh

01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.330 align:start position:0%
uh
1676

01:24:56.330 --> 01:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
1676
 
01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:57.290 align:start position:0%
1676
um

01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
so that we can either endorse the
 
01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
concept or the notion of uh rewarding
 
01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.850 align:start position:0%
concept or the notion of uh rewarding
achievement

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
and then incentive to the full committee
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
and then and then see what out of that
 
01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
we might try to put together for uh an
 
01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.890 align:start position:0%
we might try to put together for uh an
LSR

01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
LSR
 
01:25:18.169 --> 01:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
yeah so so um so I think you
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted what I suggested
 
01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
um um what what I'm suggesting is not
 
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
rewarding achievement but actually a
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant process to encourage
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
achievement and so um so districts would
 
01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
submit proposals saying here's what
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to do to uh to what what it
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
here's what we're going to do to affect
 
01:25:45.649 --> 01:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
an improvement in student outcomes on
 
01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
the and I forget what the I I was
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
looking at a second ago the standardized
 
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
tests or the the state um you know
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
assessment exam or graduation rates or
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to measure and um uh
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
and then it would be like I said it
 
01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
would be a competitive
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
um uh Grant process the grant the grant
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
applications would be reviewed by the
 
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
department winners would be selected
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
um uh for awards and uh and then would
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
receive the award
 
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
um to be used to put towards that um uh
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
that initiative so the model you
 
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
described if if a proposal is put
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
together that has a metric and the
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
proposal that your school comes up with
 
01:26:30.890 --> 01:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
says we propose uh to try these things
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
in order to improve our uh standardized
 
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
pick an assessment whatever yeah yeah
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
whatever representative Hopson I
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
actually met with some Folks At Doe and
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
Caitlin Davis had some ideas as to what
 
01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.250 align:start position:0%
Caitlin Davis had some ideas as to what
assessments

01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
um they might recommend I I don't need
 
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
to get in the ways as to which
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
assessments but my question to you is uh
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
so my comment to you is what I'm hearing
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
a proposal generated locally that had
 
01:27:05.169 --> 01:27:05.179 align:start position:0%
metrics for improvement
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
were those metrics to be achieved then
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible for uh some money
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
no that's not what I said okay so what I
 
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
said is the proposal would would be
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
submitted the proposal would be would be
 
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
judged based on what the what whatever
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
the Department's criteria is for um for
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
improving Student Success the grant
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
would be awarded to those those winning
 
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
app like those those in a competitive
 
01:27:36.649 --> 01:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
application process the fifty thousand
 
01:27:38.209 --> 01:27:38.219 align:start position:0%
dollar Grant would then go to the
 
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
schools and then the school could use
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
that 50 000 Grant dollar Grant to fund
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
the proposal to um to uh to meet the
 
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
objective outcome okay so I think we're
 
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
we're getting a better understanding of
 
01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
how we're looking at this so what I'm
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
hearing from you is
 
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
that you do not expect a metric to be
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
met in order for the the money would
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
come in in response to a good plan and
 
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
then they would get the reward the award
 
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
correct award is on the plan award to
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
fund the plan as opposed to a reward for
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh meeting a metric okay so all right so
 
01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
the order of operations okay uh
 
01:28:22.739 --> 01:28:24.350 align:start position:0%
the order of operations okay uh
representative

01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
we've been kind of doing that all along
 
01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:29.540 align:start position:0%
is giving money and hoping the schools
 
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
have a plan and use it and we gave a
 
01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of extra money last year
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
specifically for them to be able to and
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
we asked for them to put in plans and
 
01:28:44.209 --> 01:28:44.219 align:start position:0%
give reports and everything on how that
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
money gets used
 
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
you're putting that out there else could
 
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
you cite what that is because I'm not
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
aware of what you're connecting that to
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
what was the that at the end of the year
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
we did
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
um no that's there's the there's the
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs extraordinary that
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
hasn't even started yet that hasn't
 
01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
started right I'm just saying that we
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
yes we've instituted that this is a
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
completely different a completely
 
01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.139 align:start position:0%
different focus and means of getting
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
change because what we want is
 
01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
Improvement right and so according to
 
01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
that we're giving money to the schools
 
01:29:23.950 --> 01:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
and they're supposed to have a plan and
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully they will improve and this is
 
01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
the opposite and it's intentionally the
 
01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:32.219 align:start position:0%
opposite to say you improve we're going
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
to reward you for that and we've got the
 
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
one that you're talking about basically
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
I mean it's not a it the money's already
 
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
there it's been given for people to
 
01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:45.050 align:start position:0%
there it's been given for people to
improve

01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
improve
 
01:29:48.169 --> 01:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
I think we need to have a multi-faceted
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
approach and this is one we haven't
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
tried yet we've been putting money out
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
and putting money out so let's reward
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
instead for because when somebody goes
 
01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
they get rewarded for how they do right
 
01:30:05.689 --> 01:30:05.699 align:start position:0%
and they get a raise for doing better
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
and that's the way people work they work
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
on incentives and they work
 
01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.689 align:start position:0%
on incentives and they work
um

01:30:11.689 --> 01:30:11.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's the nature of humans and
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh representative Hall yeah I
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
just thought to Alicia when they say
 
01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to have a plan
 
01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh what Dave is saying is they do have a
 
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
plan they can't supposed to they're
 
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
going to submit a plan before they get
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
any money so we it's not like they're
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
going to get the money and then maybe
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
they'll plan it out or not so there is a
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
I realized that that was part of that
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
extra money whatever the extreme needs
 
01:30:51.890 --> 01:30:51.900 align:start position:0%
grant that we put in they have to put in
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
a plan they have to um have in the plan
 
01:30:59.209 --> 01:30:59.219 align:start position:0%
ways of evaluating and they have to
 
01:31:01.729 --> 01:31:01.739 align:start position:0%
report back how it did that's in that
 
01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
that's we've done that this is something
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
different this is so that we have a
 
01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
two-pronged approach to the same problem
 
01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
let's give both things the opportunity
 
01:31:14.110 --> 01:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
to succeed
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative like I say
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'm tracking you
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
um let me just say this and we've said
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
this before as we all know we give a lot
 
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
of money to schools that have deficient
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
third grade reading scores okay that's
 
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
that's part of the funding mechanism
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
that we have in New Hampshire
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I understand that we understand you
 
01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
know schools show they're struggling
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
with teaching reading so we want to help
 
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
them we give them money
 
01:31:40.129 --> 01:31:40.139 align:start position:0%
understand that uh there are folks
 
01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
myself included that wonder if that's a
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
perverse incentive in that it in a sense
 
01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
to some people you know it's not the
 
01:31:52.490 --> 01:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
intent of some folks look at it but some
 
01:31:55.729 --> 01:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
people see we're giving money to schools
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
that have the worse they do with reading
 
01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
more money you give them so I understand
 
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
the intent but there's concerns about
 
01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
that what I suggested though like that's
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
not the intention no I'm not Dave I'm
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
not I'm not talking to your I'm just
 
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
set lay this out so that you'll see the
 
01:32:14.209 --> 01:32:14.219 align:start position:0%
intent of this measure so I that's
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
separate from what yeah it's got nothing
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
to do with what I was talking about
 
01:32:19.729 --> 01:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
right yeah so this is not about that
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
this is about the the impetus and the
 
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
motivation for folks like myself who
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
want to in addition to giving money to
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
schools who have deficient third grade
 
01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
reading scores to let doe come up with
 
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
some sort of a formula to be determined
 
01:32:39.649 --> 01:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
uh we don't need to get into the details
 
01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
on that uh what we'll vote on
 
01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
um soon is simply uh the notion of the
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
concept of an incentive Grant and if if
 
01:32:51.050 --> 01:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
this comes back in some form next year
 
01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
then that'll that'll uh reflect uh the
 
01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the subcommittee and
 
01:32:59.330 --> 01:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
then the whole committee so a million
 
01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
dollars and we've talked about this
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
before uh
 
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
why is representative like is touched on
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
I mean why not come up with some some
 
01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
sort of a formula to reward uh
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
achievement and I know there's that
 
01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
that's contrary to the culture of a lot
 
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
of uh Academia but um as representative
 
01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
like I said the the notion of rewarding
 
01:33:23.239 --> 01:33:24.910 align:start position:0%
like I said the the notion of rewarding
achievement

01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
fundamentally can work
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
and also if school money I mean I know
 
01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
we're always saying but we need to find
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
more money for schools here's another
 
01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
million bucks fifty thousand dollars to
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
schools they do well so or they do
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
better and if if out of that if if some
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
school improves whatever the formula is
 
01:33:48.649 --> 01:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
that we don't need you know that but if
 
01:33:50.209 --> 01:33:50.219 align:start position:0%
at some point some formula is
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
established by Doe to reward uh
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
Improvement in whatever assessment is is
 
01:33:59.689 --> 01:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
designated then some schools may say so
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
what did you do differently to improve
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
your your scores and uh we want to do
 
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
this we want to approve our scores too
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's that's the the essence
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
of it all uh yeah sure sure all right
 
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison uh just following
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
up on that uh I think it's a very
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
perverse argument to suggest that a
 
01:34:23.649 --> 01:34:23.659 align:start position:0%
school district is going to
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
enhance and improve its entire
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
educational system by giving them fifty
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that that that runs
 
01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
that's not common sense to say that uh
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
the fifty thousand dollars you know what
 
01:34:40.129 --> 01:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
might put a foreign language teacher
 
01:34:41.689 --> 01:34:41.699 align:start position:0%
back at Pittsfield High School because
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
they pay so little that it might cover
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
the cover everyone uh but it's not going
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
to have an impact necessarily on the
 
01:34:53.209 --> 01:34:53.219 align:start position:0%
scores uh I would then I raised this
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
during the testimony that this is in a
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
perverse way this is the opposite of
 
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
what and you understand this like the
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
way the NBA and the national passive and
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
the Major League Baseball goes so this
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
this particular bill would say to me if
 
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
the Golden State Warriors won as they
 
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
did they ought to get more draft choices
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
they should get more because they did
 
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
well we ought to give them more money
 
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
and the fact is that whole system is set
 
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
up so that the team that does the worst
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
can get you know they they get they get
 
01:35:29.689 --> 01:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
we get the first rap Choice uh so I this
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
is It's a perverse way to to look at
 
01:35:36.649 --> 01:35:36.659 align:start position:0%
educational change right and I do I know
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
website let's fill out your hand up I do
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
want to respond to just one of your
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
comments about uh this does not intend
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
to fix quote the entire educational
 
01:35:47.110 --> 01:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
system uh
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
there's no pretense of doing that but I
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
think I think that if it is a new
 
01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try something different
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
as was stated earlier that could make a
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
difference a a it's not going to fix an
 
01:36:02.209 --> 01:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
education the system doesn't claim to
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
but if it can identify some approaches
 
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
that work that might be emulated anyway
 
01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
uh representative Westfield sure
 
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Moffett
 
01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
um I I feel as though we're talking
 
01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:15.659 align:start position:0%
about two different completely different
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
bills here so if I could just bring us
 
01:36:21.169 --> 01:36:21.179 align:start position:0%
back to house build 1676 my question to
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
you is
 
01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
what we're working on right now with
 
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
this interim study are we able to make a
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
positive recommendation today
 
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
um in favor of this in light of the fact
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
that attorney Fenn mentioned that we
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
need to kind of offer some further
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority to the doe I just
 
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I understand that
 
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
please sure great great question and as
 
01:36:46.729 --> 01:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
I've said earlier uh having done a
 
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
number of interim studies uh gifted
 
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
being one of them or the co-curricular
 
01:36:53.209 --> 01:36:53.219 align:start position:0%
building that Diana mentioned being
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
another one of them the center of study
 
01:36:59.330 --> 01:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
process uh when the chair or whatever
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
refers to build interim study some
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
places they think bills go there to die
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
and in some cases like with gifted like
 
01:37:09.649 --> 01:37:09.659 align:start position:0%
with co-curricular like with these two
 
01:37:11.770 --> 01:37:11.780 align:start position:0%
bills I hope we're talking about here
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
out of this discussion we can identify
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
some some ways to improve the the
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
language so what I would be looking for
 
01:37:26.209 --> 01:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
today a uh would be a recommendation on
 
01:37:29.209 --> 01:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
the on the broad concept and you know
 
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
it's not the function of an interim
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
study committee to come up with a formal
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh proposal because we can't we can't do
 
01:37:39.649 --> 01:37:39.659 align:start position:0%
that you know the the session is ending
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
all we can do is make a recommendation
 
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
as to whether uh the concept uh has
 
01:37:46.729 --> 01:37:46.739 align:start position:0%
value to be developed in future
 
01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:49.139 align:start position:0%
legislation is that kind of answer your
 
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
question it absolutely does I would like
 
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
to make a recommendation that we do more
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
forward in a positive fashion with us
 
01:38:00.290 --> 01:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
okay so there's a there's a motion to
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
move forward so so in the same emotion
 
01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
your motion is to support the concept of
 
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
an incentive Grant yes representative
 
01:38:11.930 --> 01:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
Moffett that is what I'm saying
 
01:38:14.689 --> 01:38:14.699 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second for that I'll
 
01:38:16.129 --> 01:38:16.139 align:start position:0%
second that
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion to support the
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
notion as
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
stated in 1676 relative to making
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
incentive grants for school districts
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
that improving certain assessment scores
 
01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
but further uh representative luckis
 
01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
yeah my understanding of an interim
 
01:38:39.410 --> 01:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
study was to make recommendations not
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
just whether to move forward with the
 
01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
concept but recommendations with
 
01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
improvements or changes that should be
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
made to the original bill so if we're
 
01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
trying to move something forward should
 
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
we not in that include
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
that we need to get a hold of doe or
 
01:38:59.629 --> 01:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
whatever to put the additional language
 
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
in to allow for rule making and I mean I
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
thought that was the point was that we
 
01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:06.679 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:39:10.270 --> 01:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
giving some specific recommendations
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
for improvement or change
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
um that's come out of our discussions
 
01:39:19.689 --> 01:39:19.699 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
whoever then can look at this when they
 
01:39:25.729 --> 01:39:25.739 align:start position:0%
if they decide okay we'll go ahead and
 
01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
submit a bill they can look and say okay
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
well the interim study said oh we need
 
01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
to add additional language or we need to
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
make the money come out of a different
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
place or whatever so is that going to be
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
part of our
 
01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:44.699 align:start position:0%
report sure
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
um this company has already met earlier
 
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
and from that earlier you weren't able
 
01:39:53.149 --> 01:39:53.159 align:start position:0%
to be here we sent some notes out to
 
01:39:54.770 --> 01:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
everybody that was a broad summary of
 
01:39:56.209 --> 01:39:56.219 align:start position:0%
some of the discussion items that came
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
up and and that those notes are out
 
01:39:58.320 --> 01:39:59.090 align:start position:0%
up and and that those notes are out
there

01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
so the motion
 
01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.990 align:start position:0%
so the motion
um

01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:06.110 --> 01:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
that's on the table or on the floor
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
um supports the the broad concept no in
 
01:40:10.729 --> 01:40:10.739 align:start position:0%
terms of implementing the broad concept
 
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
uh I think certainly uh when this comes
 
01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
to the full committee uh and you know we
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
can speak to some specific ways pluses
 
01:40:22.510 --> 01:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
or minuses you know in terms of
 
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
implementing the incentive Grant notion
 
01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.890 align:start position:0%
implementing the incentive Grant notion
uh

01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know if it's up to the folks on the
 
01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if if our report wants to
 
01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
have some specific uh recommendation
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
that if a version of this is in a new
 
01:40:42.649 --> 01:40:42.659 align:start position:0%
LSR next year that it reflects as an
 
01:40:42.659 --> 01:40:44.030 align:start position:0%
LSR next year that it reflects as an
example

01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:40:45.649 --> 01:40:45.659 align:start position:0%
um the notes that I made
 
01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:47.159 align:start position:0%
not that it's part of the motion that's
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
on the floor but uh I would take
 
01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
attorney fence comments about rules and
 
01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
and giving them uh some better specific
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
group guidance in terms of rules for
 
01:41:01.729 --> 01:41:01.739 align:start position:0%
implementation that that would be part
 
01:41:01.739 --> 01:41:02.810 align:start position:0%
implementation that that would be part
of

01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh go go ahead you you were shaking your
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
head yeah that's that's that's not what
 
01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton was suggesting she was
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
suggesting it's it's it's it's simply a
 
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
a technical line that has to go into a
 
01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
bill if you need the department any
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
Department in the executive branch to do
 
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
rulemaking you have to enable it through
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
through 541n that's all yeah um uh uh
 
01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:29.219 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton was suggesting not any
 
01:41:31.129 --> 01:41:31.139 align:start position:0%
specific framework for rules or anything
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
like that that's up to the department
 
01:41:34.729 --> 01:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
and it's up to how the bills laid out
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
currently the bill is set up the title
 
01:41:40.129 --> 01:41:40.139 align:start position:0%
is called an incentive Grant the Bill's
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
language as as Alicia was talking about
 
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
is set up as an award so after an
 
01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
outcome is achieved then a district
 
01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
would get a fifty thousand dollar reward
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
what I've suggested is use it as a
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
commit competitive Grant process where
 
01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
districts submit a plan so now we
 
01:41:59.810 --> 01:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
actually have a black and white plan of
 
01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
of what a district is going to do and
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
and how much that's going to cost inside
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
of this fifty thousand dollar you know
 
01:42:10.729 --> 01:42:10.739 align:start position:0%
budget and um and and the the department
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
could judge those and again this would
 
01:42:16.609 --> 01:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
all go it make its way through 541a into
 
01:42:16.619 --> 01:42:17.689 align:start position:0%
all go it make its way through 541a into
rules

01:42:17.689 --> 01:42:17.699 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:42:21.169 --> 01:42:21.179 align:start position:0%
and then um and then the top whatever
 
01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
the top ten or whatever the the
 
01:42:25.609 --> 01:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
department concludes or was put into the
 
01:42:25.619 --> 01:42:26.750 align:start position:0%
department concludes or was put into the
bill

01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
um uh uh uh
 
01:42:32.209 --> 01:42:32.219 align:start position:0%
applications are selected They will
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
receive a fifty thousand dollar Grant
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
and then and now you've now you've
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
enabled you've empowered you've been and
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
you've enabled the school district to um
 
01:42:44.689 --> 01:42:44.699 align:start position:0%
um to to try to hit whatever Benchmark
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
they they put in that um in that Grant
 
01:42:49.609 --> 01:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
application I agree with everything
 
01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
Arthur has said that fifty thousand
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
dollars does not get you very far in 172
 
01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
million dollar you know Manchester you
 
01:42:59.930 --> 01:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
know School District uh budget
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
particularly when Manchester the average
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
kid in Manchester is performing at the
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
fourth percentile the governor said
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday that New Hampshire's public
 
01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
schools are great we're top five
 
01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
nationally it's just not happening
 
01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
everywhere and it's not happening
 
01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
happening everywhere because a lot of
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
the districts are so severely
 
01:43:19.729 --> 01:43:19.739 align:start position:0%
underfunded and and obviously this this
 
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
these are things that we learned
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
through the the the the school funding
 
01:43:28.209 --> 01:43:28.219 align:start position:0%
commission's uh work uh which which
 
01:43:31.609 --> 01:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think aligns with what with
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
what you're suggesting that um that we
 
01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
need to fund schools based on student
 
01:43:39.530 --> 01:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
outcomes and I think there's an
 
01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to do it not with um
 
01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
not with the billion dollars that the
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is currently
 
01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
spending on on its public school
 
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
districts but with a million dollars and
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
we might be able to learn some things
 
01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:55.739 align:start position:0%
through how the grant applications are
 
01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
um are are documented judged and then
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
put into effect sure share a couple
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
things and then Melissa back to you
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
um what you're describing said at the
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
top I was intrigued by and interested in
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
but that's a different very different
 
01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
from what this bill is about I think
 
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
Dave that would be maybe should be or
 
01:44:19.129 --> 01:44:19.139 align:start position:0%
could be a separate LSR uh that takes a
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
different approach okay as opposed to
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
trying to completely turn around the
 
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
intent of the incentive Grant thing into
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
what you describe and also I have to say
 
01:44:30.970 --> 01:44:30.980 align:start position:0%
that uh you know fifty thousand dollars
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh especially from from folks who I know
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
truly care about you know trying to
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
maximize funding for schools uh to
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
diminish a million dollars or fifty
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is not making this does
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
not intend to fix everything but it
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
intends to help in in small ways that
 
01:44:51.649 --> 01:44:51.659 align:start position:0%
maybe could turn into big ways so I I I
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
hate to hear the the idea of fifty
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
thousand or a million dollars being you
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
know basically I I think it's it's
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
important and I think it's I think it's
 
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
significant and I didn't say I didn't do
 
01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
what you just uh suggested on that I'm
 
01:45:12.530 --> 01:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm just suggesting that that fifty
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
um might be able to move the needle
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
further in a small District than than in
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
a much larger District like Manchester
 
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah so so what does that mean for
 
01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
our larger District what does it mean
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
for our smaller districts what does it
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
mean for our more our better resource
 
01:45:31.129 --> 01:45:31.139 align:start position:0%
districts that might have the money to
 
01:45:34.609 --> 01:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
invest up front to move their needle and
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
then receive the you know
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
um you know win the prize and get it get
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars back to um to to
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
cover their costs when they had the
 
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
resources to uh to implement that at the
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
beginning I'm just suggesting that some
 
01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
districts don't have the resources to to
 
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
even consider doing this and and that
 
01:46:00.169 --> 01:46:00.179 align:start position:0%
continues to increase the opportunity
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
Gap that we're seeing across our state
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
our students opportunity Gap that we're
 
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
seeing across our state between better
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
resource districts and less resource
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
districts we've got a million dollar
 
01:46:13.729 --> 01:46:13.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to try to close that
 
01:46:13.739 --> 01:46:14.990 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to try to close that
Gap

01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
Gap
 
01:46:16.729 --> 01:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
by a million dollars
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry uh Melissa you had your
 
01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
hand up and then Alicia I just I have to
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
say that I'm really concerned that I
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
continue to hear the notion that more
 
01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
money equates better outcomes because
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's not always the case and we keep
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
talking and comparing these more
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
affluent areas to Manchester just
 
01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
because you throw more money out of
 
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester school is not going to change
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
the outcome we need to take care of the
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
drug problems there we need to take care
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
of the kids there that aren't being
 
01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
taken care of just in general in their
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
home life has nothing to do with giving
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
more and more money to the education
 
01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:54.169 align:start position:0%
more and more money to the education
system

01:46:54.169 --> 01:46:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
you're right I can believe whatever I
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
want more money does not solve these
 
01:47:00.590 --> 01:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
issues the way the world is made is
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
incentive right you incentivize people
 
01:47:05.810 --> 01:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
and you reward them okay kind of like
 
01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
that old saying right you don't just
 
01:47:08.810 --> 01:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
give the man the food you can teach them
 
01:47:11.209 --> 01:47:11.219 align:start position:0%
to fish right there's there's a feeling
 
01:47:13.729 --> 01:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
of goodness when you reach your goals I
 
01:47:15.169 --> 01:47:15.179 align:start position:0%
get it you just want to throw more money
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work that way okay uh
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative luck is uh would like to
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
say something please thank you
 
01:47:25.129 --> 01:47:25.139 align:start position:0%
actually I was going on in the same
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
direction but hopefully you'll let me
 
01:47:31.370 --> 01:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
actually finish it which is that this
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
has been done over the country for
 
01:47:36.649 --> 01:47:36.659 align:start position:0%
decades putting more and more money in
 
01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
schools to get better outcomes to the
 
01:47:42.530 --> 01:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
extent that in one school the judges
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
said that all money must be given by the
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
state whatever is required and that
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
school district built everything that
 
01:47:53.689 --> 01:47:53.699 align:start position:0%
they could think of and in fact they had
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
more money they were trying to figure
 
01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
out what to do with it and yet the
 
01:48:01.609 --> 01:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
outcomes remained the same and that has
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
happened for decades all across the
 
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
country and I if you wanted statistics I
 
01:48:09.410 --> 01:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
can give them to you because they're out
 
01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:11.820 align:start position:0%
there and I have spent the summer
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
studying all of this to try to figure
 
01:48:16.729 --> 01:48:16.739 align:start position:0%
out what we can do and I keep coming up
 
01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
with this but what has worked in some
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
states in some times and in some places
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
is incentives incentives for improvement
 
01:48:28.129 --> 01:48:28.139 align:start position:0%
where people are rewarded for doing
 
01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
better that has worked throwing money in
 
01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
the beginning has not worked and you can
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
see it in state after State year after
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
year all across the country and if you
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
want the statistics I'll give them to
 
01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:40.850 align:start position:0%
want the statistics I'll give them to
you

01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:48:43.010 --> 01:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you let me give you a specific and
 
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
Innovative motion of the floor and this
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
is a discussion of the motion I guess
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
um uh here's an example
 
01:48:51.119 --> 01:48:51.709 align:start position:0%
um uh here's an example
um

01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
and there's no mandate so I I taught at
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
Trinity High School for for a while and
 
01:48:59.689 --> 01:48:59.699 align:start position:0%
they had a math team so if this
 
01:49:02.090 --> 01:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
incentive grant program of some sort
 
01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
gets into place and if some school the
 
01:49:07.850 --> 01:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
larger small Richard's poor whatever if
 
01:49:10.609 --> 01:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
if on their own uh somebody at that
 
01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
school says let's have a math club and
 
01:49:16.990 --> 01:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
we'll try to make math fun and we'll uh
 
01:49:18.770 --> 01:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
we'll have a club and we'll have
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
activities we'll do math and so if out
 
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:49:26.169 --> 01:49:26.179 align:start position:0%
um some standardized math scores improve
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
then that would and they get a reward
 
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
then suddenly uh I think the kids would
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
feel great I think the school would feel
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
great and I think that others might look
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
and say okay you get fifty thousand
 
01:49:40.250 --> 01:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
dollars would say can you use however
 
01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
they want uh so what did you do for that
 
01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars uh you had a math
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
club well you know maybe we should have
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
a math club too so if you track them you
 
01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
know I mean that's the type of
 
01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
innovative outside the box thinking that
 
01:49:57.169 --> 01:49:57.179 align:start position:0%
this might incentivize that could make a
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
difference that's just one if that helps
 
01:50:02.209 --> 01:50:02.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
01:50:05.570 --> 01:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
Mike can I speak on this I haven't
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
spoken on this one yet uh we may have to
 
01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
vote all right we'll just let you speak
 
01:50:12.129 --> 01:50:12.139 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to the discussion on the
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
so that's uh sure physical objection so
 
01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:20.209 align:start position:0%
so that's uh sure physical objection so
um

01:50:20.209 --> 01:50:20.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know when we're looking at the the
 
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
idea of incentives that it's very
 
01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:25.370 align:start position:0%
idea of incentives that it's very
important

01:50:25.370 --> 01:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
um that's why we had the commissioner
 
01:50:28.729 --> 01:50:28.739 align:start position:0%
awarding Blue Ribbon Schools here in
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
this state annually
 
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
and there's a process a very specific
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
one that Diana was alluding to and just
 
01:50:39.530 --> 01:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
recently we've asked in fact Dave was a
 
01:50:41.689 --> 01:50:41.699 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on the farm State Fair bill
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
which we allocated 250 000 in 541-a was
 
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
part of that but was very specific
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
giving the Commissioner of Agriculture
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
the criteria and conditions for awarding
 
01:50:57.530 --> 01:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
these grants for Capital Improvement on
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
the state fairs we need to if we're
 
01:51:02.209 --> 01:51:02.219 align:start position:0%
going to go here
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have to get in the 541
 
01:51:05.930 --> 01:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
business as far as being very specific
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
as to what this is used for and what is
 
01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
the criteria for awarding and what's the
 
01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
outcome we're looking for what kind of
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
data you we're using how we're analyzing
 
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
data how we're collecting data how we're
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
using that to show Improvement
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
um the um the first step that I would do
 
01:51:25.729 --> 01:51:25.739 align:start position:0%
here is try to work with doe and and
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
improve upon or support some of the uh
 
01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:30.669 align:start position:0%
improve upon or support some of the uh
recognition

01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
programs that they have in place and
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
rather than just trying to go with
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
another one I would try to add to what
 
01:51:39.129 --> 01:51:39.139 align:start position:0%
they're doing to try to improve
 
01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum secondly I would also work
 
01:51:45.070 --> 01:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
with the recently reformed
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
committee for the Improvement and
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
assessment legislative oversight
 
01:51:52.010 --> 01:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
committee which we have that meets in
 
01:51:54.770 --> 01:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
another couple weeks here and I've
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
invited Nate green to that Nate green is
 
01:51:59.209 --> 01:51:59.219 align:start position:0%
in charge the analytics over there at
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
doe looking at these assessment reports
 
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
which we have we do not have an analyst
 
01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
over there at doe right now to help us
 
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
delve down into the specific areas that
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
we are assessing we're just looking at
 
01:52:14.159 --> 01:52:15.169 align:start position:0%
we are assessing we're just looking at
that

01:52:15.169 --> 01:52:15.179 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
top 30 000 Tower as uh thirty thousand
 
01:52:22.010 --> 01:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
foot uh score which we get oh you're a
 
01:52:24.290 --> 01:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
one two three or a four and you're
 
01:52:26.209 --> 01:52:26.219 align:start position:0%
you're a wonderful school or one that's
 
01:52:29.390 --> 01:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
not proficient well why uh where are we
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
on these specific questions that are
 
01:52:33.709 --> 01:52:33.719 align:start position:0%
being asked to kids are we analyzing
 
01:52:36.590 --> 01:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
that that no we are not they're not
 
01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
doing a doe because they don't have a
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
staff to do it
 
01:52:42.649 --> 01:52:42.659 align:start position:0%
and in working with Caitlyn and working
 
01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
with Nate we've come up and there will
 
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
be an LSR it's already it's already in
 
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
the hopper
 
01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
um where we're going to be looking for
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
in the first year 160 thousand dollars
 
01:52:54.410 --> 01:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
for an analyst in the second year 145
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
000 we will be working with specific
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
schools to take these achievement test
 
01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
scores look down underneath specific
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
topics like I mentioned like mathematics
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
looking at specific areas find well we
 
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
might be doing well in this category of
 
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
math but in that one we're hurting
 
01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
that's where we're missing the boat but
 
01:53:14.689 --> 01:53:14.699 align:start position:0%
they're not doing this on the district
 
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
levels or on the state level either we
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
just don't have the staff to do it and
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
we need to get in that business so my
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be I'd add to what
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
you're going because the incentives is a
 
01:53:28.609 --> 01:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
great idea that we work with doe to
 
01:53:30.410 --> 01:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
further improve incentive programs that
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
are in place but we also support the
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation to the oversight
 
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
committee which we reconstituted this
 
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
just this last year in June on it was
 
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
put together by the governor or we all
 
01:53:46.209 --> 01:53:46.219 align:start position:0%
sponsored that you helped write it
 
01:53:49.010 --> 01:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
where they have the responsibility for
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
assessment and performance Improvement
 
01:53:54.649 --> 01:53:54.659 align:start position:0%
this be a wonderful topic to send to
 
01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
them too as well and say hey what are we
 
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
going to do to try to improve in our
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
area mathematics in the state we have a
 
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
long way to climb here so incentives are
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
great uh but I think we got to be
 
01:54:10.729 --> 01:54:10.739 align:start position:0%
specific and we've got to work with
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
other groups as well
 
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
um just another lsrs it's going to be
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
another year before we see any outcomes
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
we can get some outcomes right now if we
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
if we work a little bit more at this and
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
I think we're in the process of doing
 
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
that I would invite you to attend the
 
01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
oversight committee I think it's on the
 
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
27th Premiere I don't have that calendar
 
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
in front of me I can get it to you I'll
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
get out to everybody
 
01:54:33.470 --> 01:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
but that's going to be important because
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to have the assessment
 
01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
results from 2022. it's the 28th yeah I
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
think 27 or 21 yeah one of the two there
 
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
where what we're doing is we're looking
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
at cohorts of students what they were in
 
01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
their third grade what that same group
 
01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
was in the fourth grade by the state and
 
01:54:53.689 --> 01:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
by the schools
 
01:54:56.570 --> 01:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
and seeing where we're going because we
 
01:54:58.490 --> 01:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
know we still have that waterfall effect
 
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
in the middle schools where the scores
 
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
are dropping off why
 
01:55:06.410 --> 01:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
we we've known that for not just as a
 
01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
result of covet it's been on this day
 
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:09.719 align:start position:0%
ever since I've been on this committee
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
we've been dropping in and you talk to
 
01:55:13.850 --> 01:55:13.860 align:start position:0%
the people at Community College they say
 
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
well 60 of our kids come in that are
 
01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
remedial in mathematics of that 60
 
01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
percent 50 percent never get an
 
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
associate's degree
 
01:55:26.209 --> 01:55:26.219 align:start position:0%
and they waste a lot of money why well
 
01:55:28.129 --> 01:55:28.139 align:start position:0%
then we work with bath Dorian over there
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
with the math communities program which
 
01:55:33.229 --> 01:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
we had and we had 38 high schools
 
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
working that we showed Improvement but
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
that Grant has disappeared and a lot of
 
01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
those courses are disappearing too so uh
 
01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
we got to make some efforts to get
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
something that stays in place Dan Wolf
 
01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
was very involved with the math
 
01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
Community Learning Labs or Community uh
 
01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:50.219 align:start position:0%
program which we have it's in statute
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
there's no money to support it anymore
 
01:55:54.410 --> 01:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest that you know you you
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
add to your your recommendation that
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
incentives also be put forward to the
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and that we work
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
with doe in terms trying to strengthen
 
01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
some of their programs that they're
 
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
currently doing and recognizing
 
01:56:09.410 --> 01:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
outstanding performance and growth and
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
achievement that's why we have now
 
01:56:13.129 --> 01:56:13.139 align:start position:0%
growth not just achievement there's some
 
01:56:15.050 --> 01:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
schools that are high achieving schools
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
how are you going to ever measure growth
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
there uh and that they're doing a great
 
01:56:21.649 --> 01:56:21.659 align:start position:0%
job uh you want to recognize them for
 
01:56:24.050 --> 01:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
what they're doing as well uh not just
 
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
an incentive but an incentive just to
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
continue doing what they're doing so
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
there's so much out there and we also
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
need this analyst this analyst research
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
one to work with Nate so we can
 
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
understand what this and if anybody
 
01:56:38.930 --> 01:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
wants to see the wording which we have
 
01:56:42.169 --> 01:56:42.179 align:start position:0%
in this is going to be responsible for
 
01:56:42.179 --> 01:56:43.189 align:start position:0%
in this is going to be responsible for
um

01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:45.169 --> 01:56:45.179 align:start position:0%
um the academic research and Improvement
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
performance data analysts shall collect
 
01:56:49.609 --> 01:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
and analyze assessment attitude measure
 
01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
student progress evaluate program and
 
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
instructional Effectiveness guide
 
01:56:56.350 --> 01:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum development and resource
 
01:57:00.290 --> 01:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
allocation and promote accountability
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
um through and what they're that we're
 
01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
going to have to make some of our
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
decision making is going to be have to
 
01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
be data decision making based upon this
 
01:57:09.169 --> 01:57:09.179 align:start position:0%
information which we never really used
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
the way we should so uh I would suggest
 
01:57:15.410 --> 01:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
which we you strengthen that uh that
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee to
 
01:57:19.010 --> 01:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
incorporate some of those other avenues
 
01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
where we can work
 
01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
and not just Silo it in one little area
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
a lot a lot of stuff there and thank you
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
and we do have a motion on the floor and
 
01:57:32.810 --> 01:57:32.820 align:start position:0%
I do have to point out as I said earlier
 
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn Davis actually several of us
 
01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
spoke with several people informally a
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
doe I mentioned earlier Caitlyn had
 
01:57:41.870 --> 01:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
specific ideas as to assessments to use
 
01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
we've spoken to the commissioner this
 
01:57:47.089 --> 01:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
language was written by Caitlin and Nate
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
the language you're not this language I
 
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
just read right oh yeah but not they
 
01:57:55.729 --> 01:57:55.739 align:start position:0%
they did not write the uh 1676 no no no
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
no right right no
 
01:57:59.570 --> 01:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
um so a lot of stuff they lost everyone
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
talked to you about uh and everybody
 
01:58:05.290 --> 01:58:05.300 align:start position:0%
else later on for now it is four o'clock
 
01:58:08.450 --> 01:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
before we have a take the vote of the
 
01:58:10.970 --> 01:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
motion anything else that anybody wants
 
01:58:13.850 --> 01:58:13.860 align:start position:0%
to add Beyond what's been said
 
01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
um I'll add one thing Mike
 
01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
like sure I'll add one quick thing
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm I'm probably going to vote no
 
01:58:27.169 --> 01:58:27.179 align:start position:0%
on this if we're looking at the sort of
 
01:58:29.689 --> 01:58:29.699 align:start position:0%
the black and white of the of the the
 
01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
framework of the the interim study bill
 
01:58:36.169 --> 01:58:36.179 align:start position:0%
as as it exists right now uh I think um
 
01:58:37.609 --> 01:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
I could certainly be in a very different
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
position come the time we have a
 
01:58:41.089 --> 01:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
committee vote
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
um on this if if there's uh maybe a
 
01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:45.410 align:start position:0%
um on this if if there's uh maybe a
draft

01:58:45.410 --> 01:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
draft
 
01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
um committee report because I think
 
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
along with the recommendation for or not
 
01:58:51.890 --> 01:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
recommended for for future further
 
01:58:54.290 --> 01:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
legislation comes two or three sentences
 
01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:56.330 align:start position:0%
legislation comes two or three sentences
right

01:58:56.330 --> 01:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:58:58.370 --> 01:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
with that with the there's there's a
 
01:59:00.649 --> 01:59:00.659 align:start position:0%
blue mini blurb yeah on this but if
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
those two or three sentences I think um
 
01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
you know include some of what Rick's
 
01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
talking about and maybe something that
 
01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
that levels the playing field so that uh
 
01:59:12.169 --> 01:59:12.179 align:start position:0%
so that some of the larger districts can
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
also maybe see not as as as profound a
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh a change and um and and and and
 
01:59:22.729 --> 01:59:22.739 align:start position:0%
um have resources to be able to to do
 
01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
that uh consistent with maybe programs
 
01:59:27.649 --> 01:59:27.659 align:start position:0%
that are already in place right now
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
um you know I think I could I could take
 
01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
a more favorable position
 
01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
um on the from the committee
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that and when we after
 
01:59:39.290 --> 01:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
we met the first time on both of the
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
bills we just met on I did send notes
 
01:59:43.490 --> 01:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
out to everybody and invited uh you know
 
01:59:45.410 --> 01:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
further content or editions we'll try to
 
01:59:47.689 --> 01:59:47.699 align:start position:0%
do the same thing here so whatever the
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
vote outcome here is will uh uh do that
 
01:59:55.129 --> 01:59:55.139 align:start position:0%
and I'll send some notes out and and we
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
can um
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully get uh a minority not a
 
02:00:02.030 --> 02:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
Minority Report but some if if you think
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's some pieces of this uh for a
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
subsequent LSR next term that could uh
 
02:00:10.129 --> 02:00:10.139 align:start position:0%
could work better than what this is and
 
02:00:11.689 --> 02:00:11.699 align:start position:0%
I think that would be very useful to
 
02:00:13.609 --> 02:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
have as part of the report to the to the
 
02:00:13.619 --> 02:00:14.390 align:start position:0%
have as part of the report to the to the
full

02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
full
 
02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:17.820 align:start position:0%
for now we need we need an up or down on
 
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
um the motion to support the
 
02:00:25.970 --> 02:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:29.330 --> 02:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
motion was made by
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%

um do you have any sense of when the
whole

02:01:13.729 --> 02:01:13.739 align:start position:0%
whole
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
the whole committee will will come
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%

together I know there's uh something
um

02:01:19.850 --> 02:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:24.589 align:start position:0%
it most likely won't be till late
October

02:01:24.589 --> 02:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
October
 
02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
okay well what it is is that you know we
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
haven't met during June July August uh
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
or July and August and September we're
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
starting to pick some of this up and we
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
have other studies going on committee
 
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
the whole is going to be working on 1680
 
02:01:46.609 --> 02:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
and we have others uh so that we're
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
going to deal them all in one day you
 
02:01:50.930 --> 02:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
know rather than separately so we won't
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
be meeting until we're ready to go with
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
all this and there are some other
 
02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
sideline type committees and commissions

thanks everybody for
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:25.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:02:25.870 --> 02:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
27th of one
 
02:02:29.689 --> 02:02:29.699 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a meeting in the mornings I
 
02:02:29.699 --> 02:02:30.589 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a meeting in the mornings I
recall

02:02:30.589 --> 02:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
recall
 
02:02:34.850 --> 02:02:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:37.689 align:start position:0%
 
alrighty

02:02:37.689 --> 02:02:37.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.930 --> 02:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
but yeah tomorrow's a big day isn't it
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be interesting
 
02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:48.350 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be interesting
yeah

02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
all right I I don't know if I'm all on
 
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
board on the uh
 
02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
the money going back out to the uh
 
02:03:05.930 --> 02:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
regarding the utility or the uh the 100
 
02:03:11.209 --> 02:03:11.219 align:start position:0%
uh dollar check to individuals I I I saw
 
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
the bill come through yeah
 
02:03:16.089 --> 02:03:16.099 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know who the sponsors are
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
but that didn't show it on the bill no
 
02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
it just said it was it was rough rough
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and so so I think there's
 
02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
probably going to be some tightening up
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
and sound there's Scott I understand
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
yeah because if it was just going to go
 
02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
to the individual user myself
 
02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to go down buy a six pack
 
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
of beer and have a great no kidding yeah
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
and so yeah so that's not gonna no no
 
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
but also you know if there's if there's
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
income qualification stuff like that
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
um Henry and Dave don't need you you
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
know well I'm also concerned that here
 
02:03:52.070 --> 02:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
we had a parking garage we're dealing
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
with yeah and we allocated not the
 
02:03:59.689 --> 02:03:59.699 align:start position:0%
dollars we needed for it and and John
 
02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
Graham's fake concern was that here we
 
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
got the cash
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
and yet we're going to bond later on and
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
use our bonding power up when we have
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
cash which we could be using
 
02:04:14.330 --> 02:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
um and I'm concerned this is 60 million
 
02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of stuff here right now
 
02:04:18.770 --> 02:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm saying to myself cheapest what
 
02:04:21.050 --> 02:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
about the rainy day or what about some
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
of our Capital costs with CTE or with uh
 
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
with all these other areas School
 
02:04:28.609 --> 02:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
building Aid I'm looking at the
