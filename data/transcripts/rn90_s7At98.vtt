out of detention as well as their

families and i'm here this morning to
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
urge your support of hb 112
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
which would study the devastating impact
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
of deportations on new hampshire
 
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.190 align:start position:0%
of deportations on new hampshire
families

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would be an important
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring into the light
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
the terrible toll
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
federal policy takes on new hampshire
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
families we have
 
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.190 align:start position:0%
families we have
many

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
mixed status families in new hampshire
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
so families that include u.s citizens
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
u.s born children but also at least
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
someone who has been unable to
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
achieve a secure immigration status
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
given uh
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
what a
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic chaos is our existing
 
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.910 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic chaos is our existing
system

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
so we have seen the
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
the absolute terror that a family lives
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
with when they fear losing a loved one
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
and the grief that they live with when
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
that loved one is deported
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
we've seen the grinding stress
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
on a now single parent family or
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
older children
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
who need to
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
figure out how they're going to pay the
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
rent or get enough food to eat
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
and that economic insecurity and that
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
grief takes a terrible toll
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
on the mental and physical health
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
of those family members and those who
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
care about them including
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
children in the schools
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
we hear from guidance counselors that
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
children are
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
are suffering terribly either at the
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
prospect of losing a parent
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
or once that happens
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
we have stood with family members
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
outside of the federal building in
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
manchester as a a member of that family
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
needs to go in and check in with ice
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
and i will never forget standing with a
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
woman holding the hand of her toddler
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
and a new baby in a stroller as she
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
learned that her husband wouldn't be
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
coming back down from that appointment
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
that in fact he was going into detention
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
so watching her trauma
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
has made a lasting impression on me
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
we hear from school guidance counselors
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
and school nurses
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
about the impact on school success and
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
children's behavior
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
we hear from health workers about
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
all of the health impacts of stress
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
and even suicidal uh ideation among
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
young people and people left to to hold
 
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.829 align:start position:0%
young people and people left to to hold
the

00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
the family together or to try to so we
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
should want to know
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
the terrible cost of these
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
horrible federal policies that that have
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
an impact on our state and municipal
 
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.150 align:start position:0%
an impact on our state and municipal
coffers

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
coffers
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
concerned citizens
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
reaching out about
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
where their tax money is going to
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
and i know that my fellow
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues across the aisle can really
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%

if we are
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
hemorrhaging money on a bad process
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%

i think it would be irresponsible of us
to

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
not know
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
facts that affect our constituents and
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
how much they pay out of their paychecks
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
um i don't want to take up too much time
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
since we already back channeled
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
but that's the intent of this bill to
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
gather data to see um if
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
malpracticing as leaders and wasting our
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money thank you very much
 
00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:50.550 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money thank you very much
um

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative thank
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony i got a quick
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
question for you there and this bill has
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
come to us before
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
um the us constitution here uh says it's
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
the federal government's responsibility
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
each city in town knows how much
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars especially in
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
manchester they're paying on
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
immigration uh it's a federal
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
responsibility why would a state why
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
would we put a study committee in place
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
when there really is not a damn thing
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
they can do
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
so you're saying rather than gather this
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
data and know how much
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
we're wasting
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
because it's not our responsibility
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
we should just let the federal
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
government handle it is that what i'm is
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
no that's not what i'm saying i'm asking
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
you is the federal government
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility we already know all the
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
data we get it all you got to do is call
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
manchester how much money you're
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
spending in education uh you have i
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
already know they have 28 different
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
speaking teachers uh we've done this
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
before uh
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
rochester me that data chairman i'd
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that
 
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.230 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that
per

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
per
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
immigrant community and per immigrant
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
child in our public school system how
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
much money we as municipal taxpayers
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
have to pay to make sure that they're
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
not left behind if you have that i would
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
love to have it if that's what you're
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
saying that you you've had that
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
information given to you before
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
the reason i had it was because before
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
the bill came in the last time i called
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
a few places
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
and uh i don't want to debate over it
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just letting you know this bill came
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
before us before
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
and did you call these places to even
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
check to see if they had the numbers
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes i did we don't have that
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
in this state which is why it's it's
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
really scary that we refuse to even try
 
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
and gather that data and that's what
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is designed to do so thank you
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
for your interest in that i am also
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
greatly concerned
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any questions
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative schulte
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.230 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
representative

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
for your testimony i just had a brief
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
question do you know if our federal
 
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.510 align:start position:0%
question do you know if our federal
government

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
studied this issue
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
and they don't have you approached our
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
and you know if our federal government
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
um i think there was multiple questions
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
and i had a hard time hearing you
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
frankly i'm not sure if you're close
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
enough to a mic but thank you i'll do my
 
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.350 align:start position:0%
enough to a mic but thank you i'll do my
best

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
for what i understand again it's a
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
similar question to what my colleague
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
asked me of why
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
i try and gather this data because it's
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
not our responsibility and i sincerely
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
disagree i think as
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
local leaders it is our responsibility
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
to know how much money our local people
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
are spending on an issue and if that can
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
help the federal government
 
00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:16.470 align:start position:0%
help the federal government
um

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
make different actions and in different
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
policies and reform then that is our
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility as leaders we actually
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
do need to work together with the
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
federal government and um i don't mind
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
us taking the lead i think it's our
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
let me yeah let me speak louder because
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
that wasn't what my question was
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
my question was
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
has the federal government study this
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
and is it studying it and if not have
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
you approached anyone on our federal
 
00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
delegation to introduce such legislation
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
considering that this responsibility
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
falls within the scope of our federal
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
government they're
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
specifically in the commerce clause of
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
our constitution um any kind of
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
international commerce any kind of
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
immigration and anything regarding
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
deportation falls within federal scope
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
so have you approached our federal
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
delegation about this and does our
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
federal government already do research
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
like this that we can use as a state
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'm so grateful for that question
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
actually if you go to
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
my facebook page that's my first pinned
 
00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:38.390 align:start position:0%
my facebook page that's my first pinned
um

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
public segment i was interviewed by wmur
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
for calling on our federal delegation to
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
do more on this specific issue and that
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough data and i am
 
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
frankly concerned that um it's falling
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
on deaf ears again why i call my
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues to make this our
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility thank you for your
 
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.470 align:start position:0%
responsibility thank you for your
question

00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to try to move this
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
right along here because it's put so
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
much time i represent martha thank you
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you representative uh
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
for being here for introducing the spoke
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh i want to ask you as i look at the
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill it specifically refers to
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
primary earners
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's in the legislation so my question
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
is if a family member is not a primary
 
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.990 align:start position:0%
is if a family member is not a primary
honor

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
honor
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
the way i read this they would be
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
treated differently in
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps would be more deportable than a
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
primary earner could you address that
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
that distinction that bill seems to make
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i'm sorry for the
 
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.470 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i'm sorry for the
misunderstanding

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
this is basically an after effect what
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
happens to our communities and for the
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
legal immigrants that are here and
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
if they
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily let's say um
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
a primary earner is deported
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
and this family is now needs to apply
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
for food stamps
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
section 8 housing
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
medical needs
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
the onus is on
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
our town's people and our city people
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think that we're we're doing
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
ourselves justice by burying our heads
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
in the sand refusing to know how much
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
money our own people are paying out of
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
pocket because
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
we just sent somebody that was working
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
at a small business that couldn't afford
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
to pay maybe minimum wage and then a
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
landlord now loses
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
his tenant and doesn't have rent we have
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
to step in and take care of these
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
families and i think we need to gather
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
that data
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%

bill was introduced in 20 in 2019 i
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
think we had uh or 2020 sorry but i
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
think we had a pandemic that has
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
drastically it changed you know the
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
situation from what it was last time was
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
introduced to now have you seen impacts
 
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
on the pandemic on on these families um
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
who you're trying to
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
study yeah
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
not only were these families in rough
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
shape before and it was
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
off of non-profits and other community
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
members and just
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
some great people to continue to make
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
sure that these families were just
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
getting by
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
but now with the pandemic we're seeing
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
an increase in homelessness
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
severe health issues that are
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
on top of everything else causing damage
 
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.750 align:start position:0%

deported
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
does trauma like that impact school
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
performance or have long-term impacts on
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
development question to the previous
 
00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:10.390 align:start position:0%
development question to the previous
person

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%

i was thank you very much and i
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question the answer is we
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
see devastating impacts this is true
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
this is a traumatic experience that
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
affects a child's development for the
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives it negatively
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
impacts their school performance we hear
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
this from school nurses school guidance
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
counselors uh and from
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
community health centers
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's one of the most
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
heart-wrenching aspects of this entire
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
thing is the lifelong burden on
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
on children
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%

thanks mr chairman um and thank you uh
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh miss for mrs vogerde um my question
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
is so we have
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
in in places where there are a large
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
number of undocumented immigrants we
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
also have a house like most of those
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
places i mean and we can speak for the
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
whole state at large we have a housing
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
crisis so can you talk to me when when
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
we lose a member the primary earner how
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
does that affect you know the housing
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
crisis that we already have and can you
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
talk a little can you tell me a little
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
bit about how that's been affected
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
well sure thank you for that question
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
when when a family experiences eviction
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
which uh thankfully we've had a you know
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
a short-term moratorium on vic an
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
eviction but in regular life when people
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
lose a primary wage earner and aren't
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
able to pay their rent they uh they can
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
be evicted once an eviction is on
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
someone's record it becomes even harder
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
to ever find another willing landlord to
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
rent to that family and in a housing
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
market that
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
virtually has a zero you know
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
effectively a zero percent vacancy rate
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
then the the uh
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
the impacts on this family are long term
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty impossible to recover
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh employment and other benefits when
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't have even a secure place
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
to live all right thank you um
 
00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:10.230 align:start position:0%

work and have watched you from afar from
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
here in keene
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering about the costs
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
do we have state data on the costs for
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
children then
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
who lose their dads for example
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of the iep costs the individual
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
education plans i know it costs
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars every time
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
we have a kid who's identified through
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
the iep process
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
i've only seen as a psychologist and
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
keen have just seen you know anecdotal
 
00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.350 align:start position:0%
keen have just seen you know anecdotal
cases

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
where you know a hundred thousand
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
dollars then boom for keen
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
have you seen this and is there data
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
i imagine there is data but it hasn't
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
been aggregated into a state level
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
narrative which is the so thank you for
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
asking that this is the importance of
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight's bill um to
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
some previous questions about whether
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
the this economic impact has been
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
quantified uh there are reports and
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
somebody giving testimony after me will
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
talk about uh an article from the
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
journal on migration and american
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
security about the poverty impacts of
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
deportation on households but we have
 
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.990 align:start position:0%
deportation on households but we have
these

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.350 align:start position:0%
these
data

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
elements and the stories
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
in very local places in school districts
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
in municipal welfare offices and state
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
human service offices but it hasn't been
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
woven together into a coherent story and
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's what this bill could do
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
for the members there that are on the
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
computer there which is confusing to me
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
if i'm not looking at the screen
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh can you please put your hand up i
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
mean check on the number the end up i'll
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
check on ray's hand
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
so that way their uh representative
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
will let me know who's on there because
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
i might not see it but you end up here
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.630 align:start position:0%
at that point
representative

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
and one other last thing before i go
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
there the next bill under uh hb 117 for
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
those that are waiting on
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.430 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
yes

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you miss
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
bogarty for your testimony today so
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
based on what you just said you said
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
that there is data that affected
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
globally so could theoretically a
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
non-profit integrate this data and
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
create a database to be able to implore
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
um think tanks and our local officials
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
to take action on these specifications
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
we have some concerns especially
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
regarding um possible social welfare
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
programs for people a lot of primary
 
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.669 align:start position:0%
programs for people a lot of primary
areas

00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question i think
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
there are several non-profits
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
who would be important partners in this
 
00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:11.909 align:start position:0%
who would be important partners in this
effort

00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
effort
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
but certainly the
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
the authority or the weight of a
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
legislative study would would invite
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
agencies to take this request seriously
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
and to participate as fully as they can
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
your

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
anastasia so
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
so theoretically that a non-profit could
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
aggregate all this data together
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
and be able to compile it in a way
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's helpful to
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
yes i think that there's an important
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
role for non-profits
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
alongside the important role of
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
legislators gathering information to
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
inform smart public policy
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
we're gonna go to the next week uh
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:30.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
good morning what is yours
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
my name is bruno sorrys and i am an
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
immigration advocate at catholic
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
charities new hampshire
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
and we support this bill and urge you to
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
do the same
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
the great impact of immigrants being
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
deported from our communities
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
is far beyond one can imagine
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of economical impact there are
 
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.430 align:start position:0%
in terms of economical impact there are
approximately

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand undocumented immigrants
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
according to a study
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
conducted by the new americans economy
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
the study shows that undocumented
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
immigrants have a spending power
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
of 518
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
and contrary to what many believe
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
they have paid
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
67 million dollars in state and federal
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
taxes in that same year
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
another research published on the
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
journal on migration and human security
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
is stated that three-quarters of
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants in the united
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
states are self-employed and are
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
generally the bread winner for the
 
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.350 align:start position:0%
generally the bread winner for the
household

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
household
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
the research has shown that
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
if these undocumented immigrants
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
are deported from the mixed household uh
 
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.870 align:start position:0%
are deported from the mixed household uh
families

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
the medium household income
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
would drop from an average of 41 000
 
00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.110 align:start position:0%
would drop from an average of 41 000
dollars

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
to 19 000
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
which is about 47 percent decrease
 
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.190 align:start position:0%
which is about 47 percent decrease
furthermore

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
if these u.s us-born children
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
were left in the united states
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
the estimated cost to raise them
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.710 align:start position:0%
would be
118

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
118
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen i have shared with you
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
today the economical benefits that
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
immigrants have
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
to our economy
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
but the moral question
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
that remains unrested
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
is what if
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
it was your family
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for your information
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
actually you just opened my eyes up i
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
just haven't been researching
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
so uh mr chair if you don't mind may i
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
answer some uh questions that were asked
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
previously to my colleague
 
00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:32.149 align:start position:0%
previously to my colleague
um

00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:33.589 align:start position:0%
um
miss

00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
miss
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate that if you can send that
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
to us in an email because we have to
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
move on uh and i want to answer the
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
question maybe throw it out
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
put it out there when the question comes
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
your way yeah i just have one brief
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
question i'm according to the study that
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
you cited
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
um of the three-quarters of undocumented
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
immigrants uh who are breadwinners how
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
many do you know send money income
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
varying from outside of the u.s to their
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
families does that number report it
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
because i know there's a number of
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
immigrants who
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
work in the us radiating for years or
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
even just seasonally send a lot of their
 
00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.390 align:start position:0%
even just seasonally send a lot of their
income

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
over back to the countries of origin
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
where they're from whether they have a
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
visa whether they're undocumented or etc
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
does it say within that study how many
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
of these folks who are impossibly
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
deported how much of their income with
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
so um so it is hard to so these numbers
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
is just like the census it's uh only
 
00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:34.390 align:start position:0%
is just like the census it's uh only
um

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's only based on you know the data
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
that you know that is able to be
 
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.349 align:start position:0%
that you know that is able to be
captured

00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
captured
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh but generally speaking uh the
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
majority of uh immigrants documented or
 
00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:47.349 align:start position:0%
majority of uh immigrants documented or
undocumented

00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
undocumented
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh they also helped to support their
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
families abroad uh you know like despite
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
the fact uh you know having um you know
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
immigration status or not
 
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.150 align:start position:0%
immigration status or not
um

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
i would say you know like over 90
 
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:03.990 align:start position:0%
i would say you know like over 90
of

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
immigrants that live in the united
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
states they still send money uh you know
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
like abroad despite their uh lawful
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
i mean despite their immigration status
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh and the reason being is because to
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
most immigrants family is a core
 
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.990 align:start position:0%
most immigrants family is a core
value

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
of our culture
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
and you know like helping our families
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
that you know struggle abroad is
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
something that is essential um you know
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
to keep our families uh together even
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
though uh physically
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
because we're really dragging this on
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to reschedule this this
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
hearing if i don't have that i'm going
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.670 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
but

question
uh

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um

you're doing well uh
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
small businesses this is a state that
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
has a lot of small businesses i know
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
traditionally immigrants typically have
 
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.190 align:start position:0%
traditionally immigrants typically have
a

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
big impact on small businesses can you
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
tell me what expect like what the impact
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
has been here when you know with
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
deportations and um and small businesses
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so so uh absolutely
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
um so in uh talking about you know like
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
immigrants uh you know like in general
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
um you know like so immigrants in new
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire you know like according to
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
what they study uh by the new americans
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
economy uh they have showed that uh
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know these immigrants they have
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
generated uh
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
little over 20 000 jobs
 
00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:24.870 align:start position:0%
little over 20 000 jobs
uh

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
in in in the state in the state of new
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire alone
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
so pretty much um
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
in the economical impact uh it is
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
certainly definitely something important
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
that it is money that is uh you know
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
that keeps the cash flow in our state uh
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
you know like moving
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
um and especially
 
00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.829 align:start position:0%
um and especially
that

00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know like the research also shows
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
that three-quarters of undocumented
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
immigrants are
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know like self-employed shows
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
that you know like immigrants contribute
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
a great deal to our state economy
 
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.430 align:start position:0%
a great deal to our state economy
survival

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
survival
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
all right thank you are there any other
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%

my name is alejandro ruti i live in
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
hudson i live in new hampshire for
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
20 plus years i was a health and safety

officer with american red cross i'm a
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
retired physician
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
but the fact that i i am
 
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.390 align:start position:0%
but the fact that i i am
bilingual

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
bilingual
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
and my connection with the red cross uh
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
many families approach to me
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
for counseling and then i know uh what
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
is the impact of
 
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.270 align:start position:0%
is the impact of
when

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
the the red winner of the of the house
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
or the home uh is is deported
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
um there is already i don't want to be
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
repetitive about the things have already
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
been said
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
the psychological impact and have the
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
children and the family is enormous
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately these families live
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
afraid of
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
of the system and sometimes they are not
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
going uh to to get um to help get help
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
and counseling and so the impact that
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
these families have is enormous
 
00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.790 align:start position:0%
these families have is enormous
um

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
stress produced because maybe they need
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
to leave the home they the house they
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
live in
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
maybe they need to go to live with
 
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.030 align:start position:0%
maybe they need to go to live with
another

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
with another family and then share many
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
many people very small spaces that that
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
um living spaces that live deal lead to
 
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.109 align:start position:0%
um living spaces that live deal lead to
stress

00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
stress
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
many uh teenagers need to take the role
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
of taking care of the younger children
 
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.670 align:start position:0%
of taking care of the younger children
and

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
and that is jeopardize
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
jeopardize their the school that
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the social life of these
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
children that is needed to uh to have a
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
sense of belonging and even if they are
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
an american children
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
born here
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
they are not able to properly integrate
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
and that is leave a lot of psychological
 
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.069 align:start position:0%
and that is leave a lot of psychological
dysfunction

00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
dysfunction
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
we know i am a retired physician i came
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
here to united states working on
 
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
here to united states working on
research

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
and then i know what is the effect of
 
00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:28.550 align:start position:0%
and then i know what is the effect of
stress

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
stress
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
long-term stress on people there is
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
there is a factor of
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
even insulin dependent diabetes
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
there is two factors also there is the
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
the change on on the food uh habits
 
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.069 align:start position:0%
the change on on the food uh habits
because

00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
many people to in order to be able to
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
feed and is not suffer hunger they go to
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
junk food that is that is cheaper more
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
affordable and that is a
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
but is not nutritious
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
and and that is a that is that is not
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
good because especially when someone is
 
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.069 align:start position:0%
good because especially when someone is
developing

00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
developing
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
the chances to become obese and develop
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
diabetes is very high and develop high
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
blood pressure on early ages
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
that are risk factors for very serious
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
and devastating diseases
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
now i want to talk a little bit about
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
the var i don't trust the data that we
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
have and the reason is because many
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
people that are going through this
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
for example could be maybe both parents
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
are undocumented immigrants they don't
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
want to look for help on the official

on government
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
i didn't even realize how good i had it
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
when i struggled to send money during
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
those college years um
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
the pandemic isn't just making the
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
prospect of supporting someone through
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
the virus impossible
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
um i really don't know what i would do
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
um but the fines coming in from over
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
policing our brown bodies particularly
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
when my family members are self-employed
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
and are not categorized as essential
 
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.750 align:start position:0%
and are not categorized as essential
workers

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
in a system where we find just about any
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
way to survive such as my father and
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
stepfather making money by working as
 
00:46:32.319 --> 00:46:34.150 align:start position:0%
stepfather making money by working as

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
mechanics
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
skills they learned when they were
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
ranchers when they were out back in
 
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.390 align:start position:0%
ranchers when they were out back in
mexico

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
mexico
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
and my mom taking care of kids or
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
selling clothes at markets or driving
 
00:46:44.319 --> 00:46:45.510 align:start position:0%
selling clothes at markets or driving
individuals

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.190 align:start position:0%
individuals
um

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
for a small pay um
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
isn't really a part of this essential
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
workers um kind of
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
like liberty of
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
connecting with people
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
at the moment like in supermarkets so
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's not under the same
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
um situation so it makes me really
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
nervous day to day i'm thinking that
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
they're going out and doing these things
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
to survive but also putting themselves
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
in danger um
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
and also putting themselves in danger
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
not only
 
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.430 align:start position:0%
not only
um

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
on the prospect of the um
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
getting getting and contracting the
 
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.230 align:start position:0%
getting getting and contracting the
virus

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
virus
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
with very little support um possible but
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
also um
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
the possibility of like being pulled
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
over my mom's driving and
 
00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know what that means
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
really um
 
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.430 align:start position:0%
really um
and

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's my kind of um perspective on
 
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.470 align:start position:0%
that's my kind of um perspective on
things

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
um i would love to see this bill um come
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
and start studying what the effects of
 
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
and start studying what the effects of
um

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:55.270 align:start position:0%

brings to the families and i'm gonna
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
tell you a little story about a family
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
that came really close to my heart two
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
years ago when their father was deported
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
he's been here he was here for over 30
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
years with not any type of criminal
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
problem or anything so the two younger
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
children were 9 and 11 at the time
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
and his wife uh he they have a 19 year
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
old daughter also
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
the two younger kids are totally
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
devastated right now
 
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.910 align:start position:0%
devastated right now
they

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
are in in psychological care the little
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%

school he doesn't want to connect now uh
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the internet the mom has to go to
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
work so she has to leave the the kids
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
with the oldest daughter when she can
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
the other daughter was forced to
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
to put a cut down her classes or college
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
classes and work because now she feels
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
that obligated to help support the
 
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.950 align:start position:0%
that obligated to help support the
household

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
household
 
00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.150 align:start position:0%
household
and

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
the mom has lupus and the stress has
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
brought the lupus on
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
before the father was the main
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
breadwinner of the house and he was able
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
to provide for the family
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
in every single aspect now they are
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
being they have been able i mean they
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
have been obligated to use the food and
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
rental assistance uh and you know this
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
is just
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
one single
 
00:52:21.119 --> 00:52:22.470 align:start position:0%
one single
case

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.670 align:start position:0%
case
uh

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
and it's not
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
the people that are deported that are
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
suffering you know we we lose the when
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
we lose the main breadwinner we lose the
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
the spending power of the whole family
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
we lost the taxes that these people
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
bring to our state we we we spent a lot
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
of money educating them and giving them
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
counseling and giving them stuff that
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
before they did not need because they
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
were able to afford it on their own
 
00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:51.270 align:start position:0%
were able to afford it on their own
so

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
when they live in overcrowded like
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
alejandro said my son when i adopted a
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
mexican boy a few years ago like 10
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
years ago there were 17 people living in
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
a two-bedroom apartment because they as
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
as the brothers were deported the wives
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
would move in with their children into
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
one apartment because they could no
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
longer afford to rent on their own so it
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
is in our best interest as a community
 
00:53:17.119 --> 00:53:18.230 align:start position:0%
is in our best interest as a community
to

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
see what how much money we we spend on
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
them so i support this bill 100
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.309 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
forever

00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
brady there's no questions i want to
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much brad are you on uh
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
oh yes i am hey brad on my mic here when
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
the red uh when the red is does that
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
mean it's on or off
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
on if um
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
that means it's off if you're asking
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
about your tile that's popping up on the
 
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.190 align:start position:0%
about your tile that's popping up on the
screen

00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so i have to make sure when i
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
press the button that the red light goes
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
out then
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
so because you're in the room the mic
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
should pick you up and um you don't have
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
to undo or else there'll be um some like
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
i think i think you should um i think
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
the red means it's muted so if there's a
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
button okay i think we should test it
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
can you test because i have some people
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
are going on and on when we're trying to
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
slow it down to get it under three
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
minutes here and i'm just wondering if
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
yes i can i think claire
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%

and thank you to the committee my name
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
is samuel hernandez and
 
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
i'm here with coalfire an organization
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
led um
 
00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:29.670 align:start position:0%
led um
student-led

00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
student-led
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
at dartmouth college and
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to i'm here to support this
 
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:35.750 align:start position:0%
i'd like to i'm here to support this
bill

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.589 align:start position:0%
bill
so

00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
i would like to bring up that on though
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh for mixed families although this um
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
undocumented status may only be a
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
symptom of
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh primary breadwinners um
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
that kind of identification is really
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
diffused through the family um that are
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
from um
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
kids and primarily like their children
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
can also be associated with that symptom
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
so they might be although u.s citizens
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
but they're less likely to um associate
 
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.069 align:start position:0%
but they're less likely to um associate
uh

00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
with with help from from school until it
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
becomes unmanageable
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
so i believe that um studying the
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
effects and especially now uh with more
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
um tumultuous times
 
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.710 align:start position:0%
um tumultuous times
that

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
this uh the economic um impacts that are
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
gonna be felt in the community for a
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
very long time that are gonna be um
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
maybe underfunded and it won't be clear
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
how long um this
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
this recovery
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
might um actually take um because
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh schools will have to spend more uh
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
individualized time with more struggling
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
students and um
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
these students are more prone to be from
 
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
families that are undocumented and have
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to support that bill i'm
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
trying to keep it under three minutes
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
but i think that it's extremely
 
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.910 align:start position:0%
but i think that it's extremely
important

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that it's in the best
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
interest of the state
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
try and learn um what the economic
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
impacts of that um those consequences
 
00:57:22.799 --> 00:57:23.750 align:start position:0%
impacts of that um those consequences
are

00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you samuel appreciate your
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative dilemmas
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr hernandez
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
probably a pretty touching question but
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
and probably you're going to think i'm
 
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.829 align:start position:0%
and probably you're going to think i'm
not

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
what is there now when the primary
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
correct winner you're talking about
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
people who are illegal immigrants right
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
these people are are undocumented
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
because they're here illegally so when
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.069 align:start position:0%
they are
brought

00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
brought
 
00:58:00.079 --> 00:58:00.870 align:start position:0%
brought
out

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.150 align:start position:0%
out
and

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
they have to go back
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere else deported
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
can their families go with them i mean
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
can their families just you know when
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
they let's say they go back to bogota
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
can their families just go to bogota and
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
be with them there where they can earn
 
00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:21.349 align:start position:0%
be with them there where they can earn
money

00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
um i'm just gonna repeat the question
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
because i was kind of uh i'm gonna
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
repeat it back to you so uh i i'm
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly you're you're
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
asking if um if families can basically
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
get deported as well
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
with their primary
 
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.190 align:start position:0%
with their primary
breadwinners

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
breadwinners
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
because as an extension you're just
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
saying like
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
they also
 
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
could leave or
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise be deported as well like
 
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
self-deporting um to answer that
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
question i think that it's very
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to imagine um
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
for any
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
any students
 
00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.230 align:start position:0%
any students
to

00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
the question came out wrong um yeah
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
we've got to make it quick if we can
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry i'm mr
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
i said you know can't they just go i
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
mean so they don't have to be deported
 
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying
 
00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:15.750 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying
that

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
that they actually should probably
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh can they go you know
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
get a ticket play ticket and go with
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
their family and with their husbands or
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
primary friend winners and go to
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
wherever the person that's being
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
deported goes they are not being
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
reported they can
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
i think that anyone can buy a ticket and
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
leave anywhere um i don't think that's a
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
problem but i think that if you're
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
talking about um uh taking opportunities
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
away from u.s citizens that um that
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
these children are u.s citizens then i
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
think that that's
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
um kind of alarming that
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
the state might want to even uh consider
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
that because i think that as
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
as uh citizens i think that they also
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to these um to
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
these kids
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
so um i don't think that that's a
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr hernandez for your powerful
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
testimony my my question is are families
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
forced to rely on social welfare
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
programs after immigrant breadwinners
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
it is uh under my impression that they
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
are so um
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
some of our work here are basically um
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
is based around kind of organ organizing
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
and and promoting and speaking at
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
different like immigration advocacy and
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
reform um during like in college here
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
and also surrounding areas of new
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire and vermont
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
and we've had
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
like many opportunities to
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
meet these individuals more personally
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic and and actually get
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
to hear the story and
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
even before the pandemic um
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
these individuals were having a very
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
difficult time um so
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
i i can't believe how um
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
how this is gonna be um even a
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
a situation that might be able to be
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
dealt individually within this family um
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
just within this like tumultuous time
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the support um
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
that um other other families might have
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative are
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%

so that way there we
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%

sheriff
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
i headed up question for bruno and i i
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
had my hand up since bruno
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
spoke um and i want to ask bruno what
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
the impact is because um
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
he's he was saying that a lot of these
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
immigrants they provide employment
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
to a lot of citizens or our state
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
there some of these immigrants they have
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
a small businesses where
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh they uh provide
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
employment so i just wonder
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
what their
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
the impact is when these immigrants they
 
01:02:47.359 --> 01:02:48.230 align:start position:0%
the impact is when these immigrants they
get

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.349 align:start position:0%
get
deported

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
deported
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
and um u.s citizens lose their jobs
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
okay i i want to thank you for i want to
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
ask you a question to bruno but if
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's for the uh state representatives
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
here the ones to be asked the question
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh you would be on here to
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh give your testimony on where you
 
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
support the bill or not support the bill
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm supporting the bill sir and
 
01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm speaking and
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
i'm supporting the bill because we need
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
to study this
 
01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:17.990 align:start position:0%
to study this
we

01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
as an immigrant not us proud to be a
 
01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.910 align:start position:0%
as an immigrant not us proud to be a
citizen

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
i believe that we need to we need to do
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
a study we need to like really study how
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
much money the state is losing when
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
these people get deported
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
they provide
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
jobs to a lot of citizens of this
 
01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:36.309 align:start position:0%
jobs to a lot of citizens of this
country

01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
and not only that
 
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.710 align:start position:0%
and not only that
but

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
what is the impact when these farm these
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
family members get deported how much
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
money they're causing to the state
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
when we have to provide education
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
medical care
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
and then all the other needs for the
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
family members who the u.s citizens
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i was like really disappointed when
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
i heard
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
why we don't send their family members
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
with the person who got supported
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
because they're u.s citizens
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
and they have the right to education and
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
they have they have the right to stay
 
01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:10.950 align:start position:0%
they have they have the right to stay
here

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.750 align:start position:0%
here
and

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
and have better life
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
and um yeah
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
yeah i didn't realize that you are a
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
state rep i recommend when you use zoom
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
and you add in rep next to your name so
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
we would key in on that there um
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%

we didn't have there's no question oh
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%

maria for uh coming to testify my
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
question is is it true that some of the
 
01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.309 align:start position:0%
question is is it true that some of the
kids

01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
of these primary bread earners who are
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
being deported is it true that some of
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
these kids might only be american
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
citizens and not citizens of the
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
countries that they would be deported to
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
it is true
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
some of these kids
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
that were born here
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
and at the
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
u.s citizen only and that the only thing
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
they know is
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
english and they the only thing they
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
know is
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
their own country the us
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
and then for them to be deported to
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
another country
 
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
that be not going to be really harmful
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
because um it's like
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
taking away the rights
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%

asma el hee and i'm the movement
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
politics director for rights and
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
democracy in new hampshire and i'm
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
speaking in favor of hb112
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
um i am an immigrant and i am also a
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
citizen but i was not always a citizen
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
of this country um i hope we do care
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
enough to know how deportation affects
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
constituents um yours and our community
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
members so the role of public policy is
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
vital in gathering data it shows we care
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
about this issue even if we do not care
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
about it it should at least we should at
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
least know how it's affecting our state
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's just the responsible thing to do so
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things i need you to know is
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
that most of the undocumented community
 
01:06:38.319 --> 01:06:39.510 align:start position:0%
that most of the undocumented community
members

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
enter the united states legally
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes visas get expired and
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
people might not get paperwork or know
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
how to fill out paperwork right i
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
remember as a child our landlord would
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
call my home and tell me to tell my
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
mother that they were going to report us
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
for complaining about for example trying
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
to fix our house right
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
um and as a child i was very confused
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
but i knew that if police were called on
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
our family it would not wind up well
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
because we knew we should never never
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
call the police and that just means that
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
we were afraid police would call
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
immigration customs enforcement now i
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
know this committee is about what
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
happens to citizens of families when
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
their breadwinner gets deported but i
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
want to expand this to include all
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
families not just citizens because
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
people all people should matter here
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
children never ask for the conditions
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
they find themselves in so we have to
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
have sympathy towards all children not
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
just those that are citizens i
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
personally know of a family where a
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
child lives in a mixed
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
family their father was deported two
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
years ago their father was arrested at a
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
gas station when the employees call the
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
police on him and people of color are
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
oftentimes racially profiled right and
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
so police came and they handed him to
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
ice immigration customs enforcement he
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
was from brazil but he was born in
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
australia they deported him to australia
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
a country he knows nothing about he just
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
was simply born there right and he had
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
to figure out a way to get to brazil
 
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
because he can no longer come to the
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
united states this father has left two
 
01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.470 align:start position:0%
united states this father has left two
children

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.750 align:start position:0%
children
um

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
which they have not seen their father
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
for two years the mother
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
who was employed when her husband lived
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the united states they did they both
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
were working but now that her husband's
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
no longer there she's taken a huge
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
financial blow right um and i did not
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
even ask the mother you know what is
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
this doing to her children because i
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
didn't need to we can all imagine what
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
it could feel like to have a loved one
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
torn from our lives right new hampshire
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
can't turn a blind eye on the fact that
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
immigrants not only contribute to our
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
communities as other speakers have
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
already mentioned but they're integral
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
to our communities and our state and
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
when we deport families that's one more
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
person that does not contribute to our
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
communities that's one less spender
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's one less worker that's one less
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
friend that's one less community member
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
and one society less that is what it has
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
the potential to be right so this study
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
committee is vital it's important for an
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
erased community whose impact is great
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%

who had fled a drug gang uh in honduras
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%

01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
and when he refused
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
he was shot
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
when i visited him in detention he
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%

the

01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
where the bullet hole had pierced him in
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
the side
 
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
he came to our country to ask for asylum
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
and was summarily didn't uh thrown in
 
01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.709 align:start position:0%
and was summarily didn't uh thrown in
detention

01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
detention
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
because our system is so overloaded he
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
was denied asylum while he was deported
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
his father was killed assassinated by
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
the same drug gang and for the reasons
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
that they were still trying to get at
 
01:12:26.239 --> 01:12:27.510 align:start position:0%
that they were still trying to get at
him

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:29.250 align:start position:0%
he decided that
 
01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:30.630 align:start position:0%
he decided that
[Music]

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
he needed to come back to this country
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
looking for safety the second time he
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
came he did not ask he did not turn
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
himself in because he knew he would be
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
just sent back to the danger he he
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
escaped from
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
so he crossed the border without
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
permission and began to make a life for
 
01:12:48.159 --> 01:12:49.350 align:start position:0%
permission and began to make a life for
himself

01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
himself
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
he met a young woman
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
who already had a special needs child
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
and he fell in love with both of them
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
they got married
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
they didn't have enough money to
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
hire legal representation so even though
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
he was married to a u.s citizen he
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
that's why i met and met him in
 
01:13:08.239 --> 01:13:09.669 align:start position:0%
that's why i met and met him in
detention

i would like to point out as the
 
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
chairman just said that this bill is
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as passed by the house
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
a year ago
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
it passed the house was heard in the
 
01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.790 align:start position:0%
it passed the house was heard in the
senate

01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
was part of an omnibus bill that the
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
governor vetoed and the veto was
 
01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.270 align:start position:0%
governor vetoed and the veto was
sustained

01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
sustained
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
so we have resubmitted this bill which
 
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
use of force on our national guard
 
01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.790 align:start position:0%
use of force on our national guard
facilities

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
members of the adjutant general staff
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
will be testifying after me to talk
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
about the rationalization
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
of of our rsa to bring it into line
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
with both the air force and army
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
regulations which are not the same
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
within the dod
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
it is important that we do this so that
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
our forces meet in the national guard
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%

the air force association as i'm a

20-year a 25-year air force veteran um
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
we did support this bill last time we do
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
support this bill this time primarily
 
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
because what it does is standardize the
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
way we do things in new hampshire with
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
the way that the the active duty force
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
does things and the more that you can do
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
that particularly in an era where the
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
the guard and the reserve forces of our
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
military are interchangeable with active
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
duty forces in so many different areas
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
the better that it is and that's all i
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%

original intent of the law um
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
which um due to no fault of the drafters
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh due to the fact that there is no
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
longer an army regulation on the rules
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%

into the original drafters and bring the
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%

house bill 580
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
in order to

in order to
reinforce

01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
reinforce
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
the federal law on deployment of our
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
national guard
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
this is not a
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
question of foreign policy
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
it is not a commentary on
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
foreign policy
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
it is simply a reminder of what the law
 
01:24:52.719 --> 01:24:54.070 align:start position:0%
it is simply a reminder of what the law
is

01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
the law does require that
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
national guard to be deployed
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
or called to federal service
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
without the authority of the governor
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
to repel an invasion
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
of the united states or its territories
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
or to uh uh in a declaration of war or
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
in a time of war
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
or that it be done um
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
to enforce the laws of the united states
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
and of course
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
due to the
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
posse comitatus act
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
enforcing the laws of the united states
 
01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.430 align:start position:0%
enforcing the laws of the united states
domestically

01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
domestically
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
would require
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
invoking the uh insurrection act so
 
01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
our national guard
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
i want to thank mr warren perry for the
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
data that he provided me our national
 
01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.149 align:start position:0%
data that he provided me our national
guard

01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
guard
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire has been been
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
deployed overseas
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
some element or another deployed
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere overseas
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
in hostile zones
 
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
continuously since 2001
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
so there's never been a time that we
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
have not had national guard deployed
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
overseas in combat zones
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's continuing on into 2021 now with
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of misunderstanding about
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
federal supremacy
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to try to clear that up
 
01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.750 align:start position:0%
i'd like to try to clear that up
somewhat

01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
until 1987
 
01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
governors could simply refuse
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh to allow their guard to be
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
placed into federal service
 
01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.110 align:start position:0%
placed into federal service
then

01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh what's called the marshall amendment
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
to title 10
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh that was modified so that governors
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
can no longer withhold their consent
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
based on their objection to the
 
01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.310 align:start position:0%
based on their objection to the
place

01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.110 align:start position:0%
place
uh

01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
or mission of training
 
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
and that is for training the supreme
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
court upheld that that governors cannot
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
withhold consent to activate national
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
guard for training even if it means
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
being deployed overseas for training
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
that is only for training
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
this is a much simpler issue than most
 
01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.270 align:start position:0%
this is a much simpler issue than most
people

01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
try to make it
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
the law simply says that
 
01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.189 align:start position:0%
the law simply says that
uh

01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
in order to be activated well together
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
without the governor's consent
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
that there must be
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
a declaration of war
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
an invasion to repel
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
or to enforce the laws of the united
 
01:27:50.159 --> 01:27:51.270 align:start position:0%
or to enforce the laws of the united
states

01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
so this does not conflict at all uh
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
with federal law a matter of fact it
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
repeats it
 
01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.550 align:start position:0%
repeats it
and

01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
states that
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
simply that the governor
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
will withhold consent absent any of
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
those uh
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
justifications uh that should be an
 
01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.030 align:start position:0%
justifications uh that should be an
automatic

01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
automatic
 
01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.189 align:start position:0%
automatic
because

01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
the the governor simply uh shouldn't be
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
allowing our guard to be deployed
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
without those uh things which are
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
what is uh called for in the law in the
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
first place
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
won't take up any more of your time with
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
explanation but i will entertain
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh for your
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
introduction here uh representative do
 
01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
we have any questions for uh
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative craig
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative welcome
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um so i just have a
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
question a hypothetical question so for
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
example the vietnam war was as i
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
understand was not a declared
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh war by congress
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
so if um we were in a conflict say again
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
in asia
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
and uh it was not a declared war
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
and so by doing this would the governor
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
then be able to say sorry new hampshire
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
or something like the
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
invasion of afghanistan following on
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
9 11
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
would the
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
with the state with the governor then
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
say yeah but we're but we're not going
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to we're not going to
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
participate because we don't agree with
 
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.310 align:start position:0%
participate because we don't agree with
that

01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
that would be a uh
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
issue of policy
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
my bill does not address
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
the governor objecting to one particular
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
action or the other
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
it is not based on objection to the
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
place or the nature
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the deployment
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
it is simply
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.310 align:start position:0%
that the
law

01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
would have to be in votes uh so that
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
there would be a declaration of war
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
now whether or not an authorization for
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
the use of military force or the war
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
powers act would qualify that is a legal
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
question for the courts to decide uh the
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
courts so far have not uh
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
congress has largely
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh abdicated its power to declare war by
 
01:30:22.639 --> 01:30:23.669 align:start position:0%
uh abdicated its power to declare war by
simply

01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
giving the chief executive uh carte
 
01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.590 align:start position:0%
giving the chief executive uh carte
blanche

01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
blanche
 
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.189 align:start position:0%
blanche
but

01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
again that's a that's a
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
a policy question
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
that would not matter in this case um
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
under what you propose say another
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
vietnam or for
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
the invasion of afghanistan or iraq
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh no there has not been a declaration
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
of war there's not an
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
imminent invasion of the united states
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
and we're not enforcing uh u.s law
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
if we can keep the you know pretty short
 
01:30:56.719 --> 01:30:58.790 align:start position:0%
if we can keep the you know pretty short
questions

01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
for you there um and if i can just get
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
you a real quick answer on this here so
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
we can move on is under the uh court
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
case that went on
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh the perfect
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
versus department of defense uh where
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
the case was argued in front of the
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
united states supreme court where the
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
governor of the state could either
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
withheld consent
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
of regard to hacking outside the united
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
states because of any objection location
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh supreme court upheld this law by a
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
vote of nine to nothing supporting uh
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
what say you on that real quick
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely the purpose case
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
that i mentioned during my introduction
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
governor park pitch of minnesota
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
objected and withheld his consent
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
after passing the marshal after passage
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
of the martial amendment
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
and he did that based on
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
both the location which was honduras and
 
01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
the nature of the training and that's
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
not allowed under the
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
marshall act for training and the
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
supreme court case
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
repeatedly said training it only
 
01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.510 align:start position:0%
repeatedly said training it only
addressed

01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
training that a governor may not
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
withhold consent uh when guard is
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
brought into active service for training
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
because all national guard
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
training is done under
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh u.s army
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
and not under the national guard so
 
01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:29.990 align:start position:0%
and not under the national guard so
naturally

01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
naturally
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
it does allow uh active duty for
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
training and that training can be
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
which we all know most of it will pay
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
out freshman freshman on here under
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
title 30
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
training but the thing is the governor
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
um really had those except for 50 of the
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
national guard is and i'm gonna have
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
warren perry on soon to verify
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh i mean my memory has gone in a lot of
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
this here but
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
um did anyone talk to you about that on
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
past historical data here in the state
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
or throughout the country with title 10
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you were breaking up during a
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
lot of that yes this only applies to
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
title 10. it it quotes title 10 exactly
 
01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:23.830 align:start position:0%
title 10. it it quotes title 10 exactly
the

01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
the basis of the law is title 10. uh
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
does not affect any activation for title
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
32 at all
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i'd like uh you have a
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
question yeah
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh representatives thank you thank you
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh chairman of sorrow and thank you for
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
testifying and particularly question
 
01:33:40.639 --> 01:33:42.149 align:start position:0%
testifying and particularly question
representative

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
so my question is in regards to the uh
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
pepperidge first department of defense
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
by justice stevens
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
specifically in that case there's a
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
clause that stevenson
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
mentions of the uh
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
of the 1986 montgomery amendment which
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
explains that withholding a governor was
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
holding their consent for national
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
guardian activity outside the country
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
the site purpose or schedule was fought
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
with being upheld in that case so
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
in the case throughout it the justice
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
uses the training of an example of that
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
specific circumstance
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
but he explained that they're upholding
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
the entire amendment he determined
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
montgomery and then
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
four years prior to decision 1980
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
so my question is twofold
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
do you think that this was wrongly
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
decided and that the scope's too broad
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
with the supreme court decision and do
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
you have any um
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
any scholarly evidence or any
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional scholars that agreed that
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
the decision itself limits it itself to
 
01:34:56.719 --> 01:34:58.070 align:start position:0%
the decision itself limits it itself to
training

01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
it was only
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
about training uh
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
the case was about training uh there was
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
not a
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
title 10 activation
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
at question and the supreme court did
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
not go beyond the balance of the case
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
itself so the case was only about a
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman and uh thank
 
01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:28.470 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman and uh thank
you

01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative craig for taking my
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
questions good to see you outside of our
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
fish and game meeting um
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
i just found out that i was subbing
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday at 4 so i
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
have to admit that i didn't have a lot
 
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
of time to do any research on these
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
questions so i might be asking a very
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
silly question and if i do um please
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
excuse that
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
is the national guard ever deployed
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
overseas for
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
natural disasters of floods hur
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
earthquakes whatever and
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
is would this bill um impact such a
 
01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:05.430 align:start position:0%
is would this bill um impact such a
decision

01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any uh it's certainly
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
possible particularly when it comes to
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
our air national guard
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
refueling mission
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
supplies or relief efforts somewhere
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
but uh i don't believe that that would
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
be affected by it um
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
certainly not the intent uh but uh
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh if that would uh
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
that would be uh certainly a brief
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
activation uh that could fall under
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
training uh would not necessarily be
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
a title 10 activation
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative correct that might be a
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
question for the next speaker there uh
 
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
with the adjective
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representative
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
hobby question no okay
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
yes actually i i do and it's not really
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
a follow-up it's just a reit
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
reiterating his answer because um this
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
is new to me
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
even if this bill would pass we would
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
still have the opportunity if
 
01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
in some brief instances the national
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
guard needed to be deployed overseas for
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
national uh natural disasters that still
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
would be able to uh take place is that
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
what is that what your answer was
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
if i may that's really a question that's
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
in general him just like me a retired
 
01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:40.390 align:start position:0%
in general him just like me a retired
marine

01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
and i would save that for the adjutant
 
01:37:42.159 --> 01:37:43.189 align:start position:0%
and i would save that for the adjutant
general

01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:37:43.199 --> 01:37:44.070 align:start position:0%
general
okay

01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i i apologize like you said i
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know this is new to me and i didn't
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
know until yesterday late that i would
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
be um on the board so i i do apologize
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
for questions that maybe aren't either
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
too simple or not appropriate thank you
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's my question to the next speaker
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
kevin i want to i mean representative
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
craig i want to thank you very much for
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
coming on i see no more other uh
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
questions without without further delay
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
welcome aboard wine
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
good morning again sir uh again it's a
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here before the committee
 
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh can everybody hear me
 
01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.430 align:start position:0%
uh can everybody hear me
yes

01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
so the department takes no position on
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
this bill i submitted some written
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
testimony late yesterday evening i know
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
some of the members of the committee has
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
seen it
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
our interest here is to ensure that the
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee is aware of any impacts
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
that this bill's passage may have on
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
the operation of the new hampshire
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
national guard both on the army and the
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
so our biggest concern is it puts at
 
01:38:57.199 --> 01:38:58.870 align:start position:0%
so our biggest concern is it puts at
risk

01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
risk
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
federal funding
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
up to the amount of 100 million dollars
 
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
a year if passed so if the if the
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
governor withdraws consent for any
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
reason for the federalization of the new
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire national guard the president
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
and the federal government have the
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
authority to withhold funding for the
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
national guard
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh that's problematic because it
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
includes wages for all of the 2 800
 
01:39:23.189 --> 01:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
members of the national guard all the
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
operational costs to uh to uh to keep it
 
01:39:27.199 --> 01:39:28.070 align:start position:0%
operational costs to uh to uh to keep it
moving

01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
moving
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
and the positioning of our major weapon
 
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.030 align:start position:0%
and the positioning of our major weapon
systems

01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
all of which are owned by the federal
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
government and
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
loaned essentially to the new hampshire
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
national guard those include the
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
blackhawk helicopter which is uh
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
instrumental in our search and rescue
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
efforts in the white mountains the kc-46
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh refueller and the high mars rocket
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
system which is really a
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
a weapon system designed for engaging
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
with and destroying
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
enemies of the united states
 
01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:55.910 align:start position:0%
enemies of the united states
uh

01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
it would also uh impact
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
the strength of our units right without
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
funding we can't we can't have units in
 
01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire national guard
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
600 of which are responding right now to
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:09.590 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
in

01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:10.550 align:start position:0%
in
uh

01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
essentially under the control of the
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
government but in a title 32 federal
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
status right so even though they're
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
title 32 folks
 
01:40:18.719 --> 01:40:19.669 align:start position:0%
title 32 folks
uh

01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
and they're uh
 
01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:22.870 align:start position:0%
and they're uh
being

01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
paid by the federal government they're
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
under the control of the governor
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
and again about 600 of them are doing
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
that across the state
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
right now so
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
i would encourage you just to review the
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
written testimony that i provided last
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
night i know it was late i apologize for
 
01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:40.550 align:start position:0%
night i know it was late i apologize for
that

01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
working with the lawyers to get this
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
done i would say that it was a pleasure
 
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
to uh to communicate with representative
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
craig with regard to the history of
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
deployments for the new hampshire
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
national guard
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
but i didn't know what his intent was
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
when he was collecting this data so we
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
provided you know in a very transparent
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
of deployments we've had and uh the
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
extreme high operational tempo that the
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire national guard has had
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
and we're happy to continue to engage
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
with him to talk to him about the
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
impacts of this bill
 
01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:14.950 align:start position:0%
impacts of this bill
uh

01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
if he so chooses
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
pending any questions that you might
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
have uh i'll conclude my testimony uh
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um lauren warren can you speak
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
to uh representative harvey's questions
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
that she asked the last speaker
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
so it just depends on how we're
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
mobilized right so there are two there
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
are two statuses that that uh that
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
generally well there are tons of
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
statuses right that members of the new
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire national guard could be in the
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
two big mobilization or act uh full-time
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
active duty kind of statuses there are
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
under the provisions of title 10 which
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
they are completely federal
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
and under provisions of title 32 which
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
there's some question whether or not
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
they're state or federal and it really
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
gets to
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
who's controlling the guard not
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily who's paying right so for
 
01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:01.750 align:start position:0%
necessarily who's paying right so for
example

01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
now when the hurricanes hit puerto rico
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
we were able to use our
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
our airplanes from peas and our soldiers
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
and go down and support the relief
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
efforts in puerto rico
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
generally in a title 32 status right but
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
paid by the federal government so this
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
the state didn't have to to pony up
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
money to pay for that
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
there are some instances where we have
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
state uh the national guard and state
 
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
status and their
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me they're generally responding
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
to state issues right so we've had some
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
folks at the department of corrections
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
working we've had folks working with uh
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
department of employment security those
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
folks are generally paid for out of
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
01:42:40.709 --> 01:42:40.719 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
if there was a disaster and it was
 
01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:44.719 align:start position:0%
required that the national guard support
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
that reset uh disaster somewhere in the
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
world it would probably be
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
in a title 32 status but it could be in
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
a title 10 status
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
and it would
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
generally uh it could be prohibited by
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
this by this bill could you know but i'm
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
not i'm not a lawyer
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
so i really have to go back and and talk
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
with the staff judge advocate to get a
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
real answer about that
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
but you know i i would think that the
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
governor would always consent if it was
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
about human suffering i mean
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
politics would be a side on that
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh i would say uh that
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that answers your question
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative harvey i can see you on
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
the screen shaking your head i hope that
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
answered your questions a long
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
long-winded answer i apologize
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative harvey i know you didn't
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
ask the question but i'll give you an
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity if in fact uh did he answer
 
01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh yes he did thank you so much mr
 
01:43:39.119 --> 01:43:39.990 align:start position:0%
uh yes he did thank you so much mr
chairman

01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you um
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative moffat has a question uh
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh thank you question and
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully a follow-up uh does the new
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire national guard have
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh personnel in an ir individual ready
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
reserve status whether they're
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
retirees or not
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
so the short answer is they're they move
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
to the i what's called the ing or the
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
irr so they are generally have separated
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
and still are serving some part of their
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
military commitment in the ing or irr
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's not the same as the reserves though
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit different the inactive
 
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
my follow-up is uh
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
would this legislation impact uh an
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
individual as opposed to a unit in other
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
words if there was a need for somebody
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
with a medical background or a special a
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
would this legislation impact the
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
activation of an individual in your view
 
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:42.709 align:start position:0%
activation of an individual in your view
so

01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
i think it would the the the legislation
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
is written such that the governor would
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
have to consent to any federalization of
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
any member of the national guard so the
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
short answer to your question is yes i
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
could go back and read it again but uh
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say units it says guard
 
01:44:59.679 --> 01:45:01.990 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say units it says guard
members

01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you mr perry for uh uh for
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
your testimony and particular questions
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for recognizing me
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
i would just want to you could briefly
 
01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:22.229 align:start position:0%
i would just want to you could briefly
explain

01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
explain
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
the um the dual enlistment principle
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
i could i could not explain that i have
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
not read the stephen's decision so i i
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
have no no basis to you know without

more simply
um

01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
do guardsmen take two oats and if they
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
do take too old so which entities do
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
they take those votes
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
they take so the guard swears an oath to

what's the consequence of taking these
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
two worlds what kind of responsibilities
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%

well you know i i i don't have the state
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
oath committed to memory i apologize but
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
once again just for the record my name
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%

uh of hooksett uh 25 year
 
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
air force veteran and today
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
again i'm representing the state
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee um unlike
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
the previous bill that we talked about
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
where we actually were in a meeting and
 
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
we had a vote and it was a unanimous
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
vote for this one because this came on
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
before we had a chance to it was after
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
we had before we got the language and
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
after we had our january meeting we sent
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
the bill around electronically to the 19
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
voting members of our uh our committee i
 
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
heard back from 15 of the 19 members and
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
all unanimously opposed the bill
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh and the reasons that they said that
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
is because primarily since desert storm
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
we've we've downsized the military to
 
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
the point where you'll hear a lot of
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
people use the total force
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
concept words which means the guard the
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
reserve and the active force what it
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
means is if you were to sit down and
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
drop all of the missions that our
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
military has to defend our country and
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
our interests worldwide you would find
 
01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
that we have more things to do than we
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
have people to actually do them so we
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
rely especially in the air force we rely
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
on the the national guard
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
every day if you're flying on an air
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
force airplane some place across across
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
the ocean you might have a guard crew
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
you might have a reserve crew you might
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
have an active duty crew you might have
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
a mixed crew you might not know who is
 
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
in fact flying this airplane it could be
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
a peas airplane being flown by active
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
duty people even though pease is a guard
 
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
base and the truth is as as as uh as
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
cole perry said you know that the the
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire didn't pay for
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
these kc-46s
 
01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
any more than the state of vermont paid
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
for the brand new f-35s they have
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
sitting on their ramp okay we need these
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
people to do uh the total the total
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
awards here um and so so basically
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
the flavor i got from my members is that
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
this this bill unnecessarily ties the
 
01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:40.390 align:start position:0%
this this bill unnecessarily ties the
hands

01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
hands
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
of uh of the governor or the state or
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
the of the guard
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
in in ways that we we really can't
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
foresee just sitting here uh around a
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
table or around a zoom screen
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
the flavor i got from all my members is
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
we're trying to solve a problem that
 
01:49:58.709 --> 01:49:58.719 align:start position:0%
does not exist
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
we're probably we're trying to add
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
legislation into something that that is
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
not an issue uh there's there's no unit
 
01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
and colonel perry can can disagree with
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
this if you want under as far as i know
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
there's no unit deployment uh to
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
overseas um of our guard units as a
 
01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:18.870 align:start position:0%
overseas um of our guard units as a
group

01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
that isn't coordinated well in advance
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
with not only the state but the but the
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
active forces everybody knows it you
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
might have a onesie or twozy
 
01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:28.629 align:start position:0%
might have a onesie or twozy
uh

01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
individual specific skill set that we
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
need somewhere that doesn't get
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
coordinated well in advance but all the
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
rest of the stuff is coordinated well in
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
advance the governor is on board with
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
with every decision that's being made
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
here because he's briefed on everything
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%

a little bit about my background i
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
served in a hybrid capacity active duty
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
and national guard reserve
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
over the course of 33 years and four
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
months exactly one third of a century
 
01:51:45.679 --> 01:51:47.109 align:start position:0%
months exactly one third of a century
and

01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh with my time in the guard and in the
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
reserves uh i have a pretty deep
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of the role of the guard
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the reserve as part of the integrated
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
force structure of the united states
 
01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.550 align:start position:0%
force structure of the united states
military

01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
military
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
it was designed that way post-vietnam so
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
it made it politically more difficult to
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
go to war because it would require the
 
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
public support
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the nation in order to allow guard
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
and reserve to be called up and deployed
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
and so there was an understanding at the
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
very outset uh
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
of the in the in the 60s and 70s
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
of needing to diversify what kind of
 
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.430 align:start position:0%
of needing to diversify what kind of
capability

01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
capability
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
each of the components guard reserve
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
active duty you know what what they
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
would bring to the table knowing that in
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
order to have a whole set needed for war
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
you had to bring them all up
 
01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.750 align:start position:0%
you had to bring them all up
and

01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
so uh the the reason
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
i am a supporter of this bill
 
01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:54.550 align:start position:0%
i am a supporter of this bill
is

01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh that i think we need to have a
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
conversation that we have gotten further
 
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
and further away
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
from some key core fundamental
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional principles one of which
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
is that the declaration of war
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
is the obligation
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
and duty of the congress and and they've
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
forfeited that since world war ii
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh and i would like the governor of new
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire to have in his quiver
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
the argument
 
01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:26.470 align:start position:0%
the argument
that

01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
we shall not as the people of new
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire deploy our forces in harm's
 
01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:31.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire deploy our forces in harm's
way

01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:53:35.589 --> 01:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
unless the congress has done its job
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
first to declare war
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
and um and so so um
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
so i'm not a peacenik uh i volunteered
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
go to afghanistan and leave my family
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
for a year
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
because i believed in what we were
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
to convert that into a stable nation
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
with equal protection under the law
 
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
and uh i thought it was a worthwhile
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
endeavor i did that personally i
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
volunteered for that but uh but i would
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
like us to know
 
01:54:07.199 --> 01:54:07.990 align:start position:0%
like us to know
that

01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.109 align:start position:0%
that
[Music]

01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
history has shown
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
that executive power often uses
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
military adventures
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
as a political tool to bind their
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
domestic politics and although we've not
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily seen that in our recent
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
history i i don't know i can't predict
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
the future and so i would like us to
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
recognize that the reason the
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
declaration of war was given to the
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
congress was to make sure that the
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
public stayed behind it
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
and and i would like uh our
 
01:54:43.199 --> 01:54:44.149 align:start position:0%
and and i would like uh our
governor

01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
to just have another option to say
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
thanks but no thanks
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh get your act together declare war and
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
we're all in with you so
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
so this is the beginning of a
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
conversation i hope you give due
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
consideration to uh representative
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
craig's bill i i think i think there's a
 
01:55:06.149 --> 01:55:06.159 align:start position:0%
good discussion to be had from it so
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you i'll take questions if
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
there if there happen to be any
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
well yeah thank you uh while you were
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
speaking i was trying to find in my u.s
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
constitution yeah you know it always
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
pops into you when you're not looking
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
for something but anyways uh it looks
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
like brody or representative deshales
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
wait say that again
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
it looks like representative details may
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
have a question but you see him better
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
than i do okay but i'm the chairman i'm
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
speaking right now thank you
 
01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh but anyways um i'm i'm asking you
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
here uh on there's a section under
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
section two under to come in um
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
the um commander in chief there
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
that talks about the seven states that
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
and he takes control of the militia
 
01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:50.149 align:start position:0%
and he takes control of the militia
um

01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out where you're
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
coming from on this versus you know what
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
all the money that the state gets
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
and the governor is involved so i'm
 
01:56:00.310 --> 01:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
trying to see where i'm missing
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
something there you being former
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
military that's why
 
01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm not interested in the money
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
aspect of this i mean i i know that
 
01:56:11.109 --> 01:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
people who are charged on a day-to-day
 
01:56:11.119 --> 01:56:12.070 align:start position:0%
people who are charged on a day-to-day
basis

01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh have to think about the money but
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think uh
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
the testimony indicated anything about
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
money being a problem until the governor
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
invoked a decision to say no
 
01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
so there's not a money issue unless the
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
governor perceives such an important
 
01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
public policy reason that um he or she
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
chooses not to deploy the force and then
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
a money issue may arise i believe i
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
and in any case um when we're talking
 
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:44.310 align:start position:0%
about uh
uh

01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
going to war
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
sending our young to war
 
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh even some of the old people um
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
i think there are bigger issues at play
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
than money i i
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't i i it creates images
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
of a mercenary force and i know that's
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
not the intent um but that that's kind
 
01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
of where it takes me thinking when we
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
start talking about money in this
 
01:57:05.599 --> 01:57:06.790 align:start position:0%
start talking about money in this
context

01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
so and a follow-up for me is what you're
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
saying is don't comply
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh no sir no sir i'm saying the opposite
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
i say comply with the constitution
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
make make congress declare war if we're
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to deploy
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
soldiers overseas into a hostile fire
 
01:57:30.719 --> 01:57:31.669 align:start position:0%
soldiers overseas into a hostile fire
zone

01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
zone
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
that i'm i'm pro-constitution very much
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
so this bill is very consistent with uh
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
with constitutional principles i believe
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir question for you yeah
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for recognizing me
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for your
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
own research today and for answering
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
our questions um so i was just wondering
 
01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
um do you know
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
which um part of uh
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
section two
 
01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:03.669 align:start position:0%
section two
um

01:58:03.669 --> 01:58:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
oh do you know what part of article 1
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
and uh section 8 currently governs
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
how our national guard for federal armed
 
01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
forces are who has the role in deploying
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
as a constitutional matter
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
or as a legal matter
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
i am not an attorney
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to your question i
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's a fair question but uh more
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate for somebody who's uh
 
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
united states supreme court president
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
and federal law and once
 
01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:56.390 align:start position:0%
and federal law and once
uh

01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
national guard units are called
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
effective duty is guarded it is um
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
governed by article 1 section 8 laws 12
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
of our constitution rather than what uh
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
hb 580 says which said it will be an
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
which was called the
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
militia clause um this would be a direct
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
challenge if we change what flaws
 
01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
in this specific section and article
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
that our governor advised by this would
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
directly challenge um
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
years of past precedence years of
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
federal laws and um even you know it
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
would be unorthodox compared to how
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
other states operate and how we regulate
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
our homeless forces so i'm wondering do
 
01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:40.719 align:start position:0%
you think this challenge is
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
something that should be done
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
even though that it could result in us
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
losing millions of dollars that we used
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
to pay these guard units and the people
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
who are in our national guard and say
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
so i would love to be sitting in in your
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
shoes there and having the opportunity
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
to hear the testimony of a bunch of
 
02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:02.790 align:start position:0%
to hear the testimony of a bunch of
different

02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
points of view on this i think it's a
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
great and vital discussion and i support
 
02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
it i support the principle that the
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
governor should be allowed to say no uh
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
if congress has failed to do its duty to
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
declare war that that that's that's
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
where i'm coming from and i i i don't
 
02:00:22.229 --> 02:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
have much
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
depth beyond that to offer you i i
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
apologize for that
 
02:00:28.229 --> 02:00:28.239 align:start position:0%

02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative al by hearing all four of
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
his bills rather than
 
02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:24.470 align:start position:0%
his bills rather than
um

02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
you know go to lunch but the thing is
 
02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's no uh the cafeteria is closed
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
right you know i mean because i i
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
respect for our members to give them a
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
lunch break i know all the democrats
 
02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
that chose not to show up here
 
02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
you know i mean uh they can just walk
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
into their refrigerator and eat
 
02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:41.270 align:start position:0%
into their refrigerator and eat
but

02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
we republicans all chose to come here
 
02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:44.149 align:start position:0%
we republicans all chose to come here
and

02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
do the things that we were elected to i
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
think personally you know you've done a
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
wonderful job as a chair
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
of all of the times i've served with you
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
and i think it's only fair that maybe
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
you get on the phone who wants some
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
i think that there are members uh
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
representative master miller since he
 
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
didn't show you she just had the pizza
 
02:08:14.069 --> 02:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
delivered for us
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
i think that there are other members who
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:20.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%

want to go against what the speaker told
 
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
me uh that
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
nobody would be testifying in our
 
02:09:04.149 --> 02:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
committee and they would be doing it
 
02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%

02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank each and every one of you for
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%

02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
what you elected for
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
and general stock outside is probably
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
probably all there
 
02:09:21.189 --> 02:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
because they there was flues they were
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%

02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
they never turned back and said oh no
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%

02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
viruses and things like that
 
02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know we still fought the laws and
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%

02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%

stark at bennington so
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
that statue resonates with
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%

gonna try to decipher what you're to see
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
okay but i'm going to go ahead and
 
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.709 --> 02:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee i'm
 
02:11:32.719 --> 02:11:36.550 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee i'm
representative

02:11:36.550 --> 02:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:38.330 align:start position:0%
i'm introducing
 
02:11:38.330 --> 02:11:50.830 align:start position:0%
i'm introducing
[Music]

02:11:50.830 --> 02:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh has been uh submitted by 15 other
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
state legislators
 
02:11:59.589 --> 02:11:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
general public
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
there are three patterns
 
02:12:08.310 --> 02:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
my reasoning being for submitting this
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
is now facing
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
a thirty trillion dollar grant
 
02:12:31.350 --> 02:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh 84 thousand dollars
 
02:13:00.310 --> 02:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:02.149 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
james madison originally marketed five
 
02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:05.350 align:start position:0%
james madison originally marketed five
said

02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
congress had the power to submit
 
02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:09.510 align:start position:0%
congress had the power to submit
amendments

02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
the perfect way to put
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
james madison right before the
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
constitution was about to be gratified
 
02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:29.270 align:start position:0%
constitution was about to be gratified
he

02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
to turn into a creative writing effort
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh this would not mean
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's possible that congress could do a
 
02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
creative writing force for that this is
 
02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:54.390 align:start position:0%
creative writing force for that this is
not

02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:54.400 --> 02:14:04.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:57.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any question
 
02:14:58.320 --> 02:14:59.030 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any question
there's

02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:14:59.040 --> 02:14:59.910 align:start position:0%
there's
this

02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:15:08.470 --> 02:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
but the this concern that we heard over
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
and over again at a
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:27.669 --> 02:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
that's kind of like saying you have an
 
02:15:27.679 --> 02:15:28.950 align:start position:0%
that's kind of like saying you have an
emergency

02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
and you can call back
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
around the country
 
02:15:48.639 --> 02:15:57.030 align:start position:0%
around the country
have

02:15:57.030 --> 02:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.040 --> 02:15:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
congress delegate this one out to the
 
02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
convention of the states uh i'm also
 
02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.719 --> 02:16:32.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:16:32.070 --> 02:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
though there's a slight possibility on
 
02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
other applications that they might even
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
aggregate this convention of the states
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh this is definitely not
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
hcr one i think is a
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that this is the one
 
02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:53.910 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that this is the one
application

02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
did you ever see the question oh is he
 
02:16:55.439 --> 02:16:56.790 align:start position:0%
did you ever see the question oh is he
done

02:16:56.790 --> 02:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry yeah i i couldn't hear you
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i apologize so hopefully the rest
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
of my committee did
 
02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
you know like i said myself to my
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
hearing if you notice i always look at
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
people's face that's why you have to get
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
mass there so uh but anyways uh are
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:17:21.669 --> 02:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
sure um you have to if you can just
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
the risk foreign hazard from such a
 
02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:30.389 align:start position:0%
the risk foreign hazard from such a
convention

02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
convention
 
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
as i said in my testimony on other
 
02:17:39.509 --> 02:17:39.519 align:start position:0%
applications i would like to have
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
so the only hazard on this one is
 
02:18:24.559 --> 02:18:26.389 align:start position:0%
so the only hazard on this one is
that

02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's a hazard or not
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
um is that congress could write it and
 
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
the term limits amendment were balanced
 
02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
by the amendment in such a way that it
 
02:18:36.629 --> 02:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
and then they send it down to
 
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
they they realize that we're people
 
02:18:47.589 --> 02:18:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:47.599 --> 02:18:48.389 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
accused that they didn't
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh they might choose state ratifying
 
02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
manuals and put an amendment that
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any teeth
 
02:18:58.080 --> 02:18:59.750 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any teeth
so

02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
the the danger is that they'll just
 
02:19:03.509 --> 02:19:03.519 align:start position:0%
continue to breathe
 
02:19:29.349 --> 02:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:46.709 --> 02:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
i would say that there's no reason
 
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
there's no risk
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's no downside on this one there
 
02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:54.550 align:start position:0%
there's no downside on this one there
are

02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
there out of 600 applications there are
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
some where they should call for generic
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think that there's a
 
02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:08.070 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think that there's a
risk

02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
risk
 
02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:08.870 align:start position:0%
risk
uh

02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
there's an outside possibility that they
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
can take one of these funds with all
 
02:20:29.110 --> 02:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
we already have potential hundred years
 
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
of runaway
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
conference congress
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
san constitutional amendments down space
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
company just want to do it
 
02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:40.469 align:start position:0%
company just want to do it
um

02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
usually congress is responding to we and
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:10.479 --> 02:21:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
responses

02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
if they said we're going to disregard
 
02:21:19.359 --> 02:21:20.630 align:start position:0%
if they said we're going to disregard
this

02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
amendment you could make that
 
02:21:22.319 --> 02:21:50.309 align:start position:0%
amendment you could make that
legislation

02:21:50.309 --> 02:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%

02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:27.110 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:22:28.469 --> 02:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
so i'll um
 
02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
i have kind of a twofold question i'll
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
ask for a follow-up mr chairman but
 
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for recognizing me mr chairman
 
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you our representative
 
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today for taking that
 
02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
question um is there any guidelines or
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions in article 5 convention as
 
02:22:44.630 --> 02:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
laid out in the uh constitution and what
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
is the latitude of action that the
 
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
convention can take when amending our
 
02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
rights in the constitution we're mending
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
how our countries operate
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
um that's a fantastic question um
 
02:22:58.389 --> 02:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
on the second part of that what latitude
 
02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
do they have the constitution actually
 
02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
restricts what can be done for example
 
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
the 17th amendment we used to elect our
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
senators indirectly
 
02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
and in other words voters went through
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
the state legislature to elect senators
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
because the senate was just supposed to
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
be a check on the power of all the other
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
parts of the government
 
02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
the senate became more and more powerful
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
so the 17th amendment was just just
 
02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
clearly violates uh the constitution in
 
02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
so the constitution
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
says you can't pass the 17th amendment
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
that went through it was an active new
 
02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:35.590 align:start position:0%
that went through it was an active new
year

02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:37.030 align:start position:0%
year
so

02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
that's taken away
 
02:23:40.630 --> 02:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
part of our ability to use the state
 
02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:42.070 align:start position:0%
part of our ability to use the state
legislatures

02:23:42.070 --> 02:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
legislatures
 
02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
government so even though the
 
02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
constitution on paper it says you can't
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
do this
 
02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:49.270 align:start position:0%
do this
um

02:23:49.270 --> 02:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
political class kind of did it
 
02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:52.790 align:start position:0%
political class kind of did it
um

02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
roe v wade's another example where
 
02:23:55.520 --> 02:23:56.870 align:start position:0%
roe v wade's another example where
um

02:23:56.870 --> 02:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
although the constitution says this you
 
02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
don't speak up a little louder oh and
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm too far from microphone right now it
 
02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:05.990 align:start position:0%
i'm too far from microphone right now it
does

02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:07.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:09.190 --> 02:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
so the constitution has all these
 
02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
protections in
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
but if
 
02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
the bulk of people in washington dc just
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
continue to disregard it and even if the
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
us supreme court doesn't enforce it it
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't get enforced all right thank you
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
did i have a follow-up right so i just
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
want to point out one thing is that two
 
02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
men needs to make a change so obviously
 
02:24:29.349 --> 02:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
if they you know
 
02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
if our federal government you know
 
02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
decides to make a change for a
 
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
constitution and it goes you know with
 
02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
direct transition position to a you know
 
02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
past uh
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
to pass clause and constitution and
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
existing class the point of the
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is to make a change so you
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
know to um
 
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
improve the constitution or you know
 
02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
however but my other question is um how
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
would rules be adopted for such a
 
02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional on foreign
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
is there specific guidelines in the
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
constitution that's saying that when
 
02:25:02.950 --> 02:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
he had a state and a number of states
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
asked for a constitutional change to be
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
made what's preventing such a convention
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
from adopting rules that give them
 
02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
unlimited latitude to change the
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
constitution however they want is there
 
02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
any kind of guideline restrictions
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
within the constitution let's say do you
 
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
only in this article 5
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
convention address this specific issue
 
02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
or can they enter into a convention and
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
just have a wide latitude of rules and
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
make what kind of memorables for working
 
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
and mending the constitution as they'd
 
02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:32.150 align:start position:0%
and mending the constitution as they'd
like

02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
they they can submit all sorts of things
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
um please yep um
 
02:25:41.429 --> 02:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
should i not speak
 
02:25:43.270 --> 02:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of it please okay
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
so the question is you know
 
02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
if i'm correct could it turn into a
 
02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
runaway convention just on their own
 
02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
rules um
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
article 5 sorry
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
articles of confederation
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh allow the runaway convention
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
and james madison when he wrote this
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
decided he didn't want to have a runway
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
convention so he's very clear about
 
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
we can call for an amendment a specific
 
02:26:18.309 --> 02:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
amendment for proposing amendments
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
there are four types of applications one
 
02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:21.830 align:start position:0%
there are four types of applications one
is

02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:22.710 align:start position:0%
is
uh

02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:24.790 --> 02:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
just a handful of states that call for
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
an open convention
 
02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention where they can
 
02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:29.110 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention where they can
do

02:26:29.110 --> 02:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:31.510 align:start position:0%
pretty much
anything

02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
um and they're most applications are
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
based on a purpose or a general issue
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
some say
 
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
here's what we want change specifically
 
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
like a pro-life amendment or something
 
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
and then a few the state legislature
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
will actually write the wording to put
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
quote unquote exactly what they want
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
inserted in the constitution
 
02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:52.630 align:start position:0%
inserted in the constitution
um

02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:53.990 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:55.830 --> 02:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think that the
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
just a general constitutional convention
 
02:26:59.670 --> 02:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
application is a good idea and i'm not
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
sure that that even complies with
 
02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
article five i think that that you have
 
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
to have a specific purpose and you have
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
here's what we want here's what we're
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
willing to ratify when it comes back
 
02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:12.150 align:start position:0%
willing to ratify when it comes back
um

02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
and by the way when you need three
 
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
quarters of the states to ratify
 
02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
there's never been as i said there's
 
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
never been an article 5 convention
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's never been a convention of the
 
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
states but when congress has sent
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
amendments down
 
02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:27.590 align:start position:0%
amendments down
that

02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
the state legislatures didn't agree with
 
02:27:31.030 --> 02:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
they just
 
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
there's no way that you're going to get
 
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
three quarters of the states to ratify
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
either by
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh state legislature or nominating or
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
ratifying convention there's no way that
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to get it approved if they
 
02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
send anything other than
 
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
essentially what we've sent up there
 
02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
oh god yeah um thank you again for you
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
know my question thank you for
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
recognizing again mr chairman so
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
basically what i'm taking away from this
 
02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:27:59.750 --> 02:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
there is no set guideline to how an
 
02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention works other than
 
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
current interpretation by scholars there
 
02:28:06.469 --> 02:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
are scholars who might say that they
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
have a lot of latitude their people
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
might describe the opinion that you have
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
that you know there has to be specific
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
latitude with purpose but it has been
 
02:28:17.349 --> 02:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
tested so in theory
 
02:28:17.359 --> 02:28:18.469 align:start position:0%
tested so in theory
could

02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
a constitutional convention decide that
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to convene for a purpose
 
02:28:25.110 --> 02:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
of something but then adopt rules with a
 
02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
wide latitude as i can see um
 
02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's never happened um about article 5
 
02:28:32.950 --> 02:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
conventions narco 5 conventions never
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
happened interpreting it the way
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
congress has the closest we had to a
 
02:28:38.950 --> 02:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
convention in the states was the u.s
 
02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
senate for the first
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
130 years 120 years or so
 
02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:44.950 align:start position:0%
130 years 120 years or so
um

02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of how
 
02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
when we were sending our deputies to
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
washington dc wherever the location will
 
02:28:54.790 --> 02:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
we can kind of predict how they would
 
02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
behave because we already know
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
we had the u.s senate for 130 years that
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
were deputies sent by the state
 
02:29:04.389 --> 02:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
legislatures and they were usually state
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislators we sent
 
02:29:09.190 --> 02:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
up up to up to uh congress to limit the
 
02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
power of the federal government
 
02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:12.710 align:start position:0%
power of the federal government
um

02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:14.389 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh what rules are in place essentially
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
is it's all the states choosing the
 
02:29:21.429 --> 02:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
deputies it's it's the people it's john
 
02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
ada john adams and thomas jefferson had
 
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
two different ways of limiting
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
government um jefferson wanted the bill
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
of rights by the way the bill of rights
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
came out of
 
02:29:30.399 --> 02:29:31.510 align:start position:0%
came out of
um

02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
virginia new york applying
 
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
for a general broad purpose hey we need
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
a bill of rights out of the constitution
 
02:29:40.630 --> 02:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
um that was done through article five
 
02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:41.910 align:start position:0%
um that was done through article five
um

02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:43.349 --> 02:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
jefferson thought that a bill of rights
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
would restrain federal power because he
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
just wanted to protect the rights of the
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
individual john adams was more
 
02:29:51.270 --> 02:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
interested in protecting the
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
creating the structure of government
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
where each branch acted as a check on
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
the power of the other so we got both we
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
got both the federal system and a
 
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
republican all right
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
we've got to move on if i may uh
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative lebranch
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:11.429 --> 02:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair and thank you uh
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative abramson for coming to
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
introduce the spill or this uh house
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution
 
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh my question is to address the fears
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
of many people
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
of a runaway convention i personally
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
don't believe that that is a concern
 
02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh so my question is
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh isn't any proposed amendment coming
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
from a convention having to be adopted
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
by the several states afterwards
 
02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
yes has to be adopted by 38 states
 
02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:40.710 align:start position:0%
yes has to be adopted by 38 states
unfortunately

02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
congress gets to choose either by state
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
ratifying convention
 
02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
either the state ratifying convention or
 
02:30:50.309 --> 02:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
the uh state legislature they've almost
 
02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
always gone with state legislatures um
 
02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:55.270 align:start position:0%
always gone with state legislatures um
but

02:30:55.270 --> 02:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:30:57.110 --> 02:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
i there with some of the other
 
02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
applications that are out there there
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
actually is a risk
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
some of the other applications there i
 
02:31:03.429 --> 02:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
think there are four or five out there
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
from other state legislatures that do
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
call for just a constitutional
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
convention with no purpose
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
um so i think that we have to be careful
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
with how we word these
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
um and i have with both hcr 1 and hcr4
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
to be very specific not just what is the
 
02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
purpose you know not just what is the
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
issue but here's what we want the
 
02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to do
 
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
so that that's out there in front of the
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
public and then when that matter comes
 
02:31:32.230 --> 02:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
back to the state legislatures or goes
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
back to the voters the voters can see
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
were you really following your the
 
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
instruction sent that we sent through
 
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
our state legislatures
 
02:31:41.590 --> 02:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
or did you just
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know come up with a ban on ar-15s or
 
02:31:47.349 --> 02:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
something that you just wanted to do
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
you know i i think that uh
 
02:31:52.389 --> 02:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
what is it 34
 
02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
states are republican right now 30 yeah
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
34 so there would be 34 the delegates
 
02:31:59.190 --> 02:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
would be republican
 
02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
so i think what would come back would
 
02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
probably be
 
02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
more conservative leaning
 
02:32:07.270 --> 02:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
favoring limited government
 
02:32:08.830 --> 02:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of what comes
 
02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
back um
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
but you might get something that's
 
02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:13.270 align:start position:0%
but you might get something that's
bipartisan

02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
um but i
 
02:32:17.429 --> 02:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
i think the rules were pretty clear that
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know right from 1789
 
02:32:22.630 --> 02:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh whatever comes back from either
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
congress or a convention of the states
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
would have to stick to whatever
 
02:32:30.309 --> 02:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
plan the legislature specified
 
02:32:33.270 --> 02:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
all right like um jay repeat that for
 
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
number three no no that's that's right
 
02:32:39.590 --> 02:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh if i may i want to ask you um
 
02:32:41.270 --> 02:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
just so you know new hampshire had did
 
02:32:43.349 --> 02:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
have a convention um constitutional
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
convention back in 1978
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
and what that brought was article 73a
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
you operated the damage that's into the
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and the judicial
 
02:32:56.230 --> 02:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
system yeah and that's actually an
 
02:32:59.190 --> 02:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
excellent point the voters approved
 
02:32:59.200 --> 02:33:00.389 align:start position:0%
excellent point the voters approved
sorry

02:33:00.389 --> 02:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
you're right on the state constitutional
 
02:33:04.870 --> 02:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
convention which follows a different
 
02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
path the voters only approve the first
 
02:33:10.230 --> 02:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
two sentences of uh was it article 73 or
 
02:33:12.870 --> 02:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
73 right yeah and then
 
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
the third sentence which basically gives
 
02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:16.950 align:start position:0%
the third sentence which basically gives
the

02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:33:19.349 --> 02:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court
 
02:33:21.270 --> 02:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know the power of law
 
02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely absurd and
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
runs contrary to the rest of the
 
02:33:28.469 --> 02:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
constitution but that that's uh that's
 
02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
this one that's the state constitution
 
02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
and second
 
02:33:33.590 --> 02:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't follow the process at all
 
02:33:35.270 --> 02:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm not quite sure how that third
 
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
sentence got in there it's never been
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
randomized okay thank you
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
you don't have to answer this and the
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
reason why i bring this up for all the
 
02:33:43.429 --> 02:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
listeners to know
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
what happened in new hampshire that the
 
02:33:47.349 --> 02:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
supreme court now
 
02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
the rules so promulgated shall have the
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
force and effect of the law
 
02:33:53.910 --> 02:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
just to give you an idea of what the
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
cartesian adventure did to new hampshire
 
02:33:58.150 --> 02:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
okay if there were any are there any
 
02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:34:03.830 --> 02:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you thank you mr speaker
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:10.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
he just said that
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
this event happened in new hampshire
 
02:34:21.270 --> 02:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:24.790 --> 02:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
but i read the and believe me i'm no
 
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional lawyer but i read the
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know one sentence that is article
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
5 in our constitution
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
and although it's a long sentence
 
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
detail any specific procedures
 
02:34:43.830 --> 02:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
i mean it details some authority
 
02:34:46.469 --> 02:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
is there another document that details
 
02:34:48.309 --> 02:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what has to happen during the
 
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
convention and has that has there been
 
02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
any definitive rulings from the supreme
 
02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:53.750 align:start position:0%
any definitive rulings from the supreme
court

02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:54.630 align:start position:0%
court
on

02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:01.750 --> 02:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
before he answers that if any members
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
brought in lunch you want to get up and
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
go eat your lunch please do that
 
02:35:08.230 --> 02:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh because this is going on a lot
 
02:35:10.389 --> 02:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
longer than we expected so
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
and any members that are watching
 
02:35:13.750 --> 02:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
i won't hurt me if you've eaten a
 
02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:15.110 align:start position:0%
i won't hurt me if you've eaten a
sandwich

02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
sandwich
 
02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:16.230 align:start position:0%
sandwich
right

02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's an excellent question um
 
02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
we've we've talked about that the
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
article five group um there's never been
 
02:35:25.030 --> 02:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
an article five convention like i say
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
some of the other applications that are
 
02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
out there
 
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
could lead to a convention of the states
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
hcr one will never lead to a convention
 
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
in the states congress would never allow
 
02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
it but but what would happen
 
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
hypothetically is
 
02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:39.270 align:start position:0%
hypothetically is
um

02:35:39.270 --> 02:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:40.630 --> 02:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
i think it would just operate like all
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
the other legislative bodies where
 
02:35:45.030 --> 02:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's just assumed we have the right to
 
02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
kind of come up with our own
 
02:35:48.389 --> 02:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
house rules
 
02:35:49.830 --> 02:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
so to speak if they're going to follow
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
masons or not if that if if you're
 
02:35:53.990 --> 02:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
referring to the procedure whether or
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
not it gets broken up into committees
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
and subcommittees and task forces and
 
02:36:00.389 --> 02:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing
 
02:36:01.910 --> 02:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason why some state
 
02:36:03.910 --> 02:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
legislatures will only submit an
 
02:36:05.429 --> 02:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
application says
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
here's the wording that we want so that
 
02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
all the discussion happens here at the
 
02:36:12.309 --> 02:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
legislative one members of the committee
 
02:36:14.230 --> 02:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
want to change this application to
 
02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
something that's really specific
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
to do that that's fine but
 
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
as far as there being
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know some document out there already
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
that would set the rules and procedure
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
for how the convention of the states
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
would operate even where they would meet
 
02:36:29.349 --> 02:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
none of that is set that would just kind
 
02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
of have to be
 
02:36:32.309 --> 02:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
um so there is no set procedure from my
 
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
understanding and you're telling me that
 
02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
we're absolutely sure it wouldn't go
 
02:36:47.270 --> 02:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
 
02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:48.389 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
but

02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
i hear that from a lot of people on
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
other matters where they say this could
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
never happen or that could never happen
 
02:36:54.870 --> 02:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
when i see it
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
so i was really looking for something
 
02:36:59.110 --> 02:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
more concrete that would
 
02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
establish that and ensure it does
 
02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:02.550 align:start position:0%
establish that and ensure it does
nothing

02:37:02.550 --> 02:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
if i can uh
 
02:37:06.870 --> 02:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
he's not a constitutional lawyer and
 
02:37:09.429 --> 02:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
okay it's an opinion that you know what
 
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
might could have happened so we'd be out
 
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
going down a different path here that
 
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
could go on and on am i right uh
 
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:17.110 align:start position:0%
could go on and on am i right uh
representative

02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:37:19.270 --> 02:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh well i i do have more knowledge of
 
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
this than
 
02:37:23.349 --> 02:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
99 of people can you answer them in 30
 
02:37:23.359 --> 02:37:24.710 align:start position:0%
99 of people can you answer them in 30
seconds

02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
02:37:27.750 --> 02:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
that we what we haven't already heard
 
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes you answered i'm saying there will
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
be other people testifying
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
know even more about her
 
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
all right thanks i just think that's
 
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's a question that could drag on and
 
02:37:42.309 --> 02:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
on opinion and without somebody actually
 
02:37:45.270 --> 02:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
did you trust me okay um seeing that
 
02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
there are no other questions i thank you
 
02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:51.520 align:start position:0%

already

02:38:53.670 --> 02:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:38:56.150 --> 02:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of information in there in
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
a short amount of time
 
02:38:59.590 --> 02:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things i want to raise is the
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
fact that we have checks and balances in
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
our government
 
02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
one of the sections in my testimony my
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
written testimony is that as we've seen
 
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
last year and again now this january the
 
02:39:12.389 --> 02:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
legislative branch has a way of checking
 
02:39:14.550 --> 02:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
the executive branch
 
02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:16.070 align:start position:0%
the executive branch
the

02:39:16.070 --> 02:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:39:18.790 --> 02:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
executive branch has a way of checking a
 
02:39:21.510 --> 02:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
legislative branch with a veto
 
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
and the judiciary can send things back
 
02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
to the legislative branch and what
 
02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
article 5
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
allows us to do as the people allows you
 
02:39:35.349 --> 02:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
as the state legislatures to do around
 
02:39:36.550 --> 02:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
the country
 
02:39:39.030 --> 02:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
is to provide a method of giving we the
 
02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:39.990 align:start position:0%
is to provide a method of giving we the
people

02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:39:42.790 --> 02:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
through you the state legislatures
 
02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to put a check on all three
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the branches
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
this is a big deal as we look at 30
 
02:39:52.309 --> 02:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
million 30 30 trillion dollars in debt
 
02:39:52.319 --> 02:39:53.190 align:start position:0%
million 30 30 trillion dollars in debt
now

02:39:53.190 --> 02:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
as we look at
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
40 new executives
 
02:39:58.319 --> 02:39:59.030 align:start position:0%
40 new executives
in

02:39:59.030 --> 02:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:40:01.270 --> 02:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
well let's see it's coming up on the
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
10th day
 
02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
of this administration
 
02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a method by which
 
02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
we the people have a method of being
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
able to fix things
 
02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's been said for
 
02:40:13.270 --> 02:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
many years is the government closest to
 
02:40:15.429 --> 02:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
the people is the best government
 
02:40:17.830 --> 02:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
because we will not ever see senator
 
02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
shaheen and a hannaford or senator
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
hassan in a shaw's
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
we will see you guys
 
02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:27.990 align:start position:0%
we will see you guys
at

02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:40:30.150 --> 02:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
doors or at the home depot
 
02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
we will get to talk to you we can help
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
to influence you because you're close to
 
02:40:34.399 --> 02:40:35.510 align:start position:0%
to influence you because you're close to

02:40:43.030 --> 02:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's 8 500 now petition signers uh for
 
02:40:45.590 --> 02:40:45.600 align:start position:0%

that's great right
 
02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'll go a little faster i'm a resident
 
02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
of uh east kingston new hampshire for
 
02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
the record but 233 years ago we became
 
02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
the ninth state to ratify this
 
02:43:57.590 --> 02:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
constitution of the united states so in
 
02:43:59.429 --> 02:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
essence new hampshire had a very leading
 
02:44:01.590 --> 02:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
role in that we actually physically put
 
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
the constitution in force in the
 
02:44:08.070 --> 02:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
constitution article 5 empowers
 
02:44:10.469 --> 02:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
the states to request a convention to
 
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
propose amendments to this constitution
 
02:44:15.429 --> 02:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
i'm going to pause there for a second
 
02:44:17.190 --> 02:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
because questions came out about how
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
this can be controlled
 
02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
the control mechanism is obviously the
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
approval of those amendments and that is
 
02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:26.950 align:start position:0%
approval of those amendments and that is
the

02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:44:30.389 --> 02:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
ratification by 38 states to approve it
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
that is the major control mechanism
 
02:44:34.710 --> 02:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
but this tool was put in the
 
02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:36.469 align:start position:0%
but this tool was put in the
constitution

02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
02:44:36.479 --> 02:44:37.510 align:start position:0%
constitution
as

02:44:37.510 --> 02:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
a way for the uh for the states to
 
02:44:43.750 --> 02:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
restrain a runaway federal government
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
the power this power was actually
 
02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
retained by the states it wasn't given
 
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
to the states because the states had all
 
02:44:51.110 --> 02:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
the power
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
as a check on federal power
 
02:44:56.870 --> 02:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
by all reasonable measures i think we
 
02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
can all agree
 
02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
in many aspects of federal government
 
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
is already run away
 
02:45:05.030 --> 02:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
as state legislators
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
we citizens of new hampshire empower you
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
with responsibility to protect our
 
02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:11.349 align:start position:0%
with responsibility to protect our
interests

02:45:11.349 --> 02:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
interests
 
02:45:13.750 --> 02:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
from the excesses of the runaway federal
 
02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:14.870 align:start position:0%
from the excesses of the runaway federal
government

02:45:14.870 --> 02:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
the only tool in your tool shed
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
is article five
 
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
that is a way you can constrain a
 
02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
runaway federal government
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
personally i feel as your moral
 
02:45:29.349 --> 02:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
obligation to act
 
02:45:32.230 --> 02:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
to check a runaway federal government
 
02:45:35.110 --> 02:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's morally unconscionable to me
 
02:45:37.030 --> 02:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
that you allow the federal government to
 
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
continue spending us into bankruptcy
 
02:45:43.830 --> 02:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
just in the simplest form
 
02:45:46.469 --> 02:45:46.479 align:start position:0%
we have a fox out there congress it's
 
02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
killing off the livestock
 
02:45:50.790 --> 02:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
that a farmer depends on to sustain its
 
02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:51.910 align:start position:0%
that a farmer depends on to sustain its
family

02:45:51.910 --> 02:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
family
 
02:45:53.750 --> 02:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
the farmer is given a weapon that can
 
02:45:56.230 --> 02:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
drive the fox away that weapon is
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
article five it's a powerful weapon and
 
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
the farmer feels that the fox can turn
 
02:46:03.349 --> 02:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
the weapon around on him
 
02:46:05.429 --> 02:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
what is the farmer to do does he hunker
 
02:46:07.750 --> 02:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
down in his house and keep the weapon
 
02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
sheathed hoping the problem goes away we
 
02:46:13.110 --> 02:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
all know the result will be nothing but
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
ruin for the farm and his family stars
 
02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
or the farmer can utilize the weapon
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
article 5
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
to drive the fox away
 
02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
in a legal manner that safeguards his

in a legal manner that safeguards his
family

02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
family
 
02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
we all know the correct approach
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
the family must be protected

uh my name is eric bell i am a resident
 
02:48:46.710 --> 02:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
of plaistow new hampshire adopted me
 
02:48:49.590 --> 02:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
back in 1991 and i believe is a great
 
02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
move um
 
02:48:53.110 --> 02:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
i do support a convention of states
 
02:48:55.590 --> 02:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
and you've heard different things today
 
02:48:57.520 --> 02:48:58.710 align:start position:0%
and you've heard different things today
well

02:48:58.710 --> 02:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:49:02.950 --> 02:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
my argument is really to quell a fear
 
02:49:05.670 --> 02:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
as opposed to anything more affirmative
 
02:49:07.349 --> 02:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
i believe fully in a convention of
 
02:49:10.309 --> 02:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
states article 5 convention
 
02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
there are several fears and some have
 
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
been voiced today the one i want to
 
02:49:17.269 --> 02:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
address is a runaway convention
 
02:49:20.230 --> 02:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
i believe that stems from the same
 
02:49:21.830 --> 02:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
information i was given as a child back
 
02:49:24.150 --> 02:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
in the 60s i'm a product of the 60s and
 
02:49:26.309 --> 02:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
at that time they said people were sent
 
02:49:28.630 --> 02:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
to fix the articles of confederation our
 
02:49:30.630 --> 02:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
first constitution
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
and instead they scrapped it
 
02:49:35.030 --> 02:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
in their own way and then created a
 
02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
second our second constitution the one
 
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
we live under today
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
and that was a runaway it was people
 
02:49:42.550 --> 02:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
doing the wrong thing they straight
 
02:49:44.309 --> 02:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
outside the lines of their original
 
02:49:44.319 --> 02:49:46.230 align:start position:0%
outside the lines of their original
commissions

02:49:46.230 --> 02:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to submit this evidence
 
02:49:50.469 --> 02:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
that universities the university of
 
02:49:52.469 --> 02:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
wisconsin yale university they all have
 
02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
archives of documents each of the
 
02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
commissioners the people who went to
 
02:49:59.030 --> 02:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
that congress
 
02:50:00.870 --> 02:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
to work on the
 
02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
redrafting were given commissions the
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
commissions were laid out by the
 
02:50:06.070 --> 02:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
legislatures these are documents people
 
02:50:07.750 --> 02:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
don't go places and represent other
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
people you all have documentation saying
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
you sit
 
02:50:13.269 --> 02:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
in your seats as you do because you have
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
commissions to do that you want
 
02:50:16.150 --> 02:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
elections this is the way it works the
 
02:50:18.469 --> 02:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
same thing was true for those people
 
02:50:21.349 --> 02:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
11 of those commissions there were 13 13
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
colonies 11 of those commissions
 
02:50:26.309 --> 02:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
say nothing whatsoever about maintaining
 
02:50:28.469 --> 02:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
the articles of confederation they said
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
in short i'm paraphrasing just fix the
 
02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:32.950 align:start position:0%
in short i'm paraphrasing just fix the
situation

02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:50:34.950 --> 02:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
new york and massachusetts two of the
 
02:50:37.670 --> 02:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
other three were dead set against just
 
02:50:39.110 --> 02:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
that and they wanted to fix it and rhode
 
02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
island sat out
 
02:50:43.110 --> 02:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in 1787 sent their
 
02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners again it's a one-page
 
02:50:46.870 --> 02:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
document for them that says nothing
 
02:50:49.349 --> 02:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
about maintaining a status quo
 
02:50:52.870 --> 02:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
just fix it is the summation
 
02:50:55.269 --> 02:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
and so they did they came up with a new
 
02:50:55.279 --> 02:50:56.630 align:start position:0%
and so they did they came up with a new
document

02:50:56.630 --> 02:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:50:58.469 --> 02:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
there's nothing against that
 
02:51:00.230 --> 02:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
but back in the 60s it started where
 
02:51:02.070 --> 02:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
people were being told about runaways
 
02:51:03.269 --> 02:51:03.279 align:start position:0%
and they were being told about people
 
02:51:05.429 --> 02:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
straying outside the lines and and
 
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
chairman when you talk about what
 
02:51:08.309 --> 02:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
happened in new hampshire i understand
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
that you're right to have a fear for
 
02:51:11.510 --> 02:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
what happened in new hampshire i'm only
 
02:51:13.349 --> 02:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
addressing the fear that lives within
 
02:51:15.030 --> 02:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
almost everybody that this will be a
 
02:51:17.429 --> 02:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
runaway i might have more to speak on it
 
02:51:18.870 --> 02:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
but instead i just wanted to address
 
02:51:21.349 --> 02:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
that there were strict commissions given
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
to people they stayed within their
 
02:51:25.030 --> 02:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
boundaries and they did their job
 
02:51:26.790 --> 02:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
and i thank you very much i do
 
02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that this bill get
 
02:51:32.630 --> 02:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
moved for debate in the full house
 
02:51:34.389 --> 02:51:34.399 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions thank you very
 
02:51:34.399 --> 02:51:35.349 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions thank you very
much

02:51:35.349 --> 02:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
you retain the bill or not
 
02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
so there is a
 
02:51:47.349 --> 02:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
difference there than other states but

and not
 
02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
an organization i've been in the article
 
02:52:36.790 --> 02:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
5 arena now for about 8 years i've been
 
02:52:39.510 --> 02:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
before your committee a number of times
 
02:52:41.670 --> 02:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
i want to really address
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
just one specific thing and you can look
 
02:52:46.070 --> 02:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
at my um testimony my written testimony
 
02:52:47.910 --> 02:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's about the rules one thing i hear
 
02:52:49.349 --> 02:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
often and i've heard it this morning is
 
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
that we don't have rules for an article
 
02:52:52.309 --> 02:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
5 convention
 
02:52:53.990 --> 02:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i want to explain
 
02:52:55.750 --> 02:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
why they did not put that in the
 
02:52:58.150 --> 02:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
constitution because they didn't need to
 
02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
because they were so used to having
 
02:53:02.309 --> 02:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
conventions they understood how they
 
02:53:04.309 --> 02:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
operated in fact
 
02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
our country has had hundreds of
 
02:53:08.870 --> 02:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
conventions conventions of states and uh
 
02:53:08.880 --> 02:53:09.830 align:start position:0%
conventions conventions of states and uh
even

02:53:09.830 --> 02:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
even
 
02:53:11.830 --> 02:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
most notably is the annapolis convention
 
02:53:14.710 --> 02:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
of 1786 which was called for commerce
 
02:53:14.720 --> 02:53:16.070 align:start position:0%
of 1786 which was called for commerce
issues

02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
they recommended that the philadelphia
 
02:53:21.349 --> 02:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
convention be held for the next year i
 
02:53:24.389 --> 02:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
highly recommend you read federalist 40
 
02:53:27.030 --> 02:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
by james madison he just he completely
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
refutes the charge
 
02:53:31.349 --> 02:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
that the philadelphia convention
 
02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
exceeded their authority they had full
 
02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
rights to to adopt a new constitution
 
02:53:39.590 --> 02:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
one fascinating part of history is that
 
02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
we have even had two conventions of the
 
02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
states that have met to propose a uh
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
actually several
 
02:53:49.830 --> 02:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
amendments to the u.s constitution and
 
02:53:51.510 --> 02:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has participated in both
 
02:53:52.950 --> 02:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
of them the washington peace conference
 
02:53:55.910 --> 02:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
of 1861 and the hartford convention of
 
02:53:55.920 --> 02:53:57.910 align:start position:0%
of 1861 and the hartford convention of
1814.

02:53:57.910 --> 02:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
1814.
 
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
every year a confederat
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
a convention of states is held
 
02:54:05.510 --> 02:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
all 50 states participated it's called
 
02:54:07.110 --> 02:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
it was called the national conference of
 
02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
commissioners on uniform state laws is
 
02:54:10.950 --> 02:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
more commonly known as the unifor
 
02:54:12.710 --> 02:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
uniform law commission
 
02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:14.150 align:start position:0%
uniform law commission
this

02:54:14.150 --> 02:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
body functions exactly as an article 5
 
02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
convention would function the scope is
 
02:54:20.870 --> 02:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
predetermined and limited the
 
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
commissioners are appointed by you the
 
02:54:24.469 --> 02:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
state legislatures
 
02:54:25.990 --> 02:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
or the governors but in new hampshire
 
02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's the legislature that appoints the
 
02:54:29.830 --> 02:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
commissioners they arrive and they
 
02:54:31.590 --> 02:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
present their credentials which allows
 
02:54:33.670 --> 02:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
them on what topics they are able to
 
02:54:36.630 --> 02:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
discuss draft and they debate uh uniform
 
02:54:37.990 --> 02:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
state laws
 
02:54:40.389 --> 02:54:40.399 align:start position:0%
the vote is taken by state so it's one
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
state one vote passed by a majority and
 
02:54:45.910 --> 02:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
then whatever passes those commissioners
 
02:54:48.230 --> 02:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
bring the model act back to their state
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
legislature to try to adopt it as state
 
02:54:52.389 --> 02:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
law in fact right now your house
 
02:54:53.910 --> 02:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee
 
02:54:57.990 --> 02:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
h.b 124 is a model act passed by an
 
02:55:01.590 --> 02:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
official convention of the states
 
02:55:05.429 --> 02:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
further history the state of themselves
 
02:55:07.190 --> 02:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
and this is where new hampshire just
 
02:55:10.030 --> 02:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
shines there has been
 
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
233 conventions
 
02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the states to either adopt a new
 
02:55:17.590 --> 02:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
constitution or propose amendments to
 
02:55:19.830 --> 02:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
their current constitutions
 
02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire leads the nation at 17.
 
02:55:24.550 --> 02:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
two of those conventions were called to
 
02:55:27.750 --> 02:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
adopt a new constitution and 15 of those
 
02:55:30.469 --> 02:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
were called to propose amendments out of
 
02:55:34.150 --> 02:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
those 15 conventions 261 amendments were
 
02:55:36.910 --> 02:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
proposed and the people ratified
 
02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
129 of them so
 
02:55:41.429 --> 02:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
of all the states in our country that
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
should be leading
 
02:55:45.750 --> 02:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
this charge to call an article 5
 
02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
convention should be new hampshire in
 
02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
fact in 2017
 
02:55:54.790 --> 02:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
your legislature sent seven legislators
 
02:55:57.830 --> 02:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
as delegates to another official
 
02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
convention of states the phoenix
 
02:56:03.190 --> 02:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
convention which was called by the state
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
legislature of arizona to adopt official
 
02:56:09.269 --> 02:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
rules for an article 5 convention which
 
02:56:11.670 --> 02:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
they did i would highly recommend that
 
02:56:13.269 --> 02:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
you would speak to your
 
02:56:15.030 --> 02:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
legislators that attended that they can
 
02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
provide you the
 
02:56:18.710 --> 02:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
actual rules i can send those to you as
 
02:56:21.269 --> 02:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
well if you would like there are so many
 
02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
rules that are there are actually other
 
02:56:25.269 --> 02:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
organizations like the assembly of state
 
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
legislatures that have adopted rules for
 
02:56:29.269 --> 02:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention and the american
 
02:56:31.590 --> 02:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
legislative exchange council among
 
02:56:33.750 --> 02:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
others so it's not that we don't have
 
02:56:35.030 --> 02:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
02:56:37.110 --> 02:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
what we need are people to actually
 
02:56:39.269 --> 02:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
start using these rules that are well
 
02:56:41.510 --> 02:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
established and vibrant and have been
 
02:56:44.790 --> 02:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
working for us for over 200
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
years and that is why i'm here in
 
02:56:50.070 --> 02:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
support of hcr one because
 
02:56:52.469 --> 02:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony is right what is
 
02:56:54.230 --> 02:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
it going to take to get our state
 
02:56:56.710 --> 02:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
legislatures to stand up
 
02:56:59.349 --> 02:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
to a federal government that refuses to
 
02:57:01.269 --> 02:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
listen to the will of the people
 
02:57:03.910 --> 02:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
tramples our rights our freedoms and
 
02:57:05.429 --> 02:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
it's up to you
 
02:57:09.190 --> 02:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's your duty under article 5 to defend
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
our freedoms and our liberties and to
 
02:57:13.269 --> 02:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
use the authority that the framers gave
 
02:57:13.279 --> 02:57:14.070 align:start position:0%
use the authority that the framers gave
you

02:57:14.070 --> 02:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
through this process because if you do
 
02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:17.510 align:start position:0%
through this process because if you do
not

02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:57:19.429 --> 02:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
nothing will ever change and we will
 
02:57:21.990 --> 02:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
continue into a spiral downhill so i
 
02:57:23.830 --> 02:57:23.840 align:start position:0%

02:57:26.230 --> 02:57:26.240 align:start position:0%

02:57:47.990 --> 02:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
believe me we fully understand that
 
02:57:50.230 --> 02:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
somebody's been on this committee for 14
 
02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:51.110 align:start position:0%
somebody's been on this committee for 14
years

02:57:51.110 --> 02:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:57:53.510 --> 02:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
but my question to you is
 
02:57:55.190 --> 02:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
on the convention of states that you
 
02:57:56.950 --> 02:57:56.960 align:start position:0%

02:57:58.950 --> 02:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh i mean that's just you know the 50
 
02:58:00.870 --> 02:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
states getting together and
 
02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know coming up with you know on what
 
02:58:04.710 --> 02:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
they could be or what you might want to
 
02:58:07.030 --> 02:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
bring up or whatever but the bottom line
 
02:58:09.510 --> 02:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
is it's not a constitutional convention
 
02:58:11.110 --> 02:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
because there's no requirements for
 
02:58:13.750 --> 02:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
those people that attended to go into
 
02:58:15.349 --> 02:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
that convention of states go back to
 
02:58:17.750 --> 02:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
your state and you have to file an
 
02:58:19.990 --> 02:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
amendment it's nothing that comes under
 
02:58:22.950 --> 02:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
an article 5. am i correct real yes or
 
02:58:22.960 --> 02:58:24.150 align:start position:0%
an article 5. am i correct real yes or
no

02:58:24.150 --> 02:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
are you referring to the union law
 
02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:27.990 align:start position:0%
are you referring to the union law
commission

02:58:27.990 --> 02:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:58:29.429 --> 02:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
that i referenced
 
02:58:31.269 --> 02:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
a convention of states are you talking
 
02:58:34.309 --> 02:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
about no a convention of states uh no it
 
02:58:35.910 --> 02:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
cannot be amended whatever comes out of
 
02:58:37.910 --> 02:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
that convention cannot be amended it has
 
02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
to be adopted as written and as approved
 
02:58:41.910 --> 02:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
by the convention
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
right but
 
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
follow up here what i'm trying to say in
 
02:58:47.590 --> 02:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
it but it cannot be held the states
 
02:58:50.309 --> 02:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
don't have to go back and file it like
 
02:58:52.790 --> 02:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
it would a constitutional convention am
 
02:58:55.349 --> 02:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
i right yes or no
 
02:58:57.190 --> 02:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
file what exactly i don't understand i'm
 
02:59:10.870 --> 02:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.870 --> 02:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
um so you mentioned these rules
 
02:59:17.110 --> 02:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
regarding an article 5 conventional
 
02:59:19.269 --> 02:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
convention of the states i'm not sure
 
02:59:22.230 --> 02:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
what the differentiation is there but my
 
02:59:24.230 --> 02:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
question is what is the latitude of
 
02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
action within these rules can a
 
02:59:28.710 --> 02:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
convention decide not to adopt these
 
02:59:29.830 --> 02:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
rules there's nothing in the
 
02:59:31.910 --> 02:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
constitution that requires them to put
 
02:59:33.910 --> 02:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
off these rules that you are apparently
 
02:59:36.309 --> 02:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
cited so could there be a fear that they
 
02:59:38.550 --> 02:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
just adopt a different set of rules that
 
02:59:41.030 --> 02:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
um are contrary to
 
02:59:42.790 --> 02:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
the desires of the previous rules that
 
02:59:42.800 --> 02:59:43.590 align:start position:0%
the desires of the previous rules that
you

02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:59:43.600 --> 02:59:46.630 align:start position:0%
you
cite

02:59:46.630 --> 02:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:46.640 --> 02:59:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:59:47.750 --> 02:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:59:51.269 --> 02:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
my testimony shows that we have had so
 
02:59:53.830 --> 02:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
many of these conventions of states that
 
02:59:55.910 --> 02:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
the idea that we don't understand how
 
02:59:57.830 --> 02:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
one would operate is just not based on
 
02:59:59.910 --> 02:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
any fact or logic based upon our
 
02:59:59.920 --> 03:00:01.190 align:start position:0%
any fact or logic based upon our
experience

03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
experience
 
03:00:03.910 --> 03:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
all a convention of the states is is the
 
03:00:07.030 --> 03:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
states having a meeting they draft
 
03:00:08.309 --> 03:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
a proposal
 
03:00:10.550 --> 03:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
depending on what it was called for it's
 
03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
limited to the call and you control them
 
03:00:14.630 --> 03:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
by your commissions
 
03:00:17.750 --> 03:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
so they they are actually legally bound
 
03:00:19.830 --> 03:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
they are agents of the principle the
 
03:00:22.550 --> 03:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
principle being the state legislature
 
03:00:25.349 --> 03:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
and the rules adopted would be the rules
 
03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
that your legislators have also already
 
03:00:32.630 --> 03:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
adopted in the 2017 convention or any of
 
03:00:33.670 --> 03:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
the other
 
03:00:35.349 --> 03:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
rules that have been adopted and used
 
03:00:37.269 --> 03:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
they're all very similar
 
03:00:39.510 --> 03:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
and there is really
 
03:00:41.670 --> 03:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
this is not recreating the wheel here
 
03:00:44.070 --> 03:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's quite just this is how these
 
03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
things operate and it's time we actually
 
03:01:05.429 --> 03:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:05.439 --> 03:01:06.309 align:start position:0%
 
it's

03:01:06.309 --> 03:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:01:08.070 --> 03:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
is there that a conceivable universe
 
03:01:09.670 --> 03:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
where they adopt a different set of
 
03:01:11.750 --> 03:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
rules that are different than previous
 
03:01:13.269 --> 03:01:13.279 align:start position:0%
worlds that could have competable
 
03:01:15.269 --> 03:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
outcomes that are bad for the american
 
03:01:15.279 --> 03:01:17.830 align:start position:0%
outcomes that are bad for the american
people

03:01:17.830 --> 03:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:19.990 --> 03:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
well you control which rules they adopt
 
03:01:22.550 --> 03:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
so in your commissions you could specify
 
03:01:25.349 --> 03:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
which rules to adopt so if you prefer
 
03:01:28.150 --> 03:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
the rules from the assembly of state
 
03:01:30.070 --> 03:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
legislators you can put in your
 
03:01:31.510 --> 03:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
commission that they would adopt those
 
03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
rules this can be all done ahead of time
 
03:01:36.630 --> 03:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
before the convention even meets and so
 
03:01:39.670 --> 03:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's up to the state legislatures to put
 
03:01:42.870 --> 03:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
that within their commissions
 
03:01:44.710 --> 03:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
they work for you
 
03:01:45.990 --> 03:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
03:01:47.110 --> 03:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
add on
 
03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
this is what al baldur syria but in 1784
 
03:01:53.190 --> 03:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh did they do something similar that
 
03:01:55.429 --> 03:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
new york two uh legislators or two
 
03:01:57.030 --> 03:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
voters walked away
 
03:01:58.469 --> 03:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
and then they couldn't get back in and
 
03:02:01.030 --> 03:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
all the votes were done secret
 
03:02:02.389 --> 03:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
and well
 
03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
i believe you
 
03:02:05.110 --> 03:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
i i believe you're referring to the
 
03:02:08.790 --> 03:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:02:09.590 --> 03:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:02:11.190 --> 03:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's a great example of how
 
03:02:14.309 --> 03:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
this is limited the new york delegation
 
03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
their commission only allowed them to
 
03:02:19.830 --> 03:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
revise the articles of confederation so
 
03:02:21.590 --> 03:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
they were limited by that when they
 
03:02:24.389 --> 03:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
arrived the convention was called well
 
03:02:27.349 --> 03:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
beyond ex the expansion of the articles
 
03:02:29.910 --> 03:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
and so because they were not allowed to
 
03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
go beyond revising the articles they
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
were limited and so that is why they
 
03:02:37.030 --> 03:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
left the constitutional convention in
 
03:02:39.830 --> 03:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
fact after they left new york no longer
 
03:02:41.429 --> 03:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
had a vote now
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
alexander hamilton came back and he
 
03:02:47.190 --> 03:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
signed the constitution but uh his votes
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
or his signature did not even count and
 
03:02:52.389 --> 03:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
so it was actually ratified by what 11
 
03:02:55.110 --> 03:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
11 states and so that just proves again
 
03:02:57.510 --> 03:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
how the commission of those new york
 
03:02:59.750 --> 03:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
delegates they were bound to it and that
 
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
is why they left the convention
 
03:03:03.990 --> 03:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh real quick if so uh
 
03:03:06.150 --> 03:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
if i may yes or no doesn't that prove
 
03:03:08.710 --> 03:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that then a state making up
 
03:03:10.389 --> 03:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
their own rules
 
03:03:12.150 --> 03:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
because every state is going to have 50
 
03:03:14.230 --> 03:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
separate set of rules that goes down to
 
03:03:16.230 --> 03:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
a conscious convention
 
03:03:16.240 --> 03:03:17.429 align:start position:0%
a conscious convention
that

03:03:17.429 --> 03:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have to comply with that
 
03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:20.550 align:start position:0%
they don't have to comply with that
state

03:03:20.550 --> 03:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:03:22.230 --> 03:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes or no
 
03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:24.710 align:start position:0%
uh yes or no
no

03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:28.230 --> 03:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
because the the the the states
 
03:03:30.150 --> 03:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
the commissions are not the rules of the
 
03:03:32.230 --> 03:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
convention the rules of the convention
 
03:03:35.269 --> 03:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
are adopted once the convention begins
 
03:03:37.030 --> 03:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
the commissions
 
03:03:39.429 --> 03:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
bind and only allow
 
03:03:42.309 --> 03:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
what the delegates who are sent
 
03:03:44.389 --> 03:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
it only provides them the authority to
 
03:03:47.030 --> 03:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
vote on what they were sent to do and so
 
03:03:48.150 --> 03:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
written up and drafted by this each
 
03:03:52.309 --> 03:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
state legislature giving them their
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
authority to represent the principle
 
03:03:56.870 --> 03:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
so no they it has nothing to do with the
 
03:03:56.880 --> 03:03:57.910 align:start position:0%
so no they it has nothing to do with the
rules

03:03:57.910 --> 03:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:04:00.469 --> 03:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
you could you could recommend that the
 
03:04:00.479 --> 03:04:01.830 align:start position:0%
you could you could recommend that the
delegation

03:04:01.830 --> 03:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
03:04:04.150 --> 03:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
accepts particular rules
 
03:04:05.990 --> 03:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
and then it would all be based on the
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
vote of the convention which rules to
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
adopt but the long story said we have
 
03:04:12.710 --> 03:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
the rules we know how it works we use
 
03:04:15.190 --> 03:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
them even today every single year and
 
03:04:17.750 --> 03:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's time that we finally do
 
03:04:20.070 --> 03:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh seeing that are there any
 
03:04:22.630 --> 03:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:23.510 align:start position:0%
other questions
okay

03:04:23.510 --> 03:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you ken thank you
 
03:04:28.870 --> 03:04:28.880 align:start position:0%

last night i happened to read
 
03:05:25.750 --> 03:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
in a letter that was written in
 
03:05:27.590 --> 03:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
opposition by somebody who followed the
 
03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
john birch society
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking in support of moving
 
03:05:34.710 --> 03:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
the resolution but i'd like to read his
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
comment there were two sentences
 
03:05:37.200 --> 03:05:38.389 align:start position:0%
comment there were two sentences
quote

03:05:38.389 --> 03:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
quote
 
03:05:40.550 --> 03:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
our constitution is currently much too
 
03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to a runaway an unorganized
 
03:05:42.960 --> 03:05:44.230 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to a runaway an unorganized
agenda

03:05:44.230 --> 03:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
03:05:46.870 --> 03:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
developed inserted by politically based
 
03:05:49.110 --> 03:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
special interest groups for self-serving
 
03:05:49.120 --> 03:05:50.309 align:start position:0%
special interest groups for self-serving
purposes

03:05:50.309 --> 03:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
into the whims of our corrupt
 
03:05:54.230 --> 03:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
politicians which we are becoming famous
 
03:05:54.240 --> 03:05:55.110 align:start position:0%
politicians which we are becoming famous
for

03:05:55.110 --> 03:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
03:05:59.030 --> 03:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
notice that was his first sentence and
 
03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
when i read it it strikes me as a
 
03:06:03.110 --> 03:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
perfect description of the current
 
03:06:06.150 --> 03:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
situation we have in congress
 
03:06:07.750 --> 03:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
the first sentence was followed
 
03:06:09.990 --> 03:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
immediately by the second sentence
 
03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:10.950 align:start position:0%
immediately by the second sentence
quote

03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
quote
 
03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's essential that our constitution
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
remain intact
 
03:06:16.230 --> 03:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
and exactly
 
03:06:19.190 --> 03:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
as our founding fathers provided
 
03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
his second sentence to me is the reason
 
03:06:23.990 --> 03:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
that we have the corrupt situation the
 
03:06:26.630 --> 03:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
first sentence so by his own words he
 
03:06:28.870 --> 03:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
proves that changes to the constitution
 
03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
are necessary or nothing will change
 
03:06:35.590 --> 03:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
the powers of the convention of states
 
03:06:35.600 --> 03:06:36.550 align:start position:0%
the powers of the convention of states
are

03:06:36.550 --> 03:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
very limited but they're identical to
 
03:06:41.590 --> 03:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
what we have in the congress right now
 
03:06:44.070 --> 03:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
i feel that the congress is the perfect
 
03:06:47.510 --> 03:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
example of a runaway convention
 
03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
in the congress of states we're going to
 
03:06:52.150 --> 03:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
have up to 50 people who can propose an
 
03:06:52.160 --> 03:06:53.510 align:start position:0%
have up to 50 people who can propose an
amendment

03:06:53.510 --> 03:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:06:55.910 --> 03:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the existing congress we have almost
 
03:06:58.230 --> 03:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
600 individuals who can propose an
 
03:06:58.240 --> 03:06:59.190 align:start position:0%
600 individuals who can propose an
amendment

03:06:59.190 --> 03:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:07:00.950 --> 03:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
every day
 
03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
they can propose the amendment on any
 
03:07:02.880 --> 03:07:05.349 align:start position:0%
they can propose the amendment on any
topic

03:07:05.349 --> 03:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:07.429 --> 03:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
convention that we are proposing is
 
03:07:10.070 --> 03:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
defined that will only make changes to
 
03:07:12.150 --> 03:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
an existing constitution it's not going
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
to create a new constitution
 
03:07:16.950 --> 03:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
and it's limited to three areas and
 
03:07:18.870 --> 03:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
those three areas are to limit the
 
03:07:21.269 --> 03:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
powers of the government
 
03:07:23.269 --> 03:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
we are not proposing that we
 
03:07:25.269 --> 03:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
limit anything to an individual we're
 
03:07:27.750 --> 03:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
not going to propose amendments and we'd
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to propose an amendment
 
03:07:33.190 --> 03:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
that prohibits someone from doing
 
03:07:35.429 --> 03:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
something or mandates that they do
 
03:07:35.439 --> 03:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
something or mandates that they do
something

03:07:36.710 --> 03:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:07:38.950 --> 03:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
we are limited to proposing things that
 
03:07:41.670 --> 03:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government can do and cannot
 
03:07:41.680 --> 03:07:43.510 align:start position:0%
the federal government can do and cannot
do

03:07:43.510 --> 03:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:07:43.520 --> 03:07:44.469 align:start position:0%
do
um

03:07:44.469 --> 03:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
03:07:49.590 --> 03:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
this past week ted cruz just proposed an
 
03:07:49.600 --> 03:07:50.710 align:start position:0%
this past week ted cruz just proposed an
amendment

03:07:50.710 --> 03:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:07:53.910 --> 03:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
to uh term limits
 
03:07:57.190 --> 03:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
um that's great news
 
03:07:57.200 --> 03:07:57.990 align:start position:0%
um that's great news
but

03:07:57.990 --> 03:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
as you watch this proceed you're going
 
03:08:02.710 --> 03:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
to find that the current legislators
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
will never let this go through
 
03:08:08.150 --> 03:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the email that i sent is a an
 
03:08:10.630 --> 03:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
attachment that's got a history of term
 
03:08:12.790 --> 03:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
limit proposals
 
03:08:15.269 --> 03:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
and i'm not trying to take a position
 
03:08:17.990 --> 03:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
for or against term limits
 
03:08:19.590 --> 03:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
but i just want to
 
03:08:21.830 --> 03:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
provide the history to show
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
that in the 200 plus years there have
 
03:08:26.150 --> 03:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
been several attempts to impose term
 
03:08:29.030 --> 03:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
limits as amendments
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
those proposals never got to the states
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
for their three-quarters of people vote
 
03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
those proposals never get out of the
 
03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
committees and never get to the floor
 
03:08:41.190 --> 03:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
for consideration
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
we have a situation
 
03:08:43.040 --> 03:08:44.309 align:start position:0%
we have a situation
where

03:08:44.309 --> 03:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:08:46.389 --> 03:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
the congress are not going to propose
 
03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
amendments that are against their
 
03:08:51.510 --> 03:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
interests their self-interest
 
03:08:52.550 --> 03:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:08:55.750 --> 03:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:57.269 --> 03:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
one final thing
 
03:08:58.550 --> 03:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
03:09:00.830 --> 03:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
the convention getting out of
 
03:09:03.190 --> 03:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
control the supporters of this
 
03:09:05.349 --> 03:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
convention were believers of the
 
03:09:07.349 --> 03:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
existing constitution
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
there's no interest or ability to
 
03:09:11.510 --> 03:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate the existing one
 
03:09:13.590 --> 03:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
we're clearly not non
 
03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're clearly non-radicals we're not
 
03:09:17.910 --> 03:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
rioting we're not burning we're not
 
03:09:19.429 --> 03:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
threatening anyone
 
03:09:21.750 --> 03:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
we're working within the system we're
 
03:09:23.190 --> 03:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
following the law
 
03:09:24.950 --> 03:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
we're using the peaceful tools that were
 
03:09:28.309 --> 03:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
provided for us in article 5.
 
03:09:30.870 --> 03:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
we must use article 5 to provide the
 
03:09:33.910 --> 03:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
intended government by the people
 
03:09:35.670 --> 03:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government is only supposed
 
03:09:37.590 --> 03:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
to have those powers explicitly
 
03:09:40.309 --> 03:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
enumerated in the constitution
 
03:09:42.950 --> 03:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
all of the powers belong exclusively to
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
the states we must get those powers back
 
03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
to the states
 
03:09:50.309 --> 03:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
i respectfully request the committee
 
03:09:51.990 --> 03:09:52.000 align:start position:0%

03:09:53.830 --> 03:09:53.840 align:start position:0%

amendments under article 5 of the united
 
03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
states constitution we are at a point in
 
03:11:23.110 --> 03:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
our country's great history where the
 
03:11:25.830 --> 03:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
diligent work of our framers is being
 
03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
abused more often and in many cases
 
03:11:29.120 --> 03:11:30.550 align:start position:0%
abused more often and in many cases
lately

03:11:30.550 --> 03:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
lately
 
03:11:33.349 --> 03:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
completely ignored by the three branches
 
03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
of our government
 
03:11:37.670 --> 03:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
our government is out of control at the
 
03:11:39.910 --> 03:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
federal level our government of the
 
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
people by the people and for the people
 
03:11:45.030 --> 03:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
is in danger the federal government is a
 
03:11:47.110 --> 03:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
runaway government not a control right
 
03:11:47.120 --> 03:11:48.230 align:start position:0%
runaway government not a control right
now

03:11:48.230 --> 03:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:11:50.950 --> 03:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
the people need to act
 
03:11:53.190 --> 03:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
the federal government will not change
 
03:11:55.590 --> 03:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
until we get people down to washington
 
03:11:55.600 --> 03:11:56.630 align:start position:0%
until we get people down to washington
dc

03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
dc
 
03:11:58.710 --> 03:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
that will actually work for the people
 
03:12:02.790 --> 03:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
but that is another two years away
 
03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
as you know i am a declared candidate
 
03:12:06.150 --> 03:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
for the united states senate running
 
03:12:08.070 --> 03:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
against maggie hassan
 
03:12:10.389 --> 03:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
and i am concerned about this issue
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
because we're not going to get any help
 
03:12:14.070 --> 03:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
from that delegation
 
03:12:14.080 --> 03:12:15.269 align:start position:0%
from that delegation
um

03:12:15.269 --> 03:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:17.830 --> 03:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
my platform is consistent with balancing
 
03:12:19.830 --> 03:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
the budget fiscal responsibility
 
03:12:21.830 --> 03:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
limiting government and establishing
 
03:12:23.269 --> 03:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
term limits
 
03:12:25.269 --> 03:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
this is what this convention estates is
 
03:12:25.279 --> 03:12:26.309 align:start position:0%
this is what this convention estates is
about

03:12:26.309 --> 03:12:26.319 align:start position:0%

states is our way of doing this
 
03:12:38.230 --> 03:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
my only request is and it's respectfully
 
03:12:40.630 --> 03:12:40.640 align:start position:0%

03:12:43.510 --> 03:12:43.520 align:start position:0%

been passed in 15 states already it
 
03:17:21.349 --> 03:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
applies to congress under an article 5
 
03:17:23.269 --> 03:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
of the u.s constitution for a convention
 
03:17:24.790 --> 03:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
to propose amendments that would impose
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%

i think that we are at a time in
 
03:17:37.990 --> 03:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
american history where the federal
 
03:17:40.229 --> 03:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
government is clearly out of control and
 
03:17:41.590 --> 03:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done to restrain
 
03:17:43.750 --> 03:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
them the disagreement among at least
 
03:17:45.510 --> 03:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
those of us on the right side of the
 
03:17:47.190 --> 03:17:47.200 align:start position:0%

03:18:43.460 --> 03:18:48.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:18:48.830 --> 03:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:51.190 --> 03:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative matt agent could
 
03:19:06.070 --> 03:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:08.389 --> 03:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
welcome uh representative if you can
 
03:19:10.229 --> 03:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
like i said please speak a little louder
 
03:19:11.750 --> 03:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
because when you're back to georgia it's
 
03:19:13.750 --> 03:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
kind of hot you got some old-time
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
veterans in here that like me have
 
03:19:17.349 --> 03:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
served with artillery
 
03:19:19.110 --> 03:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know i hear him go away after a
 
03:19:19.120 --> 03:19:20.229 align:start position:0%
you know i hear him go away after a
while

03:19:20.229 --> 03:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
while
 
03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
i didn't know that you were in desert uh
 
03:19:23.830 --> 03:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
desert storm yeah
 
03:19:25.830 --> 03:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
because i was too young for vietnam but
 
03:19:25.840 --> 03:19:27.269 align:start position:0%
because i was too young for vietnam but
i

03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not like the general there you know
 
03:19:31.269 --> 03:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
i mean it went about 10 times but i i
 
03:19:33.670 --> 03:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
went once
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
all right my name is representative max
 
03:19:37.269 --> 03:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
abramson for the record i represent
 
03:19:39.429 --> 03:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
hampton hampton falls and seabrook i'm
 
03:19:41.510 --> 03:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
introducing house uh concurrent
 
03:19:43.349 --> 03:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
resolution four
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh which simply
 
03:19:48.229 --> 03:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
proposes to amend the constitution to
 
03:19:49.830 --> 03:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
declare that
 
03:19:51.190 --> 03:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
abortion is not a right under the
 
03:19:53.349 --> 03:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
constitution i'll use the exact wording
 
03:19:56.790 --> 03:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:59.269 --> 03:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
oh i lost it
 
03:20:01.030 --> 03:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
well here we go
 
03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature of the state of new
 
03:20:04.630 --> 03:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire makes this application to
 
03:20:04.640 --> 03:20:05.750 align:start position:0%
hampshire makes this application to
congress

03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
congress
 
03:20:08.309 --> 03:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
that convention be immediately called of
 
03:20:10.630 --> 03:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
deputies from the several states for the
 
03:20:12.469 --> 03:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
sole purpose of proposing an article
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
declaring that the right to abortion
 
03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
is not secured by the constitution of
 
03:20:17.830 --> 03:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
the united states
 
03:20:21.830 --> 03:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
for that provision lines 10 through 13
 
03:20:24.710 --> 03:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
i essentially copied the exact same
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
language as the very first
 
03:20:29.910 --> 03:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
applications coming from the state of
 
03:20:32.790 --> 03:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:35.110 --> 03:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
state of virginia and new york when they
 
03:20:37.349 --> 03:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
made their application that led to the
 
03:20:39.429 --> 03:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
enactment of the bill of rights
 
03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
i will make a disclaimer on this one
 
03:20:43.830 --> 03:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
unlike hcr1
 
03:20:45.590 --> 03:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility outside
 
03:20:48.710 --> 03:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
possibility that hcr4
 
03:20:51.349 --> 03:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
congress may not want to
 
03:20:53.110 --> 03:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
draft the language themselves and they
 
03:20:54.550 --> 03:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
could call a convention of the states
 
03:20:55.510 --> 03:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
now i would
 
03:20:55.520 --> 03:20:56.790 align:start position:0%
now i would
prefer

03:20:56.790 --> 03:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
03:20:58.870 --> 03:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
as it i would prefer as it says that we
 
03:21:00.550 --> 03:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
do a convention of the states on this
 
03:21:00.560 --> 03:21:01.510 align:start position:0%
do a convention of the states on this
one

03:21:01.510 --> 03:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:21:01.520 --> 03:21:02.630 align:start position:0%
one
and

03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh the reason is
 
03:21:07.030 --> 03:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
um that we have
 
03:21:08.790 --> 03:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
generally majorities in the house and
 
03:21:12.150 --> 03:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
senate that are not as amenable to this
 
03:21:14.870 --> 03:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
um but the the effect of the amendment
 
03:21:16.389 --> 03:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
would be if it passed
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
is that it would
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
essentially nullify roe v wade which is
 
03:21:22.870 --> 03:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
actually no longer the law of the land
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
but it would also nullify
 
03:21:26.790 --> 03:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh another decision
 
03:21:29.110 --> 03:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh casey versus planned parenthood which
 
03:21:33.510 --> 03:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
i think is a 1992 decision
 
03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
which superseded roe v wade
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
roe v wade is used as the
 
03:21:42.630 --> 03:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh example when people bring up judicial
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
activism the most common case that's
 
03:21:46.309 --> 03:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
03:21:49.590 --> 03:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
is roe v wade and the reason is
 
03:21:51.510 --> 03:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
that this had been a states rights issue
 
03:21:55.349 --> 03:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
of course this is new england we have
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
lots of small geographically small
 
03:22:01.269 --> 03:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
states bunched together so the effect
 
03:22:03.910 --> 03:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
has always been with small states
 
03:22:05.670 --> 03:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
that you'll have some states banning
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
abortion at 24 weeks
 
03:22:10.150 --> 03:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
some states are banned at 18 weeks some
 
03:22:13.110 --> 03:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
states have have tried to ban it at
 
03:22:15.030 --> 03:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know the second trimester
 
03:22:16.550 --> 03:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
effectively that means that someone in
 
03:22:18.309 --> 03:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
the second trimester only has to drive
 
03:22:20.550 --> 03:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
across state lines but it is kind of a
 
03:22:23.510 --> 03:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
matter of principle that
 
03:22:24.870 --> 03:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
that this has always been a 10th
 
03:22:26.790 --> 03:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
amendment issue
 
03:22:28.870 --> 03:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
that the states had the right to enact
 
03:22:31.349 --> 03:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
laws relating to informed parental
 
03:22:34.630 --> 03:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
consent exceptions for rape incest
 
03:22:35.990 --> 03:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
health of the mother
 
03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:37.030 align:start position:0%
health of the mother
and

03:22:37.030 --> 03:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:39.510 --> 03:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with other cases voters had the
 
03:22:41.349 --> 03:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
right to address these issues of
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
principle through their state
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
legislature not through the u.s supreme
 
03:22:44.720 --> 03:22:46.229 align:start position:0%
legislature not through the u.s supreme
court

03:22:46.229 --> 03:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:22:46.239 --> 03:22:47.349 align:start position:0%
court
and

03:22:47.349 --> 03:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:50.790 --> 03:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
the um oh there is a typo in the in the
 
03:22:52.950 --> 03:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
um not a typo but
 
03:22:55.990 --> 03:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh state of rhode island there i believe
 
03:22:57.990 --> 03:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
14 or 15 states
 
03:22:59.910 --> 03:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
that have approved this already someone
 
03:23:01.670 --> 03:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
sent me an email
 
03:23:03.349 --> 03:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
from cornerstone which does support a
 
03:23:05.590 --> 03:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
convention in order to repeal roe v wade
 
03:23:07.110 --> 03:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
03:23:09.510 --> 03:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's a statement that they've had
 
03:23:12.309 --> 03:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
public for a long time
 
03:23:12.319 --> 03:23:13.190 align:start position:0%
public for a long time
they

03:23:13.190 --> 03:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't find an application from the
 
03:23:17.190 --> 03:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
state of rhode island so if members want
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
to delete that one
 
03:23:21.269 --> 03:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
until we can actually find that
 
03:23:21.279 --> 03:23:22.469 align:start position:0%
until we can actually find that
application

03:23:22.469 --> 03:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:23:24.309 --> 03:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
applications there are 600 applications
 
03:23:25.830 --> 03:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
from state legislatures they're actually
 
03:23:29.750 --> 03:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:31.910 --> 03:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
of about 600 i've read almost 100 of
 
03:23:33.750 --> 03:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
these applications
 
03:23:36.950 --> 03:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
from state legislatures over the years
 
03:23:36.960 --> 03:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
from state legislatures over the years
um

03:23:37.380 --> 03:23:37.390 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:37.390 --> 03:23:40.389 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

03:23:40.389 --> 03:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:23:44.150 --> 03:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
essentially all i'm trying to do is
 
03:23:46.630 --> 03:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
declare that as legislators
 
03:23:48.309 --> 03:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
we're not going to stand by and allow
 
03:23:51.750 --> 03:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
judicial activism and allow
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
judges or justices to simply
 
03:23:56.550 --> 03:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
read things into the constitution that
 
03:23:58.870 --> 03:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
the founding fathers would never
 
03:24:00.309 --> 03:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
have intended
 
03:24:03.030 --> 03:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
um there's absolutely no history or
 
03:24:05.990 --> 03:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional law or anything of any
 
03:24:07.750 --> 03:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
kind going back
 
03:24:09.910 --> 03:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know to 1789 where the founding
 
03:24:11.590 --> 03:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
fathers ever
 
03:24:13.269 --> 03:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
or any constitutional scholar ever
 
03:24:14.309 --> 03:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
thought that
 
03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
that right to an abortion was something
 
03:24:17.910 --> 03:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
under under federal law or under the
 
03:24:19.910 --> 03:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
constitution it was has always been a
 
03:24:21.750 --> 03:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
states rights issue
 
03:24:24.150 --> 03:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully more states will
 
03:24:26.950 --> 03:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
take this on and submit this application
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
unless we
 
03:24:30.309 --> 03:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
add our state to the name and get the
 
03:24:33.110 --> 03:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
ball rolling again uh i i don't think
 
03:24:34.469 --> 03:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:24:37.750 --> 03:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
these cases will be overturned
 
03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll take questions okay
 
03:24:41.429 --> 03:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:24:45.960 --> 03:24:45.970 align:start position:0%

member of the public
 
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
i want to thank representative abramson
 
03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
for introducing this resolution uh you
 
03:26:55.990 --> 03:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
know our declaration of independence
 
03:26:57.510 --> 03:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
states that we hold these truths to be
 
03:26:59.670 --> 03:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
self-evident that all men are created
 
03:27:01.110 --> 03:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
equal that they are endowed by the
 
03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
creator with certain unalienable rights
 
03:27:05.429 --> 03:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
that among these are life liberty and
 
03:27:07.349 --> 03:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
the pursuit of happiness unquote
 
03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
jefferson when he wrote that he didn't
 
03:27:10.229 --> 03:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
say that all men are born equal they're
 
03:27:13.190 --> 03:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
all created equal and hcr4 seeks to
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
protect the most basic
 
03:27:17.190 --> 03:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
right known to mankind which is the the
 
03:27:19.990 --> 03:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
right to life which begins at conception
 
03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:21.030 align:start position:0%
right to life which begins at conception
um

03:27:21.030 --> 03:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:24.630 --> 03:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
far for for i'm sorry for far too long
 
03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
the state legislatures have allowed our
 
03:27:28.389 --> 03:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
constitution to be amended by usurpation
 
03:27:29.910 --> 03:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
instead of by the provision under
 
03:27:31.349 --> 03:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
article 5.
 
03:27:34.150 --> 03:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has had judicial
 
03:27:37.830 --> 03:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
decisions made judicial activism
 
03:27:40.389 --> 03:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
decisions made which i would say roe v
 
03:27:42.790 --> 03:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
wade is probably one of the the most
 
03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:44.309 align:start position:0%
wade is probably one of the the most
um

03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:46.309 --> 03:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
or the worst
 
03:27:49.030 --> 03:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
what's so important here is that
 
03:27:51.269 --> 03:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
in our amendment history four of our
 
03:27:54.870 --> 03:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
amendments were proposed to overturn
 
03:27:57.429 --> 03:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
decisions of the us supreme court
 
03:28:00.630 --> 03:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
and that is the power of article five
 
03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
the problem we have today is we're
 
03:28:04.630 --> 03:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
letting the courts make the laws we have
 
03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
presidents who are changing our laws
 
03:28:09.990 --> 03:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
through executive orders i saw today the
 
03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
president has issued 37 executive orders
 
03:28:13.910 --> 03:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
so far
 
03:28:13.920 --> 03:28:15.110 align:start position:0%
so far
violating

03:28:15.110 --> 03:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
violating
 
03:28:17.510 --> 03:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
and this is all the presidents obama
 
03:28:19.429 --> 03:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
trump you name them they're violating
 
03:28:21.670 --> 03:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
their oath of office and congress has
 
03:28:23.990 --> 03:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
refused to do anything about this they
 
03:28:25.990 --> 03:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
are expanding their powers abdicating
 
03:28:27.190 --> 03:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
their legislative authority to
 
03:28:30.630 --> 03:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies and it's only the states
 
03:28:32.550 --> 03:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
that are sitting back and and letting
 
03:28:34.950 --> 03:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
this happen when they have the duty and
 
03:28:37.670 --> 03:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to push back and
 
03:28:40.070 --> 03:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
change this on our behalf and so
 
03:28:42.229 --> 03:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately if we don't take action
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
through article 5 i do not see things
 
03:28:48.309 --> 03:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
getting any better the the federalist 85
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
hamilton expressly
 
03:28:52.710 --> 03:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
explains that article 5 is the ultimate
 
03:28:54.950 --> 03:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
check against the encroachments of the
 
03:28:57.269 --> 03:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
federal government and he says this
 
03:28:59.830 --> 03:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
we may safely rely on the disposition of
 
03:29:02.309 --> 03:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
the state legislatures to erect barriers
 
03:29:04.150 --> 03:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
against the encroachments of the
 
03:29:06.389 --> 03:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
national authority that was the purpose
 
03:29:08.710 --> 03:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
they put the article 5 convention into
 
03:29:10.389 --> 03:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
our constitution
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
and we are seeing encroachment on a
 
03:29:15.429 --> 03:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
daily basis in closing i would just like
 
03:29:17.269 --> 03:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
to share with you that congress has
 
03:29:19.990 --> 03:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
introduced over 12 000 amendments to the
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
u.s constitution since 1789
 
03:29:25.670 --> 03:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
while the states have introduced zero
 
03:29:27.990 --> 03:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
amendments under article five
 
03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:28.950 align:start position:0%
amendments under article five
now

03:29:28.950 --> 03:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:29:30.469 --> 03:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of these amendments that congress
 
03:29:32.309 --> 03:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
has have introduced are phenomenal
 
03:29:34.150 --> 03:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
amendments but they will never see the
 
03:29:35.990 --> 03:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
light of day because we can never get
 
03:29:38.950 --> 03:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
enough members we need a two-thirds uh
 
03:29:40.710 --> 03:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
to pass this in both the house and the
 
03:29:42.790 --> 03:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
senate and they will not do that because
 
03:29:45.190 --> 03:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
they want to maintain the status quo and
 
03:29:48.229 --> 03:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
protect the establishment and so
 
03:29:50.150 --> 03:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
what's important about this particular
 
03:29:52.389 --> 03:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
resolution is that the states tried to
 
03:29:55.429 --> 03:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
overturn this in the late 70s 19 state
 
03:29:58.070 --> 03:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
legislatures applied for a convention
 
03:30:00.150 --> 03:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
for a right to life amendment and it was
 
03:30:02.710 --> 03:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
because of the efforts of
 
03:30:04.389 --> 03:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
conspiracy groups like the john birch
 
03:30:06.550 --> 03:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
society eagle forum which was led by
 
03:30:09.510 --> 03:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
phyllis schlafly and the league of women
 
03:30:11.269 --> 03:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
voters these groups
 
03:30:13.349 --> 03:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the aisle
 
03:30:15.990 --> 03:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
use the fear of a runaway convention by
 
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
getting people to doubt that we wouldn't
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
know how the rules would work that it
 
03:30:21.670 --> 03:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
was a constitutional convention we
 
03:30:24.229 --> 03:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't control it and so that fear
 
03:30:26.469 --> 03:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
derailed the effort by the state
 
03:30:29.110 --> 03:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
legislatures to get to a convention to
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
overturn roe v wade and so what i am
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
imploring you to do today
 
03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
is that we need to
 
03:30:39.110 --> 03:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
have fearless leaders that are are not
 
03:30:41.030 --> 03:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
fearful of not knowing what the rules
 
03:30:42.229 --> 03:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
are because as i mentioned in my
 
03:30:44.309 --> 03:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
previous testimony we have the rules we
 
03:30:46.389 --> 03:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
just need to use the rules that have
 
03:30:48.229 --> 03:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
been provided to us
 
03:30:51.190 --> 03:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
under article 5 to use the authority
 
03:30:53.910 --> 03:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
that you the state legislators have
 
03:30:56.870 --> 03:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
to push back against the overreach
 
03:30:58.950 --> 03:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
of the federal government the judicial
 
03:31:01.510 --> 03:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
activism of our courts
 
03:31:03.510 --> 03:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
and the executive powers that we're
 
03:31:05.590 --> 03:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
seeing being
 
03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
abused by our presidents and so i leave
 
03:31:09.910 --> 03:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
that up to you and i encourage you to
 
03:31:11.190 --> 03:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
please support
 
03:31:14.389 --> 03:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
and pass hcr 4. thank you
 
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
03:31:22.070 --> 03:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:38.710 --> 03:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:38.720 --> 03:31:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:31:44.070 --> 03:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman thank you uh
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
my name is jeannie herresca i'm from
 
03:31:50.469 --> 03:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
concord new hampshire i'm the political
 
03:31:51.830 --> 03:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
director for the american civil
 
03:31:54.469 --> 03:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
liberties union of new hampshire and i
 
03:31:56.309 --> 03:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
03:31:59.670 --> 03:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to hcr 4
 
03:32:01.190 --> 03:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
and in opposition to calling for a
 
03:32:04.150 --> 03:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention on any subject
 
03:32:04.160 --> 03:32:05.429 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention on any subject
matter

03:32:05.429 --> 03:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
matter
 
03:32:07.190 --> 03:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
there is no language in the u.s
 
03:32:09.910 --> 03:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
constitution that allows a convention to
 
03:32:12.389 --> 03:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
be limited to just one issue
 
03:32:14.790 --> 03:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
if a convention is called
 
03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
it could be used to consider whatever
 
03:32:19.670 --> 03:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
happens to the constitution delegates
 
03:32:19.680 --> 03:32:20.870 align:start position:0%
happens to the constitution delegates
choose

03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
choose
 
03:32:20.880 --> 03:32:26.150 align:start position:0%
choose
so

03:32:26.150 --> 03:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:29.190 --> 03:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
other entirely unrelated issues um
 
03:32:31.269 --> 03:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
posing a dangerous threat to the u.s
 
03:32:33.990 --> 03:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
constitution to our democracy
 
03:32:37.670 --> 03:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
and to our civil rights quite simply
 
03:32:39.910 --> 03:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
there are no guidelines or rules that
 
03:32:42.630 --> 03:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
will govern a convention we have no
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
direct precedent it's unclear how
 
03:32:47.190 --> 03:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
convention delegates would be picked
 
03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
what rules would be in place what would
 
03:32:51.670 --> 03:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
happen in the case of legal disputes or
 
03:32:53.510 --> 03:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
how the american people and specifically
 
03:32:56.630 --> 03:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
granite staters would be represented
 
03:32:56.640 --> 03:32:57.750 align:start position:0%
granite staters would be represented
so

03:32:57.750 --> 03:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:58.950 --> 03:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
in our view
 
03:33:01.269 --> 03:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of your position on abortion
 
03:33:03.670 --> 03:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
specifically the proposal for a
 
03:33:05.910 --> 03:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention should be
 
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
concerning it's dangerous to convene a
 
03:33:10.150 --> 03:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
convention about changing our
 
03:33:12.469 --> 03:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
constitution when that convention would
 
03:33:15.750 --> 03:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
have such few guard rails and it is for
 
03:33:17.830 --> 03:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
these reasons that the aclu of new
 
03:33:19.830 --> 03:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire respectfully asks this
 
03:33:23.190 --> 03:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
committee to vote hcr4 and expedient to
 
03:33:23.200 --> 03:33:25.750 align:start position:0%
committee to vote hcr4 and expedient to
legislate

03:33:25.750 --> 03:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:35.990 --> 03:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:37.510 --> 03:33:37.520 align:start position:0%

03:34:41.910 --> 03:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
more than what i see in my clinic
 
03:34:41.920 --> 03:34:42.710 align:start position:0%
more than what i see in my clinic
i

03:34:42.710 --> 03:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:34:44.309 --> 03:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
work with a passionate group of
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
physicians who are there for women's
 
03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
rights and women's rights to choose
 
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
what they do with their body and how
 
03:34:51.670 --> 03:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
they decide to do that
 
03:34:53.830 --> 03:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
we see so many stories of patients
 
03:34:54.870 --> 03:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
03:34:56.790 --> 03:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
truly excited about the possibility of
 
03:34:59.190 --> 03:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
motherhood and truly excited together
 
03:35:01.349 --> 03:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
for their choice to proceed but things
 
03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
happen outside of their control things
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
that devastate families things that
 
03:35:07.910 --> 03:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
devastate their dreams their hopes
 
03:35:09.990 --> 03:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
and have been in many situations where
 
03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
i've had to hold the hands of patients
 
03:35:14.309 --> 03:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
who have just been broken by
 
03:35:16.309 --> 03:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
diagnoses that they had no control over
 
03:35:18.469 --> 03:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
diagnoses that won't allow
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
um a appropriate life or a life outside
 
03:35:22.469 --> 03:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
of the womb
 
03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
and these decisions are not made lightly
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
they're not made because the woman
 
03:35:28.229 --> 03:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
really um
 
03:35:30.309 --> 03:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
you know has an option in terms of what
 
03:35:32.229 --> 03:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
she decides to do um she does it out of
 
03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
true love for her
 
03:35:37.030 --> 03:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
or baby and i think you know when that
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
is what's that question or what's at
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
stake here when you're bringing up
 
03:35:43.510 --> 03:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
the right to choose and deciding that
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
there is no right there i think that is
 
03:35:47.429 --> 03:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
a true
 
03:35:47.439 --> 03:35:48.309 align:start position:0%
a true
um

03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
a true setback for women that we see
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
every single day regular women who just
 
03:35:54.309 --> 03:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
really want to have the best for their
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
lives and for their babies lives so
 
03:35:58.389 --> 03:35:58.399 align:start position:0%
i would humbly request that you
 
03:35:58.399 --> 03:35:59.830 align:start position:0%
i would humbly request that you
reconsider

03:35:59.830 --> 03:35:59.840 align:start position:0%

as a result of my ethnic origin i have
 
04:02:07.990 --> 04:02:08.000 align:start position:0%

04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
and have kept abreast of the progress
 
04:02:17.760 --> 04:02:18.469 align:start position:0%
and have kept abreast of the progress
that

04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:02:20.950 --> 04:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
was being made in democratic values and
 
04:02:24.150 --> 04:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
governances in those countries
 
04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
also i have worked as a caseworker for
 
04:02:28.550 --> 04:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
amnesty international
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
on behalf of prisoners of conscience in
 
04:02:30.720 --> 04:02:31.830 align:start position:0%

russia
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
and taiwan while it was still a military
 
04:02:34.479 --> 04:02:35.990 align:start position:0%
and taiwan while it was still a military
dictatorship

04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
dictatorship
 
04:02:37.750 --> 04:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
and i found
 
04:02:40.070 --> 04:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
a great deal of satisfaction to see that
 
04:02:42.070 --> 04:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
some of these countries were able to
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
throw off a dictatorship or a one-party
 
04:02:48.309 --> 04:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
rule and and have democratically elected
 
04:02:48.319 --> 04:02:50.550 align:start position:0%
rule and and have democratically elected
governments

04:02:50.550 --> 04:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
governments
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
that is why for me personally seeing
 
04:02:54.550 --> 04:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
that the hungarian government currently
 
04:02:57.269 --> 04:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
is reversing course and heading back to
 
04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
a more authoritarian rule by one party
 
04:03:02.950 --> 04:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
has been quite disappointing
 
04:03:05.830 --> 04:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
i realize that this resolution today is
 
04:03:09.670 --> 04:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
only as symbolic and symbolic in nature
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
since we are not in charge of our

however i don't i don't think that that
 
04:03:18.309 --> 04:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
means that we cannot
 
04:03:20.550 --> 04:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
that we can't express our sentiments
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%

04:03:26.710 --> 04:03:26.720 align:start position:0%

presenting this uh hcr first a quick
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
question i know that we always refer to
 
04:04:12.790 --> 04:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
democracy democracy democracy is there
 
04:04:12.800 --> 04:04:13.910 align:start position:0%
democracy democracy democracy is there
any

04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
what's happened to
 
04:04:17.429 --> 04:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
a republican form of government is that
 
04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
something that
 
04:04:22.389 --> 04:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
no longer looking at to promote or is it
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:28.790 --> 04:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh representative for your
 
04:04:30.950 --> 04:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
04:04:33.510 --> 04:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
i'm using the term democracy here or
 
04:04:36.630 --> 04:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
democratic in a generic terminology
 
04:04:39.750 --> 04:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh the way i interpret it is basically
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
allowing people to elect whatever form
 
04:04:44.150 --> 04:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
of government they wish to have
 
04:04:45.910 --> 04:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
so it's not a particular form of
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
government in fact you probably know
 
04:04:49.990 --> 04:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
that most european countries
 
04:04:52.630 --> 04:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
have a parliamentary democracy which
 
04:04:52.640 --> 04:04:53.510 align:start position:0%
have a parliamentary democracy which
means

04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
means
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh they elect the parliament and the
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
majority of the public the parliament
 
04:04:59.590 --> 04:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
then elects their government so it's not
 
04:05:01.750 --> 04:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
like our government here where we select
 
04:05:03.670 --> 04:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
our president separate from the
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
representatives in congress so i'm using
 
04:05:08.950 --> 04:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
the term democracy and democratic in a
 
04:05:11.590 --> 04:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
generic term meaning people should be
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to elect the kind of government
 
04:05:17.189 --> 04:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
that they want to represent them
 
04:05:20.469 --> 04:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for that answer um
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
seeing that there's no other
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions or any
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%

04:05:27.279 --> 04:05:28.389 align:start position:0%

issues going on in poland and i about

04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
timely manner because he's built
 
04:06:52.950 --> 04:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
like china russia and iran and north
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
korea who oppress their people and
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
promote other regimes and groups that
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
are equally growing when we see this
 
04:07:00.880 --> 04:07:01.830 align:start position:0%
are equally growing when we see this
growing

04:07:01.830 --> 04:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
growing
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%

04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional monarchies
 
04:07:08.950 --> 04:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
across um
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
specifically china actually cycled the
 
04:07:13.750 --> 04:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
previously listed uh you know ideals of
 
04:07:16.710 --> 04:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
democracy and freedom and equality in
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
places like hong kong
 
04:07:34.790 --> 04:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.790 --> 04:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
of their own peoples we should express
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
our concerns as a comedian of the
 
04:07:41.429 --> 04:07:41.439 align:start position:0%
legislature to ensure that we speak up
 
04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
for those who do not practice such
 
04:07:45.189 --> 04:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
freedoms in their own countries
 
04:07:47.830 --> 04:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
democratic principles leads happier and
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%

have a voice in their government to have
 
04:07:57.030 --> 04:07:57.040 align:start position:0%

04:40:56.628 --> 04:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:56.638 --> 04:40:59.670 align:start position:0%
 
group

04:40:59.670 --> 04:40:59.680 align:start position:0%

04:41:47.030 --> 04:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:49.830 --> 04:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay i'm uh representative max abramson
 
04:41:51.670 --> 04:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh representing the good folks in
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
hampton hampton falls and seabrook
 
04:41:58.708 --> 04:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
i'm introducing house resolution 7
 
04:42:01.030 --> 04:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:42:03.830 --> 04:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
calling for the netflix movie cuties to
 
04:42:07.030 --> 04:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
and also asking the department of
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
justice to investigate
 
04:42:12.150 --> 04:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
i assume that means having one of their
 
04:42:13.830 --> 04:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
paralegals or somebody actually having
 
04:42:15.910 --> 04:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
to watch the movie um
 
04:42:17.190 --> 04:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
i understand that
 
04:42:19.030 --> 04:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
rotten tomatoes has given the movie a
 
04:42:20.550 --> 04:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
score of something like three percent
 
04:42:21.990 --> 04:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
that only three percent of people like
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
the movie and none of those people will
 
04:42:26.070 --> 04:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
admit to enjoying the film
 
04:42:26.080 --> 04:42:29.110 align:start position:0%
admit to enjoying the film
uh

04:42:29.110 --> 04:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
i was contacted by many many many people
 
04:42:33.670 --> 04:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
who are upset about this film
 
04:42:34.830 --> 04:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
and as soon as
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
i posted this on social media
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
um i wanted i had the idea of posting an
 
04:42:43.270 --> 04:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
image so people know what film it was
 
04:42:45.990 --> 04:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
but i couldn't find any image other than
 
04:42:47.510 --> 04:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
just the poster for the movie and even
 
04:42:48.830 --> 04:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
that was kind of
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
provocative um
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment that would just say
 
04:42:57.030 --> 04:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
um change it to just condemning the film
 
04:42:58.230 --> 04:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
cuties i
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
i don't agree with the
 
04:43:00.320 --> 04:43:02.390 align:start position:0%
i don't agree with the
amendment

04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:43:05.270 --> 04:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
and the the reason is i think that it's
 
04:43:07.750 --> 04:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's pretty
 
04:43:07.760 --> 04:43:08.868 align:start position:0%
it's pretty
obvious

04:43:08.868 --> 04:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
obvious
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
that the movie contains so much illegal
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
good graveyard here it is
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
the movie contains so much material that
 
04:43:20.708 --> 04:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
violates 18 usc 2251 and 252
 
04:43:22.708 --> 04:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
and i i would argue that it that it
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
isn't even really arguable
 
04:43:25.360 --> 04:43:26.708 align:start position:0%
isn't even really arguable
um

04:43:26.708 --> 04:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:29.030 --> 04:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
that it's that there were
 
04:43:30.788 --> 04:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
apparently so many different laws broken
 
04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
in the the making of this film
 
04:43:33.760 --> 04:43:34.868 align:start position:0%
in the the making of this film
that

04:43:34.868 --> 04:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:34.878 --> 04:43:36.550 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:43:36.550 --> 04:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's almost like it doesn't even need to
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
go to trial the problem that i saw from
 
04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
reviewers and people on social media is
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
they wanted to take
 
04:43:45.510 --> 04:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
snippets of the film
 
04:43:45.520 --> 04:43:46.868 align:start position:0%
snippets of the film
and

04:43:46.868 --> 04:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:48.550 --> 04:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
share it just to make the point and the
 
04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
reviewers kept saying the same thing i
 
04:43:51.750 --> 04:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
think i saw
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 reviews they all said the same
 
04:43:55.590 --> 04:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
thing i can't even show some of the
 
04:43:57.190 --> 04:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
material on this film because it would
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
be illegal for me to share it and then i
 
04:43:59.760 --> 04:44:00.708 align:start position:0%
be illegal for me to share it and then i
thought

04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
thought
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
well wait i you know my constituents
 
04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
can't share images from this film
 
04:44:05.830 --> 04:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
because it's so
 
04:44:09.670 --> 04:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
sexually explicit and uh um
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
in its depiction of these 11 and 12 year
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
old girls
 
04:44:16.390 --> 04:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
so if you can't share the stuff on
 
04:44:17.910 --> 04:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
social media you can't share it on
 
04:44:19.590 --> 04:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
youtube you can't share it on vimeo you
 
04:44:21.190 --> 04:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
can't share it on any of the video
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
hosting sites
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
if you can't do that as a private
 
04:44:26.550 --> 04:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
citizen how come netflix can
 
04:44:28.150 --> 04:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
it would be illegal for you to share the
 
04:44:30.470 --> 04:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
material um it's a movie that was made
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
in france and i understand that the
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
europeans have very different standards
 
04:44:35.830 --> 04:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
um and are are
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
quite willing to push the limits of of
 
04:44:41.990 --> 04:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
what you can show um
 
04:44:43.510 --> 04:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
04:44:45.270 --> 04:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
a number of attorneys looked at this
 
04:44:47.670 --> 04:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
this film um some of them watched the
 
04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
entire thing a number of reviewers said
 
04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
that they couldn't finish watching the
 
04:44:52.310 --> 04:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
film they watched about 20 or 30 minutes
 
04:44:55.350 --> 04:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
of it they said this is this is gastly
 
04:44:57.510 --> 04:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick summary of some of the
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
things shown in there um
 
04:45:01.910 --> 04:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
underage girl exposes her breast in a
 
04:45:03.990 --> 04:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
sexually explicit manner
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
um 11 and 12 year old girls twerking
 
04:45:06.240 --> 04:45:07.830 align:start position:0%

twerking videos
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh one of the producers i guess was
 
04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
convicted already before making the
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
movie of some
 
04:45:22.070 --> 04:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
type of sex offense and he was still
 
04:45:23.910 --> 04:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate making the movie
 
04:45:26.550 --> 04:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
and it was sex offense against children

04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
i won't go into that one
 
04:45:35.830 --> 04:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
one scene which i did not see
 
04:45:40.708 --> 04:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
is described as mimicking hardcore
 
04:45:40.718 --> 04:45:42.550 align:start position:0%
is described as mimicking hardcore
pornography

04:45:42.550 --> 04:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
pornography
 
04:45:45.110 --> 04:45:45.120 align:start position:0%

girls are sexually twerking to escape
 
04:45:51.270 --> 04:45:51.280 align:start position:0%

04:45:53.910 --> 04:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
movie makes it obvious that the guy is
 
04:45:55.990 --> 04:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
some type of pedophile
 
04:45:56.000 --> 04:45:57.590 align:start position:0%
some type of pedophile

um
 
04:45:59.190 --> 04:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
for people who measure the time seven
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
and a half minutes of close-ups of the
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
crotch but in breast areas of these
 
04:46:03.040 --> 04:46:04.230 align:start position:0%
crotch but in breast areas of these
girls

04:46:04.230 --> 04:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
girls
 
04:46:05.910 --> 04:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
there's one extreme zoom in after
 
04:46:07.510 --> 04:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
another and not just that they zoom in
 
04:46:09.750 --> 04:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
but that they stay zoomed in
 
04:46:09.760 --> 04:46:11.990 align:start position:0%
but that they stay zoomed in
um

04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:14.310 --> 04:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh imdb put this in
 
04:46:16.708 --> 04:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
the category sex and nudity
 
04:46:16.718 --> 04:46:18.230 align:start position:0%
the category sex and nudity
and

04:46:18.230 --> 04:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:18.240 --> 04:46:20.070 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:46:20.070 --> 04:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
oh disclaimer right after i submitted
 
04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
this i didn't do some background
 
04:46:24.788 --> 04:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
research on netflix
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
um through open secrets and they did
 
04:46:28.470 --> 04:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
give six and a half million dollars to
 
04:46:30.550 --> 04:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
democrat campaigns last cycle if that
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
matters to anyone hope it doesn't
 
04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
but right after i put this in
 
04:46:36.160 --> 04:46:37.190 align:start position:0%
but right after i put this in
on

04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
23rd of september 2020 netflix was
 
04:46:42.628 --> 04:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
indicted by a grand jury in tyler county
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
texas on a charge that it quote depicts
 
04:46:47.430 --> 04:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
the ludix exhibition of the genitals or
 
04:46:49.350 --> 04:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
pubic area of a clothed or partially
 
04:46:51.270 --> 04:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
clothed child who was younger than 18
 
04:46:53.110 --> 04:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
years of age
 
04:46:53.120 --> 04:46:53.990 align:start position:0%
years of age
so

04:46:53.990 --> 04:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
this is one of those cases where
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
exhibition of this movie
 
04:46:59.670 --> 04:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
probably violates state law it certainly
 
04:47:03.750 --> 04:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:03.760 --> 04:47:04.948 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:47:04.948 --> 04:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:04.958 --> 04:47:05.990 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:47:05.990 --> 04:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:06.000 --> 04:47:08.788 align:start position:0%
um
it's

04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know court court presidents
 
04:47:13.270 --> 04:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
change the law change the way we
 
04:47:14.868 --> 04:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
interpret the law change the way we see
 
04:47:16.550 --> 04:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
the law they're based on crimes that are
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
actually committed and i think the new
 
04:47:18.718 --> 04:47:19.830 align:start position:0%
actually committed and i think the new
area

04:47:19.830 --> 04:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:47:19.840 --> 04:47:20.948 align:start position:0%
area
um

04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:22.868 --> 04:47:22.878 align:start position:0%
on obscenity law
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
that would come out of this case if this
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
were actually prosecuted by the
 
04:47:27.750 --> 04:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
04:47:29.910 --> 04:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
is is this question which is what all
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
the reviewers kept asking
 
04:47:34.070 --> 04:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
was this scene really necessary was this
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
shot really necessary did they really
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
need seven and a half minutes of
 
04:47:40.470 --> 04:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
close-ups on their shorts areas
 
04:47:40.480 --> 04:47:41.430 align:start position:0%
close-ups on their shorts areas
um

04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
every reviewer is asking that same but
 
04:47:44.788 --> 04:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
almost every reviewer's asked the same
 
04:47:46.230 --> 04:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
question and people are asking me do
 
04:47:48.150 --> 04:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
they really need to show this image and
 
04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
that image and this scene
 
04:47:51.350 --> 04:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
partial nudity by underage girls over
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
and over again
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
i understand the point that the film is
 
04:48:00.070 --> 04:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
trying to make
 
04:48:02.788 --> 04:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
um i agree that
 
04:48:04.708 --> 04:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
conservative parents
 
04:48:04.718 --> 04:48:05.430 align:start position:0%
conservative parents
are

04:48:05.430 --> 04:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:48:07.270 --> 04:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
certainly having a difficult time in
 
04:48:08.948 --> 04:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
today's society
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
trying to instill values into their kids
 
04:48:13.350 --> 04:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
when their kids are being constantly
 
04:48:16.150 --> 04:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
bombarded with sexualized image imagery
 
04:48:18.868 --> 04:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
i understand that message
 
04:48:20.948 --> 04:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
and i actually agree with that message
 
04:48:20.958 --> 04:48:22.390 align:start position:0%
and i actually agree with that message
however

04:48:22.390 --> 04:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:48:22.400 --> 04:48:23.350 align:start position:0%
however
there

04:48:23.350 --> 04:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:48:25.270 --> 04:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
the film itself
 
04:48:26.470 --> 04:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
is so
 
04:48:26.480 --> 04:48:27.260 align:start position:0%
is so
brazenly

04:48:27.260 --> 04:48:27.270 align:start position:0%
brazenly
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:28.708 align:start position:0%
brazenly
[Music]

04:48:28.708 --> 04:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:48:32.310 --> 04:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
and so clearly illegal it is so
 
04:48:35.110 --> 04:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
it it's so openly and repeatedly
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
violates the spirit
 
04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
of the law
 
04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
you know they could have edited the film
 
04:48:44.708 --> 04:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
they could have cut out most of the
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
scenes or bettered it yet not shot most
 
04:48:48.550 --> 04:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
of those scenes shooting the scenes
 
04:48:49.910 --> 04:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
themselves would be illegal if it were
 
04:48:51.510 --> 04:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
done in the united states
 
04:48:51.520 --> 04:48:52.830 align:start position:0%
done in the united states
um

04:48:52.830 --> 04:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:55.830 --> 04:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
and they could have used 18 year old
 
04:48:57.910 --> 04:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
actresses they could have pointed the
 
04:49:00.628 --> 04:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
camera at the ground they could have
 
04:49:03.110 --> 04:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
implied a number of things everyone just
 
04:49:05.350 --> 04:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
kept calling this movie pedobate or that
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's that it's marketed to people who
 
04:49:09.270 --> 04:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
want to see
 
04:49:11.590 --> 04:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
sexualized images of 11 and 12 year old
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
girls i think that it's
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's certainly inappropriate a handful
 
04:49:17.670 --> 04:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
of people on social media said well it's
 
04:49:19.190 --> 04:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
a free speech issue
 
04:49:19.200 --> 04:49:20.390 align:start position:0%
a free speech issue
but

04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:49:23.030 --> 04:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be a free speech issue if we
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
had someone
 
04:49:26.550 --> 04:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
else who'd already been a convicted sex
 
04:49:26.560 --> 04:49:27.590 align:start position:0%
else who'd already been a convicted sex
offender

04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
offender
 
04:49:30.070 --> 04:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
making yet another video like this
 
04:49:31.990 --> 04:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
just let's say for his own entertainment
 
04:49:32.000 --> 04:49:32.708 align:start position:0%
just let's say for his own entertainment
or

04:49:32.708 --> 04:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:49:35.430 --> 04:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
to abuse kids to just take a movie like
 
04:49:35.440 --> 04:49:36.550 align:start position:0%
to abuse kids to just take a movie like
that

04:49:36.550 --> 04:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
and then add on
 
04:49:41.030 --> 04:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
that they're putting it out in front of
 
04:49:42.948 --> 04:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of viewers there
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
are several online petitions that have
 
04:49:46.070 --> 04:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
gathered i think two to three million
 
04:49:48.550 --> 04:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
signatures there's a
 
04:49:51.510 --> 04:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
really big boycott of netflix they saw a
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
dramatic drop off in their their
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
membership there's a lot of people angry
 
04:49:57.510 --> 04:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
and i put this up as a kind of informal
 
04:49:57.520 --> 04:49:58.310 align:start position:0%
and i put this up as a kind of informal
hole

04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
hole
 
04:50:00.868 --> 04:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
and just about everyone said you know
 
04:50:02.390 --> 04:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
take it down
 
04:50:04.948 --> 04:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
the corporation should be investigated
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
this is approaches a lot of people
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to see the executives in
 
04:50:12.150 --> 04:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
jail and people just keep asking that
 
04:50:14.310 --> 04:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
same question why did they do this why
 
04:50:15.910 --> 04:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
did they meet this this is being
 
04:50:19.190 --> 04:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
described as something akin to
 
04:50:19.200 --> 04:50:20.070 align:start position:0%
described as something akin to
um

04:50:20.070 --> 04:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:22.150 --> 04:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
saying it's wrong to murder somebody
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
so therefore we're just we're going to
 
04:50:25.270 --> 04:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
go out and make a movie actually
 
04:50:27.030 --> 04:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
murdering somebody and then sending the
 
04:50:29.590 --> 04:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
message this is bad everybody knows
 
04:50:29.600 --> 04:50:31.830 align:start position:0%
message this is bad everybody knows
that

04:50:31.830 --> 04:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:36.150 --> 04:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
well i guess 97 of people know that um
 
04:50:38.708 --> 04:50:38.718 align:start position:0%
sexually explicit material
 
04:50:38.718 --> 04:50:39.670 align:start position:0%
sexually explicit material
um

04:50:39.670 --> 04:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:42.390 --> 04:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
of very very young girls who
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh don't have any life experience yet
 
04:50:45.360 --> 04:50:46.948 align:start position:0%
uh don't have any life experience yet
um

04:50:46.948 --> 04:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:48.628 --> 04:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
you know i i couldn't even describe some
 
04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
of the some of the scenes in here
 
04:50:50.798 --> 04:50:51.910 align:start position:0%
of the some of the scenes in here
um

04:50:51.910 --> 04:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:53.590 --> 04:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't describe some of the scenes
 
04:50:56.230 --> 04:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
in this movie even in this in this room
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's so brazenly illegal it's so
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
brazenly long what they did
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
that it's almost like these
 
04:51:04.390 --> 04:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
federal laws and some of our state laws
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
on sexually explicit material with
 
04:51:08.310 --> 04:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
minors if they were to try to make this
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
movie in new hampshire
 
04:51:13.030 --> 04:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
they probably would have been shut down
 
04:51:14.628 --> 04:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
even when they had the
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know 650
 
04:51:19.510 --> 04:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
girls as young as nine years old sending
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
in material of working and they watched
 
04:51:25.350 --> 04:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of hours of girls
 
04:51:27.190 --> 04:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
doing this and some of them
 
04:51:29.510 --> 04:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
have you know prior convictions and i
 
04:51:31.590 --> 04:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
just think
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
some things kind of walk the line and
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
then other things are just
 
04:51:36.868 --> 04:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
way way
 
04:51:38.788 --> 04:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
way over this was
 
04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's wrong it was illegal and i think
 
04:51:45.110 --> 04:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
this is not what should be put on here
 
04:51:48.240 --> 04:51:49.510 align:start position:0%
this is not what should be put on here
okay

04:51:49.510 --> 04:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:51:51.430 --> 04:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
04:51:54.868 --> 04:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
do i have any uh questions
 
04:51:56.628 --> 04:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
are there any questions at all uh
 
04:51:58.868 --> 04:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
representative market uh thank you
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative for for being here uh
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
just a question uh i'm not i understand
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
not a fan of it sounds terrible but do
 
04:52:10.948 --> 04:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
you think that the
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
this type of uh resolution uh raising
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
awareness about the show you have any
 
04:52:17.910 --> 04:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
concern that this type of thing
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
will uh make more people aware of it
 
04:52:23.510 --> 04:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
than otherwise that has it ever been a
 
04:52:25.750 --> 04:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
concern or something you thought of
 
04:52:25.760 --> 04:52:27.270 align:start position:0%
concern or something you thought of
um

04:52:27.270 --> 04:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:28.550 --> 04:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
is this a concern that more people
 
04:52:31.830 --> 04:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
become aware of the movie uh
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it was a concern when i drafted
 
04:52:35.190 --> 04:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
this i was looking for a different
 
04:52:37.350 --> 04:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
approach maybe if i just wrote if i just
 
04:52:38.470 --> 04:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
write a letter to the department of
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
justice and do this on down below
 
04:52:40.798 --> 04:52:42.550 align:start position:0%
justice and do this on down below
but

04:52:42.550 --> 04:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
um i think that what the goal is
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
for me is to get more and more people to
 
04:52:51.510 --> 04:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
boycott netflix
 
04:52:53.430 --> 04:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
get more people to cancel and i think
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
that people have to see this is what
 
04:52:57.830 --> 04:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
netflix is doing this is the string of
 
04:52:59.430 --> 04:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
movies that hollywood is making that i
 
04:53:02.070 --> 04:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the resolution um this is
 
04:53:03.910 --> 04:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
part of a pattern of putting out
 
04:53:05.910 --> 04:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
sexually explicit material was trying to
 
04:53:07.590 --> 04:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
increasingly sexualize
 
04:53:09.190 --> 04:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
not just teenagers now they're going to
 
04:53:09.200 --> 04:53:13.350 align:start position:0%
not just teenagers now they're going to
preaching

04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:13.360 --> 04:53:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:53:15.510 --> 04:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:53:17.430 --> 04:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
have you heard the expression banned in
 
04:53:20.390 --> 04:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
boston ever
 
04:53:23.670 --> 04:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
and the reason i ask that is because
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
historically there have been cases where
 
04:53:27.910 --> 04:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
books have been banned
 
04:53:29.910 --> 04:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
and books would want to be banned in
 
04:53:32.070 --> 04:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
boston because that would
 
04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
help them to sell more books so that's
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
that's my concern my question is this
 
04:53:39.030 --> 04:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
type of activity making more people
 
04:53:41.190 --> 04:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
aware of it and maybe increasing the
 
04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
viewership of this series uh that was
 
04:53:45.670 --> 04:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
just so bad in boston doesn't ring the
 
04:53:45.680 --> 04:53:46.948 align:start position:0%
just so bad in boston doesn't ring the
bell

04:53:46.948 --> 04:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
bell
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh i'm from seattle and we have other
 
04:53:51.510 --> 04:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
expressions of kind of me in the scene
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
all right all right thank you i i get
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:59.600 --> 04:54:02.420 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:54:02.420 --> 04:54:02.430 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:02.430 --> 04:54:12.628 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:54:12.628 --> 04:54:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:14.830 --> 04:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
i just have a question about um
 
04:54:17.110 --> 04:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
federal authority over these types of
 
04:54:18.390 --> 04:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
things um
 
04:54:18.400 --> 04:54:19.670 align:start position:0%
things um
netflix

04:54:19.670 --> 04:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
netflix
 
04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm saying this night asking this
 
04:54:23.550 --> 04:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
question naively netflix is a
 
04:54:23.560 --> 04:54:25.270 align:start position:0%
question naively netflix is a
cable-based

04:54:25.270 --> 04:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
cable-based
 
04:54:27.750 --> 04:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh company
 
04:54:30.708 --> 04:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
and for example the fcc doesn't that
 
04:54:33.190 --> 04:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
only have authority over things that go
 
04:54:34.628 --> 04:54:34.638 align:start position:0%
through the air
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
ergo um
 
04:54:39.030 --> 04:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't uh for example the fcc not
 
04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
carry weight
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
over this um i might have a follow-up
 
04:54:46.470 --> 04:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
question but go ahead
 
04:54:46.480 --> 04:54:49.110 align:start position:0%
question but go ahead
um

04:54:49.110 --> 04:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:50.788 --> 04:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
i think that things sent over the
 
04:54:50.798 --> 04:54:51.830 align:start position:0%
i think that things sent over the
internet

04:54:51.830 --> 04:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
internet
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know the fcc's charter but i i
 
04:54:57.430 --> 04:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
know that the fcc's jurisdiction is
 
04:54:57.440 --> 04:54:58.788 align:start position:0%
know that the fcc's jurisdiction is
triggered

04:54:58.788 --> 04:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
triggered
 
04:55:00.470 --> 04:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
if things go over the airwaves like
 
04:55:02.788 --> 04:55:02.798 align:start position:0%
through wi-fi and whatnot and
 
04:55:04.390 --> 04:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction that i'm i'm going
 
04:55:06.708 --> 04:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
after is under the department of justice
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:13.350 --> 04:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
no that answers my question thank you
 
04:55:19.030 --> 04:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:21.990 --> 04:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh is there anything else
 
04:55:23.910 --> 04:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
i represent i got a couple questions for
 
04:55:25.350 --> 04:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
you on this here
 
04:55:28.390 --> 04:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh of course i've never seen this here
 
04:55:31.030 --> 04:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
but on like i my wife has a comp for
 
04:55:33.750 --> 04:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
netflix and we watch a lot of movies
 
04:55:33.760 --> 04:55:35.350 align:start position:0%
netflix and we watch a lot of movies
um

04:55:35.350 --> 04:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know in those movies there's some
 
04:55:40.150 --> 04:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
type of nudity like on for instant rain
 
04:55:42.150 --> 04:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
the viking news and all that and the
 
04:55:43.990 --> 04:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
things that i've been watching about the
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
historical data on uh
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
the uh attacks between frank spain and
 
04:55:51.270 --> 04:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
italy and all that stuff and many years
 
04:55:54.070 --> 04:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
ago the 1300s
 
04:55:56.550 --> 04:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
my concern is there's nudity in those
 
04:55:58.390 --> 04:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
there now these are children
 
04:56:00.310 --> 04:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
and there's also in those movies but
 
04:56:01.590 --> 04:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's cable
 
04:56:03.750 --> 04:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
that people paid for
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
is there a lot laws there or i mean how
 
04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
do they do this here
 
04:56:13.350 --> 04:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
with those uh with young 13 15 year olds
 
04:56:15.270 --> 04:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
that got married back then in their
 
04:56:15.280 --> 04:56:16.390 align:start position:0%
that got married back then in their
movies

04:56:16.390 --> 04:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
movies
 
04:56:18.310 --> 04:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
um they're training it whether they are
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
or not i don't know
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's generally done if it does violate
 
04:56:27.190 --> 04:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
federal law does violate 18 usc 2251
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
usually the department of justice opens
 
04:56:30.070 --> 04:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
up a case
 
04:56:32.310 --> 04:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
um on requesting people who have
 
04:56:33.910 --> 04:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
evidence and the fbi does the actual
 
04:56:36.628 --> 04:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
investigation and then the federal
 
04:56:41.350 --> 04:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:43.750 --> 04:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
think of it like somebody
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
going online and trying to find the same
 
04:56:49.110 --> 04:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
material but not in a moving format
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's sold but in some type of uh child
 
04:56:54.150 --> 04:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
pornography or something that's explicit
 
04:56:56.628 --> 04:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
material on 11 and 4 it would be
 
04:56:59.270 --> 04:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
prosecuted in the same way except that
 
04:57:00.868 --> 04:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
you now have corporation netflix
 
04:57:00.878 --> 04:57:02.390 align:start position:0%
you now have corporation netflix
involved

04:57:02.390 --> 04:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
involved
 
04:57:04.230 --> 04:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
will you bring to tell pornography like
 
04:57:05.590 --> 04:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
i said is there
 
04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
children nudity in this thing in its
 
04:57:08.480 --> 04:57:09.510 align:start position:0%
children nudity in this thing in its
film

04:57:09.510 --> 04:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
film
 
04:57:12.550 --> 04:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
there's uh uh partial nudity define
 
04:57:15.110 --> 04:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
partial news what is there is one
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
image where
 
04:57:16.638 --> 04:57:17.430 align:start position:0%
image where
uh

04:57:17.430 --> 04:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:57:19.270 --> 04:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
probably underage girl
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
exposes her bare breast intentionally
 
04:57:23.590 --> 04:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
obviously the director is older to do
 
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
that for that scene
 
04:57:28.230 --> 04:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
there's another one where a girl's
 
04:57:30.390 --> 04:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
pants are pulled down so that her bear
 
04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:39.270 --> 04:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously at some point a jury of
 
04:57:39.280 --> 04:57:40.070 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously at some point a jury of
your

04:57:40.070 --> 04:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:57:42.310 --> 04:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
peers has to look at the material and
 
04:57:43.590 --> 04:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
see and
 
04:57:46.550 --> 04:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know kind of decide is this
 
04:57:50.070 --> 04:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
is it necessary or is this just
 
04:57:52.150 --> 04:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
the reason i asked this here is i had a
 
04:57:52.160 --> 04:57:53.110 align:start position:0%
the reason i asked this here is i had a
mother

04:57:53.110 --> 04:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
mother
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
asked me
 
04:57:55.670 --> 04:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know about this here that her
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
daughter does cheerleading
 
04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
and in some of those cheerleading moves
 
04:58:02.310 --> 04:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
are very seductive or the way they dress
 
04:58:03.990 --> 04:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
and everything else
 
04:58:06.550 --> 04:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
and is that in line with this cutie
 
04:58:06.560 --> 04:58:08.070 align:start position:0%
and is that in line with this cutie
stuff

04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
well what's it called the movie here
 
04:58:12.830 --> 04:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
cuties yeah well
 
04:58:16.708 --> 04:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
i when i was in high school i also saw
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
the the girls at a certain age 16 or 17
 
04:58:20.948 --> 04:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
would sometimes you know push the
 
04:58:20.958 --> 04:58:22.390 align:start position:0%
would sometimes you know push the
boundaries

04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
boundaries
 
04:58:24.310 --> 04:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
but but that was like
 
04:58:26.470 --> 04:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know two seconds of twerking or
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
something this is like seven and a half
 
04:58:30.948 --> 04:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
minutes of pumping and grinding the
 
04:58:32.470 --> 04:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
camera and
 
04:58:34.470 --> 04:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
pumping the ground and
 
04:58:34.480 --> 04:58:35.430 align:start position:0%
pumping the ground and
just

04:58:35.430 --> 04:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
just i mean even trying to remember
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
little snippets of these seeds is just
 
04:58:39.440 --> 04:58:40.788 align:start position:0%
little snippets of these seeds is just
like

04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:58:40.798 --> 04:58:43.350 align:start position:0%
like
if

04:58:43.350 --> 04:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:58:45.190 --> 04:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's not that they push the limits like
 
04:58:47.190 --> 04:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
high school cheerleaders it's
 
04:58:49.350 --> 04:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
they've gone
 
04:58:52.230 --> 04:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
so far over so completely far over it's
 
04:58:52.240 --> 04:58:53.590 align:start position:0%
so far over so completely far over it's
so

04:58:53.590 --> 04:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:56.550 --> 04:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's so undeniably illegal it so
 
04:58:58.550 --> 04:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
violates the spirit of the law that
 
04:58:59.910 --> 04:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
they're just
 
04:59:02.788 --> 04:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
it's not even the same it's true
 
04:59:04.948 --> 04:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
my last question uh for you and i'll go
 
04:59:07.270 --> 04:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
to the representative another question
 
04:59:10.150 --> 04:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
is that uh i aren't there already laws
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
that are already out there that define
 
04:59:14.470 --> 04:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
nudity and define pornography and define
 
04:59:14.480 --> 04:59:15.430 align:start position:0%
nudity and define pornography and define
child

04:59:15.430 --> 04:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:59:17.590 --> 04:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
pornography that are already in place i
 
04:59:20.150 --> 04:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
mean are we looking for them
 
04:59:22.470 --> 04:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
in this here which are the way i read it
 
04:59:24.868 --> 04:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
they tell them
 
04:59:27.670 --> 04:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
comply with the law or we interpreted
 
04:59:29.670 --> 04:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
that we're doing something wrong
 
04:59:29.680 --> 04:59:30.868 align:start position:0%
that we're doing something wrong
that

04:59:30.868 --> 04:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:32.310 --> 04:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
maybe they're not seeing what we're
 
04:59:34.470 --> 04:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
seeing to hear a new answer
 
04:59:37.110 --> 04:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
well again well it's a
 
04:59:38.470 --> 04:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
federal law that the the house
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
resolutions addresses um we
 
04:59:43.270 --> 04:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
could have also gone the uh
 
04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
the the state statute we also have um
 
04:59:49.270 --> 04:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
criminal codes that are also felony
 
04:59:49.280 --> 04:59:50.708 align:start position:0%
criminal codes that are also felony
provisions

04:59:50.708 --> 04:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
04:59:52.390 --> 04:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
um for
 
04:59:54.948 --> 04:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
airing this material in the state
 
04:59:54.958 --> 04:59:56.310 align:start position:0%
airing this material in the state
um

04:59:56.310 --> 04:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:58.390 --> 04:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
my concern there is that in general
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
state laws they usually just go after
 
05:00:02.230 --> 05:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
people after watching this at home
 
05:00:04.830 --> 05:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
naively thinking that it's just a kid's
 
05:00:06.868 --> 05:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
dance group
 
05:00:09.350 --> 05:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
and now instead of netflix which is kind
 
05:00:11.750 --> 05:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
of surprising people very over the top
 
05:00:14.310 --> 05:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
sexualized material now you're putting
 
05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
just ordinary viewers in jeopardy of
 
05:00:19.110 --> 05:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
liberal prison time just for instantly
 
05:00:21.510 --> 05:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
watching the movie that they think
 
05:00:22.948 --> 05:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
you know it can't get bad and then it
 
05:00:24.788 --> 05:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
just works it can't get worse than this
 
05:00:26.708 --> 05:00:26.718 align:start position:0%
and it gets much it can't get through
 
05:00:27.990 --> 05:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
that it gets much
 
05:00:28.000 --> 05:00:28.708 align:start position:0%
that it gets much
so

05:00:28.708 --> 05:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
the state law part i didn't get into
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
because my concern was
 
05:00:33.990 --> 05:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general's office might
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%

05:00:38.550 --> 05:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
prison time real prosecution you know
 
05:00:40.550 --> 05:00:40.560 align:start position:0%

05:00:42.070 --> 05:00:42.080 align:start position:0%

you don't think that when you turn on
 
05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
the tv you're gonna see
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%

05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
riverline child overnight
 
05:00:52.470 --> 05:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
you expect to see
 
05:00:54.948 --> 05:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
material that is lawful
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
material that might push the limits with
 
05:00:58.310 --> 05:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
high school cheerleaders or something
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
like that it doesn't you know

05:01:06.230 --> 05:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
11 year olds you don't expect to see it
 
05:01:07.990 --> 05:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
and it's just kind of
 
05:01:09.830 --> 05:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
a real surprise
 
05:01:11.910 --> 05:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay one last question i thought that
 
05:01:13.990 --> 05:01:14.000 align:start position:0%

05:01:47.430 --> 05:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:49.590 --> 05:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
a political appointee appointed by the
 
05:01:49.600 --> 05:01:50.868 align:start position:0%
a political appointee appointed by the
president

05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
president
 
05:01:50.878 --> 05:01:52.788 align:start position:0%
president
and

05:01:52.788 --> 05:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:56.070 --> 05:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes hollywood gets away with stuff
 
05:01:58.230 --> 05:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
that private citizens could never get
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
away with because they're big political
 
05:02:02.708 --> 05:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
companies uh i mean saw the weinstein
 
05:02:04.628 --> 05:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
case i'm not going to go into that that
 
05:02:05.990 --> 05:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
that was one of the biggest political
 
05:02:07.830 --> 05:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
donors and stuff weinstein was getting
 
05:02:09.430 --> 05:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
away with was just
 
05:02:23.430 --> 05:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:23.440 --> 05:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:54.550 --> 05:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
courts in their criminal courts and of
 
05:02:56.310 --> 05:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
course we have
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know federal state county and local
 
05:02:59.040 --> 05:03:00.868 align:start position:0%
you know federal state county and local
um

05:03:00.868 --> 05:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:02.550 --> 05:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
to pursue something in the civil court
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
you have to have a positive action
 
05:03:06.470 --> 05:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's common law sometimes we
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
come up with that legislature but i
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
think that the cause of action would
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
come from
 
05:03:14.390 --> 05:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh the parents of these girls
 
05:03:14.400 --> 05:03:15.350 align:start position:0%
uh the parents of these girls
uh

05:03:15.350 --> 05:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:03:17.030 --> 05:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
who would be
 
05:03:18.550 --> 05:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
harmed and they would have i believe
 
05:03:20.150 --> 05:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
they would just have a right under the
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
federal the sorry the french courts not
 
05:03:24.390 --> 05:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
the federal courts uh what i'm looking
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
at is just the violations of 18 usc

05:05:12.070 --> 05:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative body you can go ahead
 
05:05:13.990 --> 05:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
and speak to your amendment please yeah
 
05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
so um the amendment essentially if you
 
05:05:18.628 --> 05:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
go to uh the first club the last
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph line is uh 30 and 31 of take
 
05:05:24.310 --> 05:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
one of the original piece of legislation
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that basically what this
 
05:05:28.948 --> 05:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
changes in the ultimate uh purpose is to
 
05:05:31.030 --> 05:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
change the very clock that the house
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
clerk saying honking the best revolution
 
05:05:35.110 --> 05:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
to netflix to remove this bill from
 
05:05:35.120 --> 05:05:36.470 align:start position:0%
to netflix to remove this bill from
distribution

05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
05:05:38.150 --> 05:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
that i would rather instead say that the
 
05:05:39.990 --> 05:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house represents fear by
 
05:05:42.150 --> 05:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
condemning the film's duties an epic
 
05:05:45.030 --> 05:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
decision to release and promote the film
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
and the reason for this is because no
 
05:05:49.190 --> 05:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
duke brought up a statement
 
05:05:51.510 --> 05:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
has been taken by the federal government
 
05:05:54.150 --> 05:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
against the actions of the filmmakers or
 
05:05:57.110 --> 05:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
netflix and i don't find our legislature
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
to be like lawyers or judges where we
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
can just assume
 
05:06:02.470 --> 05:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
time has been committed right we believe
 
05:06:04.628 --> 05:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
in due process in our legislature right
 
05:06:07.350 --> 05:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
we're all constitutional conservatives
 
05:06:11.510 --> 05:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:11.520 --> 05:06:12.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:06:14.230 --> 05:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
i think we need to take um we need to
 
05:06:15.910 --> 05:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
just change this wording so that it's
 
05:06:17.430 --> 05:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
more forthright
 
05:06:19.270 --> 05:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
and knowing that you know the purpose of
 
05:06:21.910 --> 05:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
this is to condemn the movie and to
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
condemn netflix profiting off such a um
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
such inappropriate contract
 
05:06:30.550 --> 05:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
and to ensure that we also still tell
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
the doj to investigate this so that if
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
they have committed a crime right then
 
05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
they can have the full force of the
 
05:06:39.670 --> 05:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
on broadcast so that's the purpose of
 
05:06:41.990 --> 05:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment and i hope that the
 
05:06:44.070 --> 05:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
representatives from both parties are
 
05:06:45.590 --> 05:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
considerate and vote
 
05:06:47.510 --> 05:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you uh do i
 
05:06:50.150 --> 05:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
have anyone else i want to speak uh for
 
05:06:53.350 --> 05:06:53.360 align:start position:0%

05:06:54.868 --> 05:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
you don't see it i don't see anyone on
 
05:06:54.878 --> 05:06:56.550 align:start position:0%
you don't see it i don't see anyone on
here

05:07:03.990 --> 05:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:04.000 --> 05:07:04.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:07:04.830 --> 05:07:04.840 align:start position:0%

05:07:17.590 --> 05:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
that it's hard for me to vote one way or
 
05:07:19.270 --> 05:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
the other without
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%

05:07:22.470 --> 05:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
out there that
 
05:07:24.070 --> 05:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna vote on this then maybe
 
05:07:25.270 --> 05:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
we should
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
first see it
 
05:07:29.750 --> 05:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
because as the supreme court justice who
 
05:07:32.788 --> 05:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
said you know it when you see it i
 
05:07:34.788 --> 05:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
i feel like it's uh
 
05:07:38.628 --> 05:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
i just don't know until i until i see it
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
i you know some i can understand what
 
05:07:42.550 --> 05:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying here and you know how you
 
05:07:44.708 --> 05:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
want to vote that's up to you uh but
 
05:07:46.230 --> 05:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
this bill has been up there for now
 
05:07:47.750 --> 05:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
about a week or two you would definitely
 
05:07:49.990 --> 05:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to do it me i had
 
05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
no interest in watching not just a
 
05:07:54.628 --> 05:07:54.638 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech guys and know that we
 
05:07:56.868 --> 05:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
there's a fine line we got to be careful
 
05:07:56.878 --> 05:07:57.750 align:start position:0%
there's a fine line we got to be careful
on

05:07:57.750 --> 05:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i respect the ones that did their
 
05:08:02.550 --> 05:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
decisions uh the ones that did watch it
 
05:08:02.560 --> 05:08:03.350 align:start position:0%
decisions uh the ones that did watch it
but

05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:08:04.628 --> 05:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
right representatives oh that's i'll
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
just be all you know that's the
 
05:08:08.230 --> 05:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
direction because we're in the gateway
 
05:08:08.240 --> 05:08:09.750 align:start position:0%
direction because we're in the gateway
yes

05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:08:11.670 --> 05:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
so the question is more about the
 
05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
overall hr and right now the question
 
05:08:18.070 --> 05:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
that we've moved is on the amendment
 
05:08:19.990 --> 05:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
so i think this kind of addresses some
 
05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
of your concerns on representative
 
05:08:24.550 --> 05:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
welcoming that we're not saying that any
 
05:08:26.390 --> 05:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
crime has been committing
 
05:08:28.708 --> 05:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
and you know requesting that netflix
 
05:08:29.990 --> 05:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
take it down that currently we're
 
05:08:32.070 --> 05:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
condemning and then we're asking for an
 
05:08:34.868 --> 05:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
investigation to see if this is speech
 
05:08:36.948 --> 05:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
that goes against fdp guidelines and
 
05:08:38.788 --> 05:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
that goes against specific federal
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
statutes and i think you know what
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're kind of bringing up is a debate
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we'll be having after we vote on
 
05:08:47.910 --> 05:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:50.390 --> 05:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay do we have any other uh any
 
05:08:51.590 --> 05:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
anything else everyone had
 
05:08:55.910 --> 05:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
who was
 
05:09:07.670 --> 05:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:09.590 --> 05:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
if there's nobody else right okay
 
05:09:12.550 --> 05:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
without further delay then i'm gonna
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
move to a uh well i can't do a show
 
05:09:19.270 --> 05:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
again so i gotta take a roll call
 
05:09:19.280 --> 05:09:22.628 align:start position:0%
again so i gotta take a roll call
uh

05:09:22.628 --> 05:09:22.638 align:start position:0%

okay why don't we go to the clerk and
 
05:09:25.910 --> 05:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
call for roll call it's kind of tough
 
05:09:28.150 --> 05:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
you haven't and then and now it's the
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
roll call is on an otpa
 
05:09:33.270 --> 05:09:33.280 align:start position:0%

permissible in our society it's quite
 
05:13:45.670 --> 05:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
flexibly illegal from underage nudity to
 
05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%

normally we don't we all get the bills
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and people
 
05:15:48.310 --> 05:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
look in front of us
 
05:15:49.590 --> 05:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
and bring it up if that's what you
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:54.550 --> 05:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
because she's pretty talented knowing
 
05:15:56.230 --> 05:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
that representative did their ranking
 
05:15:56.240 --> 05:15:58.868 align:start position:0%
that representative did their ranking
number

05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:16:02.788 --> 05:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
now when it comes to i.t not at all
 
05:16:02.798 --> 05:16:03.830 align:start position:0%
now when it comes to i.t not at all
again

05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:16:05.990 --> 05:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
no i'm not talented when it comes to
 
05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
anything technological
 
05:16:08.160 --> 05:16:12.070 align:start position:0%
anything technological

05:16:45.590 --> 05:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh can you enlarge it please
 
05:16:50.550 --> 05:16:50.560 align:start position:0%

okay
 
05:16:56.500 --> 05:16:56.510 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:56.510 --> 05:17:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:17:10.070 --> 05:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.310 --> 05:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
i have my glasses on and i still can't
 
05:17:13.670 --> 05:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
see it if you'd like representative
 
05:17:15.990 --> 05:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
massimo i can also email this to you why
 
05:17:18.070 --> 05:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
don't you do that that would be great if
 
05:17:25.910 --> 05:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:27.430 --> 05:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
so what's what's happening right now
 
05:17:29.430 --> 05:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
because we're ready to move forward
 
05:17:31.670 --> 05:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
i know
 
05:17:36.150 --> 05:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:38.470 --> 05:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just want to uh
 
05:17:40.230 --> 05:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
i guess speak out loud or think out loud
 
05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
for a second i don't think
 
05:17:46.390 --> 05:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
anyone here is uh in favor of
 
05:17:48.830 --> 05:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
the descriptions that representative
 
05:17:51.750 --> 05:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
abramson gave to describe this movie but
 
05:17:53.430 --> 05:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm also concerned as
 
05:17:55.830 --> 05:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman alluded to the first
 
05:17:58.150 --> 05:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
amendment implications
 
05:17:59.590 --> 05:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
05:17:59.600 --> 05:18:00.788 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
that

05:18:00.788 --> 05:18:00.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:18:03.270 --> 05:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for this house
 
05:18:04.550 --> 05:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
essentially calling for the censorship
 
05:18:07.910 --> 05:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
of something
 
05:18:07.920 --> 05:18:09.750 align:start position:0%
of something
which

05:18:09.750 --> 05:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:18:11.830 --> 05:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
is known to the department of justice
 
05:18:14.070 --> 05:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
and has apparently been deemed not
 
05:18:14.080 --> 05:18:15.030 align:start position:0%
and has apparently been deemed not
illegal

05:18:15.030 --> 05:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
05:18:17.990 --> 05:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
despite attorney and mr abramson's
 
05:18:19.910 --> 05:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
remarks that it's clearly and obviously
 
05:18:19.920 --> 05:18:21.510 align:start position:0%
remarks that it's clearly and obviously
illegal

05:18:21.510 --> 05:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
and especially given that it appears
 
05:18:25.510 --> 05:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
that none of the members of the
 
05:18:26.948 --> 05:18:26.958 align:start position:0%
committee have actually watched the
 
05:18:26.958 --> 05:18:27.990 align:start position:0%
committee have actually watched the
movie

05:18:27.990 --> 05:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
movie
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think that members of the house
 
05:18:31.430 --> 05:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
should necessarily be
 
05:18:33.030 --> 05:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
censoring things or calling for
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
censorship of things sight unseen
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
even if they're not you know things that
 
05:18:40.628 --> 05:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
we like or things that may be
 
05:18:42.708 --> 05:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
frankly horrifying
 
05:18:44.470 --> 05:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
so what i'd like to know is if there's
 
05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
any other members of the committee
 
05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
especially on
 
05:18:49.750 --> 05:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
your side of the aisle mr chairman that
 
05:18:52.628 --> 05:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
have any support for the idea of voting
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
down this
 
05:18:56.310 --> 05:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
motion and proposing a motion to retain
 
05:18:58.390 --> 05:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
this bill so i don't think it's simply
 
05:18:59.750 --> 05:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to be voting on
 
05:19:02.470 --> 05:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
something sight unseen with the
 
05:19:04.948 --> 05:19:04.958 align:start position:0%
implications that such a vote has
 
05:19:06.040 --> 05:19:06.050 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh
 
05:19:06.050 --> 05:19:07.670 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh
[Music]

05:19:07.670 --> 05:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:12.868 --> 05:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
i'll address that real quick and i
 
05:19:14.550 --> 05:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
definitely see you know the gentleman's
 
05:19:16.868 --> 05:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
concern involved thank you mr speaker i
 
05:19:18.788 --> 05:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
mean i definitely see the gentleman
 
05:19:18.798 --> 05:19:20.470 align:start position:0%
mean i definitely see the gentleman
representative

05:19:20.470 --> 05:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:19:22.070 --> 05:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
but i think um as the chairman
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
previously alluded to we did have two
 
05:19:26.470 --> 05:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
weeks to view or do research on this and
 
05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:42.948 --> 05:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's not to force them off the air and
 
05:19:45.030 --> 05:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's to request that the federal
 
05:19:47.110 --> 05:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
government we're just requesting federal
 
05:19:49.750 --> 05:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
government look into the tf2 laws have
 
05:19:52.390 --> 05:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
been violated but an apparently you know
 
05:19:54.470 --> 05:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
we have the fcc that's allowed to repeat
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
what kinds of things go on here whether
 
05:19:59.110 --> 05:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's on netflix or in our table so this
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
is just requesting that they double
 
05:20:02.948 --> 05:20:02.958 align:start position:0%
check into this after we condemn the
 
05:20:04.550 --> 05:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
kind of things that we've heard about
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
and we've heard about their constituents
 
05:20:08.868 --> 05:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
have problems with a concern so i
 
05:20:11.190 --> 05:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
definitely see your reservations but
 
05:20:13.430 --> 05:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're jumping the gun
 
05:20:14.550 --> 05:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
per se
 
05:20:17.110 --> 05:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
on this i think there's a lot of for me
 
05:20:20.310 --> 05:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.310 --> 05:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative you took the
 
05:20:27.910 --> 05:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
words right out of the remote because i
 
05:20:30.310 --> 05:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
did not feel like you watch it but i did
 
05:20:32.470 --> 05:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
research the uh information that was out
 
05:20:34.708 --> 05:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
there on it we all have plenty of time
 
05:20:36.150 --> 05:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
and i want to thank each and every one
 
05:20:38.310 --> 05:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
of my committee members here because
 
05:20:40.150 --> 05:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
when we caught this you all did your
 
05:20:41.910 --> 05:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
homework on it came up with amendment
 
05:20:43.910 --> 05:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
and everything else so we're ready to
 
05:20:47.030 --> 05:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
vote we cannot take others by the end
 
05:20:48.948 --> 05:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
and show them how to research or how to
 
05:20:51.110 --> 05:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
look and do things prior to a community
 
05:20:53.590 --> 05:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
hearing uh but i want to thank the
 
05:20:55.830 --> 05:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh i don't know if he's
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
probably a freshman and it could be a
 
05:20:58.868 --> 05:20:58.878 align:start position:0%
lesson learned
 
05:21:02.390 --> 05:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
to do homework prior to looking there
 
05:21:04.310 --> 05:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
like we've done here and everyone that
 
05:21:06.868 --> 05:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
came in with their regular lock but
 
05:21:08.230 --> 05:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
anyways i want to move forward if
 
05:21:09.670 --> 05:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
there's anyone else that wants to speak
 
05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
up i'm ready to go to a vote yes uh
 
05:21:13.990 --> 05:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative lane can you take it off
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%

i feel like
 
05:21:25.990 --> 05:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
05:21:28.470 --> 05:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know basically confirming what is
 
05:21:28.480 --> 05:21:29.510 align:start position:0%
you know basically confirming what is
already

05:21:29.510 --> 05:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know illegal and uh
 
05:21:34.550 --> 05:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know though i'm a democrat
 
05:21:34.560 --> 05:21:35.510 align:start position:0%
you know though i'm a democrat
um

05:21:35.510 --> 05:21:35.520 align:start position:0%

i'm
 
05:21:39.430 --> 05:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
going to be supporting this because
 
05:21:41.670 --> 05:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's already illegal
 
05:21:42.868 --> 05:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
to have
 
05:21:45.590 --> 05:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
any performers under the age of 18
 
05:21:49.030 --> 05:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i feel like you know
 
05:21:51.590 --> 05:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be afraid to vote one way
 
05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
or the other and i'm sorry i'm going to
 
05:21:54.788 --> 05:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
support it
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative laughlin um
 
05:21:59.270 --> 05:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
i mean there's a lot of things that come
 
05:22:10.628 --> 05:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:13.510 --> 05:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i want to echo
 
05:22:16.150 --> 05:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative piedra's concerns i had
 
05:22:17.830 --> 05:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
the same concerns
 
05:22:19.830 --> 05:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh which is why
 
05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why an amendment came
 
05:22:22.000 --> 05:22:23.350 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why an amendment came
forth

05:22:23.350 --> 05:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
forth
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
and again this is just a resolution like
 
05:22:27.350 --> 05:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
the chairman and like i think most of
 
05:22:29.990 --> 05:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
you i'm a very big first amendment
 
05:22:32.390 --> 05:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
supporter and i expressed concern about
 
05:22:33.910 --> 05:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
a slippery slope
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment addresses my concern
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
and i can i can support this as amended
 
05:22:41.830 --> 05:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
so anyway i deal with
 
05:22:41.840 --> 05:22:42.948 align:start position:0%
so anyway i deal with
uh

05:22:42.948 --> 05:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:22:45.670 --> 05:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
for example gandra said and uh share
 
05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
sentiments but but the amendment uh
 
05:22:50.948 --> 05:22:50.958 align:start position:0%
sense defies my concerns this
 
05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
again it's just a resolution
 
05:22:53.200 --> 05:22:53.990 align:start position:0%
again it's just a resolution
uh

05:22:53.990 --> 05:22:54.000 align:start position:0%

05:28:22.470 --> 05:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
um introducing this again last year i
 
05:28:24.948 --> 05:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
asked legislative services
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
to do this as a house resolution somehow
 
05:28:29.350 --> 05:28:29.360 align:start position:0%

05:28:37.270 --> 05:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
without changing the the rules so
 
05:28:37.280 --> 05:28:38.150 align:start position:0%
without changing the the rules so
this

05:28:38.150 --> 05:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:28:39.590 --> 05:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously through this
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%

passed unanimously through the house
 
05:28:44.948 --> 05:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:28:46.948 --> 05:28:46.958 align:start position:0%
because of the coronavirus lockdown this
 
05:28:48.948 --> 05:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
this bill ended up getting killed so
 
05:28:48.958 --> 05:28:51.510 align:start position:0%
this bill ended up getting killed so
just

05:28:51.510 --> 05:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:55.750 --> 05:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:58.070 --> 05:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
it got killed based on uh some of the
 
05:29:00.230 --> 05:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
senate rules but here i'm redoing it as
 
05:29:04.708 --> 05:29:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:06.868 --> 05:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
05:29:09.110 --> 05:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
binford and greeson and ankerberg and i
 
05:29:11.110 --> 05:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
worked on this bill last year i worked
 
05:29:13.670 --> 05:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
with uh representative albsaro to to get
 
05:29:13.680 --> 05:29:15.350 align:start position:0%
with uh representative albsaro to to get
this

05:29:15.350 --> 05:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
correct the the the source of the
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
problem is that we've noticed over the
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
years that there's been a much higher
 
05:29:23.110 --> 05:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
suicide rate among armed service
 
05:29:23.120 --> 05:29:24.150 align:start position:0%
suicide rate among armed service
veterans

05:29:24.150 --> 05:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
05:29:25.910 --> 05:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
than amongst the general public and at
 
05:29:27.430 --> 05:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
some points it's been as high as twice
 
05:29:28.868 --> 05:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
as high
 
05:29:30.548 --> 05:29:30.558 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what all the reasons
 
05:29:32.788 --> 05:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
are that are contributing to that um we
 
05:29:36.390 --> 05:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
have seen it decline uh from 22 a day
 
05:29:39.270 --> 05:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
down to 21 a day last year we don't have
 
05:29:41.510 --> 05:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
2020s numbers in but they're expecting
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
the numbers to go up again
 
05:29:44.638 --> 05:29:45.990 align:start position:0%
the numbers to go up again
and

05:29:45.990 --> 05:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:46.000 --> 05:29:47.110 align:start position:0%
and
there

05:29:47.110 --> 05:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:29:48.628 --> 05:29:48.638 align:start position:0%
have been so many issues have been
 
05:29:50.548 --> 05:29:50.558 align:start position:0%
brought up over the years by veterans
 
05:29:53.190 --> 05:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
what they think is contributing to
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
these these problems
 
05:29:57.430 --> 05:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
we found out
 
05:30:00.470 --> 05:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
after noticing that that non-veterans
 
05:30:02.548 --> 05:30:02.558 align:start position:0%
in the private sector who had been
 
05:30:05.350 --> 05:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
prescribed opioids and benzodiazepines
 
05:30:07.030 --> 05:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
at the same time each had a slightly
 
05:30:07.040 --> 05:30:09.110 align:start position:0%
at the same time each had a slightly
higher

05:30:09.110 --> 05:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
higher
 
05:30:10.548 --> 05:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
suicide risk and higher rates of
 
05:30:12.470 --> 05:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
depression if they were used but if they
 
05:30:14.628 --> 05:30:14.638 align:start position:0%
were used together at the same time they
 
05:30:17.270 --> 05:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
had dramatically higher rates
 
05:30:21.030 --> 05:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:23.750 --> 05:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
there have been several other issues
 
05:30:25.110 --> 05:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
05:30:28.230 --> 05:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
um i missed the ptsd issue which i
 
05:30:29.830 --> 05:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
thought should have been obvious people
 
05:30:31.270 --> 05:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
have been exposed
 
05:30:31.280 --> 05:30:32.070 align:start position:0%
have been exposed
to

05:30:32.070 --> 05:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:30:32.080 --> 05:30:33.350 align:start position:0%
to
stress

05:30:33.350 --> 05:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
stress
 
05:30:35.270 --> 05:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
combat and seeing
 
05:30:37.830 --> 05:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
close friends die in front of them
 
05:30:39.750 --> 05:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
and subject to torture when they come
 
05:30:41.910 --> 05:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
back they have a very very difficult
 
05:30:41.920 --> 05:30:43.110 align:start position:0%
back they have a very very difficult
time

05:30:43.110 --> 05:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
coming back from combat and coming back
 
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
from very long deployments
 
05:30:49.510 --> 05:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh trying to adjust
 
05:30:51.990 --> 05:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
some are not able to adjust
 
05:30:54.310 --> 05:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
and they go from a kind of type a
 
05:30:56.230 --> 05:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
warrior mentality they come back and
 
05:30:58.548 --> 05:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
they have to just just be uh
 
05:30:58.558 --> 05:30:59.990 align:start position:0%
they have to just just be uh
workers

05:30:59.990 --> 05:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
workers
 
05:31:01.670 --> 05:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
for nine to five
 
05:31:03.830 --> 05:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
a number of veterans have posted
 
05:31:05.910 --> 05:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
and said that they have uh
 
05:31:07.350 --> 05:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
veterans often have a difficult time
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
they're the rescuers they have a
 
05:31:10.868 --> 05:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
difficult time asking for help
 
05:31:13.110 --> 05:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
one's responding to help on that that
 
05:31:16.628 --> 05:31:16.638 align:start position:0%
also came up in uh last year's bill
 
05:31:19.670 --> 05:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
emergency under suicide which also faced
 
05:31:20.868 --> 05:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
very high
 
05:31:23.110 --> 05:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
rate of uh
 
05:31:25.590 --> 05:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
they face a high suicide rate also
 
05:31:27.830 --> 05:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
um this one the amendment that i i'm
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
asking members to support is sponsored
 
05:31:32.150 --> 05:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
by representative binford
 
05:31:34.548 --> 05:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
and it adds a long list of other
 
05:31:36.628 --> 05:31:36.638 align:start position:0%
chemicals that are known to have
 
05:31:40.150 --> 05:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
psychoactive effects and also adds
 
05:31:40.160 --> 05:31:42.070 align:start position:0%
psychoactive effects and also adds
ptsd

05:31:42.070 --> 05:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
ptsd
 
05:31:44.548 --> 05:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
and exposure to
 
05:31:46.470 --> 05:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
certain vaccines
 
05:31:48.070 --> 05:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
some of the chemicals
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
we think might be associated with high
 
05:31:51.670 --> 05:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
rates of depression
 
05:31:51.680 --> 05:31:52.868 align:start position:0%
rates of depression
um

05:31:52.868 --> 05:31:52.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:55.350 --> 05:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
and uh and other neurological problems
 
05:31:57.270 --> 05:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
chemical problems
 
05:31:59.510 --> 05:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
um they can develop in the brain and can
 
05:31:59.520 --> 05:32:00.390 align:start position:0%
um they can develop in the brain and can
and

05:32:00.390 --> 05:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:32:02.390 --> 05:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
can develop over time
 
05:32:03.590 --> 05:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
i can't even pronounce some of the
 
05:32:05.670 --> 05:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
chemicals that our military guys are
 
05:32:07.750 --> 05:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
exposed to but i'll i'll give you a
 
05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
quick story when i
 
05:32:12.948 --> 05:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
left army rotc i went back home after i
 
05:32:14.310 --> 05:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
left college
 
05:32:16.948 --> 05:32:16.958 align:start position:0%
i wasn't able to continue with rotc and
 
05:32:19.110 --> 05:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
i remember specifically pushing the
 
05:32:21.750 --> 05:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
lawnmower i was i think 19 or 20 years
 
05:32:23.110 --> 05:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
old i was pushing the lawnmower and
 
05:32:24.628 --> 05:32:24.638 align:start position:0%
thinking and thinking and thinking if i
 
05:32:26.868 --> 05:32:26.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to enlist
 
05:32:28.390 --> 05:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
as an enlisted man i was going to go
 
05:32:30.708 --> 05:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
become an officer in the army
 
05:32:32.788 --> 05:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
and i remember thinking of something
 
05:32:34.708 --> 05:32:34.718 align:start position:0%
that george washington said he said that
 
05:32:36.708 --> 05:32:36.718 align:start position:0%
our ability to recruit soldiers for our
 
05:32:39.190 --> 05:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
future wars depends on how we treat
 
05:32:42.548 --> 05:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
the veterans of our our past wars
 
05:32:44.868 --> 05:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
and i remember at that time as a young
 
05:32:46.628 --> 05:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
man thinking whether or not i would go
 
05:32:46.638 --> 05:32:47.510 align:start position:0%
man thinking whether or not i would go
in

05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:32:49.430 --> 05:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
and remembering all the stories from the
 
05:32:52.310 --> 05:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
prior service guys from rotc all the
 
05:32:53.830 --> 05:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
things that they'd said that they'd been
 
05:32:53.840 --> 05:32:54.788 align:start position:0%
things that they'd said that they'd been
through

05:32:54.788 --> 05:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:32:56.310 --> 05:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
in the military the chemicals that
 
05:32:57.910 --> 05:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
they'd been exposed to
 
05:32:57.920 --> 05:32:59.430 align:start position:0%
they'd been exposed to
and

05:32:59.430 --> 05:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:02.708 --> 05:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
what they had been exposed to
 
05:33:05.590 --> 05:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
through the va and the va hospitals and
 
05:33:06.868 --> 05:33:06.878 align:start position:0%
dealing with the department of defense
 
05:33:09.270 --> 05:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
and bureaucracy
 
05:33:10.788 --> 05:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
and the medical problems that they dealt
 
05:33:10.798 --> 05:33:12.310 align:start position:0%
and the medical problems that they dealt
with

05:33:12.310 --> 05:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
and at the time that was my reason for
 
05:33:14.638 --> 05:33:15.350 align:start position:0%
and at the time that was my reason for
not

05:33:15.350 --> 05:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:33:17.670 --> 05:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
going in and enlisting and re-enlisting
 
05:33:19.990 --> 05:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
going from rotc to enlistment
 
05:33:22.390 --> 05:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i thought
 
05:33:22.400 --> 05:33:23.430 align:start position:0%
and i thought
uh

05:33:23.430 --> 05:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
you know when i was out on a merchant
 
05:33:27.030 --> 05:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
ship we were going into war zones as i
 
05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
was telling uh uh chairman balbosaro
 
05:33:31.910 --> 05:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
we had all these military guys and we
 
05:33:34.070 --> 05:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
were bringing military personnel to the
 
05:33:36.548 --> 05:33:36.558 align:start position:0%
middle east and uh to into these
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
theaters of operation and thinking
 
05:33:41.590 --> 05:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know we're in a hazardous zone now
 
05:33:43.270 --> 05:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
but a lot of these guys are not going to
 
05:33:44.868 --> 05:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
come back and some of them didn't come
 
05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
back some of them died over there
 
05:33:47.280 --> 05:33:48.390 align:start position:0%
back some of them died over there
and

05:33:48.390 --> 05:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:48.400 --> 05:33:49.190 align:start position:0%
and
it

05:33:49.190 --> 05:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:33:51.510 --> 05:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
it becomes impossible for us
 
05:33:53.270 --> 05:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
as a society
 
05:33:53.280 --> 05:33:55.350 align:start position:0%
as a society
to

05:33:55.350 --> 05:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:33:57.670 --> 05:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
to recruit these guys
 
05:33:59.590 --> 05:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
um to serve
 
05:34:01.670 --> 05:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
if we're not going to do everything we
 
05:34:04.310 --> 05:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
possibly can now after the fact for our
 
05:34:06.470 --> 05:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
armed service veterans there's the
 
05:34:08.548 --> 05:34:08.558 align:start position:0%
reason that i got back into
 
05:34:10.070 --> 05:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
legislative stuff i dropped out of
 
05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
politics some years ago the reason i got
 
05:34:14.708 --> 05:34:14.718 align:start position:0%
back into it is because of measures like
 
05:34:16.868 --> 05:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
this because of issues like i wanted to
 
05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
help take care of our armed service
 
05:34:18.240 --> 05:34:19.270 align:start position:0%
help take care of our armed service
veterans

05:34:19.270 --> 05:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
05:34:21.750 --> 05:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
they put forth so much they've risked so
 
05:34:23.430 --> 05:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
much and they've sacrificed so much from
 
05:34:25.350 --> 05:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
their family lives their personal lives
 
05:34:26.948 --> 05:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
and their financial lives they've given
 
05:34:28.150 --> 05:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
up so much
 
05:34:30.548 --> 05:34:30.558 align:start position:0%
and we need to ask each generation as
 
05:34:32.708 --> 05:34:32.718 align:start position:0%
they come along when they're you know
 
05:34:34.070 --> 05:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
pushing the lawnmower and they're facing
 
05:34:35.750 --> 05:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
that decision do they just go right back
 
05:34:37.510 --> 05:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
to the private sector
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
do they uh do they go in and serve in
 
05:34:42.070 --> 05:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
uniform and i think it
 
05:34:43.750 --> 05:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
there there's only a little bit that we
 
05:34:44.628 --> 05:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
can do
 
05:34:46.788 --> 05:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
at the legislators but i'm gonna do
 
05:34:48.230 --> 05:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
everything that i can
 
05:34:50.470 --> 05:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
and stuff i am happy to reintroduce this
 
05:34:52.708 --> 05:34:52.718 align:start position:0%
house resolution and i hope that the i
 
05:34:54.150 --> 05:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
hope the department of veterans affairs
 
05:34:55.270 --> 05:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i hope that congress will hold
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
hearings and look into all of these
 
05:34:59.030 --> 05:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
possible contributors to veteran
 
05:35:02.310 --> 05:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
suicides so we're still at 21 21 veteran
 
05:35:04.230 --> 05:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
suicides per day we don't have last
 
05:35:06.868 --> 05:35:06.878 align:start position:0%
year's figures in yet but
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
i i can't imagine that
 
05:35:12.788 --> 05:35:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:25.190 --> 05:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:29.270 --> 05:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
you realize that since marks at 75
 
05:35:40.230 --> 05:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:41.910 --> 05:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
the veterans that i've had the
 
05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
05:35:46.230 --> 05:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
continue to tell me
 
05:35:56.310 --> 05:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:59.110 --> 05:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh i've had that discussion with
 
05:36:04.628 --> 05:36:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:07.910 --> 05:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're making steps to do this to reduce
 
05:36:07.920 --> 05:36:08.708 align:start position:0%
you're making steps to do this to reduce
it

05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:36:10.788 --> 05:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
however um
 
05:36:12.470 --> 05:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
if the
 
05:36:15.590 --> 05:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
vet that goes into the hospital or
 
05:36:18.868 --> 05:36:18.878 align:start position:0%

how do i say it
 
05:36:22.070 --> 05:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't has it have his own sense of
 
05:36:22.080 --> 05:36:23.190 align:start position:0%
doesn't has it have his own sense of

05:36:23.190 --> 05:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
honor
 
05:36:26.470 --> 05:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
he takes those pills and immediately
 
05:36:42.830 --> 05:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:45.910 --> 05:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
bill there a question there somewhere
 
05:36:48.230 --> 05:36:48.240 align:start position:0%

hope that this investigation finds
christianity

05:36:59.110 --> 05:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
christianity
 
05:37:01.430 --> 05:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
um opioids and benzodiazepines in
 
05:37:01.440 --> 05:37:02.628 align:start position:0%
um opioids and benzodiazepines in
general

05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
general
 
05:37:02.638 --> 05:37:04.470 align:start position:0%
general
uh

05:37:04.470 --> 05:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:05.830 --> 05:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
05:37:07.270 --> 05:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
according to a couple veterans i talked
 
05:37:08.868 --> 05:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
to is that there were cuts and
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
benefits va services for counseling and
 
05:37:13.990 --> 05:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
so sometimes if they didn't have enough
 
05:37:15.990 --> 05:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
counselors and therapists that they
 
05:37:18.390 --> 05:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
would just kind of medicate the problem
 
05:37:20.470 --> 05:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
right and that and that's just
 
05:37:21.350 --> 05:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
too much
 
05:37:23.510 --> 05:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative i've been in the va since
 
05:37:23.520 --> 05:37:29.190 align:start position:0%
representative i've been in the va since
2000

05:37:29.190 --> 05:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:31.670 --> 05:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
three places that operate in a tent
 
05:37:33.270 --> 05:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
um they're too hot
 
05:37:35.910 --> 05:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
heart attacks had cancer and stomach and
 
05:37:37.350 --> 05:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know i mean whatever but the bottom
 
05:37:39.510 --> 05:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
line is i used to be given oxycodone
 
05:37:41.110 --> 05:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
like candy and i would use the
 
05:37:42.948 --> 05:37:42.958 align:start position:0%
prescriptions all the time
 
05:37:45.190 --> 05:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh throughout the va but i can tell you
 
05:37:46.868 --> 05:37:46.878 align:start position:0%
throughout the years that somebody who
 
05:37:49.270 --> 05:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
other just thoughts about it uses the
 
05:37:49.280 --> 05:37:50.230 align:start position:0%
other just thoughts about it uses the
system

05:37:50.230 --> 05:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:37:51.510 --> 05:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
the being is
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
so much better
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay on this here on uh they're throwing
 
05:37:56.548 --> 05:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
out these bills they're putting through
 
05:37:59.590 --> 05:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
paying clinics everything else so i mean
 
05:38:01.350 --> 05:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
but years ago representative longwood
 
05:38:04.070 --> 05:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
100 right it was like candy they were
 
05:38:06.070 --> 05:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
given to you sometimes i would get them
 
05:38:08.150 --> 05:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the mail you know i mean and then
 
05:38:10.310 --> 05:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
smash them and stuff and then sometimes
 
05:38:12.230 --> 05:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
somebody would steal them
 
05:38:14.470 --> 05:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay so you know but like i said the va
 
05:38:16.310 --> 05:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
is getting done many of these studies
 
05:38:17.830 --> 05:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
are being done
 
05:38:19.910 --> 05:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
um through the va because i like i said
 
05:38:22.390 --> 05:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'm i use them constantly
 
05:38:24.150 --> 05:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
but the thing what i liked about here
 
05:38:25.750 --> 05:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
with coming forward was representative
 
05:38:27.670 --> 05:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
london's comments about things that
 
05:38:30.788 --> 05:38:30.798 align:start position:0%
that's been complaining
 
05:38:32.390 --> 05:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
in this chiropractor and certain
 
05:38:34.390 --> 05:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
different other type of specialty
 
05:38:36.150 --> 05:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
you know things here which is gonna make
 
05:38:38.470 --> 05:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
us so much better why we're all happy
 
05:38:39.830 --> 05:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
about it so
 
05:38:39.840 --> 05:38:41.430 align:start position:0%
about it so
um

05:38:41.430 --> 05:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
i just wanna and we you remember last
 
05:38:46.868 --> 05:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
time we did pass your momentum
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
resolution and that's why i'm hoping
 
05:38:50.230 --> 05:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
we'll assume we're going to go to a boat
 
05:38:52.548 --> 05:38:52.558 align:start position:0%
to this here so and i'll leave it to it
 
05:38:55.510 --> 05:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
because i have questions
 
05:38:58.070 --> 05:38:58.080 align:start position:0%

05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%

05:50:00.110 --> 05:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
time and we've got um
 
05:50:04.390 --> 05:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
hb112 well 114 and 117
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
could we do them since we've had the
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
hearings one of my um representatives um
 
05:50:14.310 --> 05:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
republicans uh doctor got called out he
 
05:50:16.708 --> 05:50:16.718 align:start position:0%
had to leave
 
05:50:16.718 --> 05:50:18.230 align:start position:0%
had to leave
anymore

05:50:18.230 --> 05:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:50:19.750 --> 05:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know for them that's why he's pretty
 
05:50:21.510 --> 05:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
exact so i
 
05:50:22.760 --> 05:50:22.770 align:start position:0%
out of respect uh
 
05:50:22.770 --> 05:50:23.990 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
because he's been here all day and they
 
05:50:27.110 --> 05:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
got called out so
 
05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%

05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
exact them but he left so we're not
 
05:50:33.910 --> 05:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
doing it is that correct normally i
 
05:50:35.030 --> 05:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
would say how the hell are you going to
 
05:50:36.788 --> 05:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
go you got to go but because he's a
 
05:50:36.798 --> 05:50:38.070 align:start position:0%
go you got to go but because he's a
doctor

05:50:38.070 --> 05:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
05:50:40.708 --> 05:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
