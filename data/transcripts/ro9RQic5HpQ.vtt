all right we'll open uh the work session
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
again on House Bill 5 506 I know that
 
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.770 align:start position:0%
again on House Bill 5 506 I know that
the

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
oh the fire representative from Windham
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
would like to speak I was just
 
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 align:start position:0%
a scheduling conflict
 
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
I think we all know you but for the
 
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
record if you could state your name
 
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
please and thank you Mr chair Daniel
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
Popovich Miller representative from
 
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
Wyndham and as it was mentioned I do
 
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
have a scheduled conflict I much
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the committee's willingness
 
00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
to give me my one minute at the
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
beginning so I can go back to finance
 
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.689 align:start position:0%
beginning so I can go back to finance
too

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:03.770 align:start position:0%
too
foreign

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that in regards to
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
this bill my concern for it was that it
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
was an opportunity for everybody
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
involved to be able to speak up and for
 
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
the community to get involved and help
 
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
determine what the right solution is
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
going forward together with the
 
00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation and you
 
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
know everybody affected by it and I just
 
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to State for the record that
 
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.510 align:start position:0%
wanted to State for the record that
because

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
major benefits that in my opinion a
 
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
tunnel would have over the proposed
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
currently proposed solution I do support
 
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
the you know tunnel option
 
00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
that's again my personal position I just
 
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
speak for myself but I wanted to make
 
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
that clear my concern is that it's a
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
value proposition sometimes saving a few
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
dollars while seriously impacting the
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
usability of the project is not the best
 
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
choice and in my opinion the tunnel will
 
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
be the best value in terms of the
 
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
benefits that we'll get versus the
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
reasonably small additional uh funding
 
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.230 align:start position:0%
reasonably small additional uh funding
required

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
really appreciate you coming in
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
I know the prime sponsor would like to
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
add a few words before we go much
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
further sure if you could just state
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
your name again for the record sure

I just wanted to highlight some bullet
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
points just to kind of wrap this all up
 
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.029 align:start position:0%
points just to kind of wrap this all up

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
um real quick so
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
the the the tunnel
 
00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:51.899 align:start position:0%
was in the original design of this
 
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
project the tunnel was in the plan that
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%

this project the board of directors

approve anything

despite being Consulting parties to the
 
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:32.700 align:start position:0%

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
submitted an alternative plan to the dot
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
and the dot ran with it
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
internal documents from the dot
 
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
questioned this move both from a safety
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
and environmental standpoint
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
the flood plain has been reduced from
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
100 years to 50.

manager Wendy Johnson the town stance
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
has evolved to support the position to
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
build a rail trail specific Culvert on

the straight through alignment

in June 8th of that same year a month
later

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
the response back was after much
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
consideration and deliberation it is
 
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
difficult with heavy heart that we say
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
we are going to proceed with the
 
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
combination of the two structures we
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
truly value and appreciate the town's
 
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
input and although this is not the
 
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
town's preference this is a email from
 
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
Wendy Johnson to the public works
 
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
director of the town of Derry although
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
this is not the town's preference we
 
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
hope that the town will be able to
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
support this difficult decision this is
 
00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
a year later May 7th the Boston EPA
 
00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:19.019 align:start position:0%
office expresses concerns about flooding
 
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
and management of the wetlands with this
 
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.750 align:start position:0%
and management of the wetlands with this
alternative

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519 align:start position:0%
and finally in September of 22 just a
 
00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.590 align:start position:0%
and finally in September of 22 just a
mere

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
mere
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
five months ago
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
the public finally hears and a public
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
hearing occurs with the dot telling
 
00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:35.339 align:start position:0%
residents that their concerns will be
 
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration
 
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
the dot told the town it is building the
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
alternative this proves that that public
 
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
hearing was a sham
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
not a single person in any public
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
hearing advocated for the spaghetti
 
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.090 align:start position:0%
hearing advocated for the spaghetti
Trail

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
Trail
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
for the tunnel plan to be altered
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
and the May 7 2021 email from derry's
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
Public Works director specifically asked
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
the dot not to do it
 
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
no rail trail or outdoor recreation
 
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
so we get to the point of the dot
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
setting sending a threatening letter to
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
the council to manipulate a vote
 
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
so the council instead votes to not
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
spend any additional money as they have
 
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
a contract with the state
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
that was the vote the town did not vote
 
00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:40.019 align:start position:0%
for the alternative plan
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
that did not occur
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
and many Council has expressed their
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
opinion to keep the tunnel in the design
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
that is a summation of what amounts to
 
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:53.459 align:start position:0%
five inches of
 
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
submitted documentation emails
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
to cover the gist of this particular
 
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.050 align:start position:0%

well they've done
 
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:55.610 align:start position:0%
well they've done
um

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
I can tell you this I can tell you that
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
there have been studies that have looked
 
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
at that by out outside folks
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
um I have two businesses in my own town
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
that exists solely because of the
 
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
success of the rail trail that would not
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
be there otherwise
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen six
 
00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:14.339 align:start position:0%
um the re-establishment of a prior
 
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
closed business in at Windham Junction
 
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:23.459 align:start position:0%
the ancillary economic benefit of of
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
these of this particular piece of rail
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
bed had been studied by I think a group
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
out of unh and that's where they get
 
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
that from and they're better to clarify
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
its origin than I am
 
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
it's this
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
thank you and where and we're you know
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
we're still we don't even have a
 
00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:50.090 align:start position:0%
we're still we don't even have a
completed

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
completed
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
the the trail is is not even yet
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
completed and we're seeing these huge
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
numbers so the benefit
 
00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
um will only increase from there when we
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
have the ability to
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
to pass all the way through from Salem
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
up to Manchester and and uh and vice
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
versa back to Salem certainly
 
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that sorry I
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
thought since it was passed out during
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
your Testament I thought but thank you
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
no problem
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
for other questions representative
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
seeing none I just had I want to thank
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
you for the work I think you probably
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
should be on the finance committee
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
because you're so thorough but I I might
 
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
have been asked to be on the finance
 
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
committee by the chairman of finance and
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
all right so you know further questions
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
sure thank you awesome thank you guys
 
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:42.620 align:start position:0%
too for all of you for for your
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
so just a quick where are we
 
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler and I had a
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
meeting on Friday with the speaker and
 
00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.449 align:start position:0%
meeting on Friday with the speaker and
others

00:15:58.449 --> 00:15:58.459 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
to talk about this has gained quite a
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
bit of attention
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that came up is
 
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
perhaps that we would put it in the
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
budget the item has been discussed
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
thoroughly it's a budget year but I
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
don't want to take away from what folks
 
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
may have out there to say further but I
 
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
just want to let you know where we might
 
00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019 align:start position:0%
be going with it
 
00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:19.790 align:start position:0%
be going with it
um

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%

development stages that's truly the
 
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:43.909 align:start position:0%
development stages that's truly the
beginning

00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
there's 200 Acres of this project that's
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
on the east side of I-93 between the

highway and the town of Derry line we
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
call it the east side and for decades
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
it's waited for exit 4A
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
in the 4A area every opportunity
 
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
involves serious investment in New
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire serious job creation not
 
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
dozens of jobs but hundreds of jobs and
 
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
every one of these conversations ends
 
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
the same way very exciting let us know
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
when the road's done
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
um phase a of the exit project is
 
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
finally underway after decades you've
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
heard about it Decades of studies
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
permitting design changes budget gaps uh
 
00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:51.539 align:start position:0%
rfps High bids new studies staff changes
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
retirements I can give you more reasons
 
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
we're closer than we ever have before
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
but phase a is just part of the story it
 
00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
is currently a road that excuse me does
 
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
not connect to other public roads it
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
needs phase B where this tunnel
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
path debate is occurring and then phase
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
C to connect to the Derry Public Road
 
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.529 align:start position:0%

00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
we are at we Pillsbury actively
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
negotiating with multiple parties but as
 
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
this committee has heard from many
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
people over the years time kills these
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
deals and new and additional delays even
 
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
small delays after so many delays will
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
kill these deals too and it's these big
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
deals have real consequences to the
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
state to job creation housing creation
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
all the things that I know are
 
00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:48.539 align:start position:0%
priorities in the state house and for
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
it's been mentioned by a few speakers
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
that Pillsbury owns a portion of the
 
00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:56.539 align:start position:0%
rail trail Corridor that is true
 
00:19:59.150 --> 00:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
Pillsbury owns about a five acre chunk
 
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
of the trail north of shields Brook
 
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
where this debate is occurring north of
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
this tunnel concept area pillsbury's
 
00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:09.539 align:start position:0%
chunk is in Londonderry and it's
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
privately owned the chunk is necessary
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
to connect the trail
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
a trail with The Gap isn't a trail
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's two trails with a hole in the
 
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.750 align:start position:0%
that's two trails with a hole in the
middle

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
middle
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
Pillsbury has repeatedly pledged to open
 
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
its connecting piece to public use
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh we're presently talking with the
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
Londonderry Trail group I understand to
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
be different group than the Derry Trail
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
group about a license to the town of
 
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
Londonderry for the public to use
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
maintain this portion of trail on
 
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
private land
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
the trail is a wonderful Community
 
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.100 align:start position:0%
amenity it's going to be enjoyed by many
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
enhance the Woodmont project as much as
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
anything and we're in support
 
00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:57.539 align:start position:0%
we are not in support of delay and we
 
00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
are not in support of changing designs
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
whether they were the original design or
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
the next design or the one after that
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
were not in favor of anything that
 
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
causes more delays because we can tell
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
you that dot is waiting their pencil is
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
down they need some direction now that
 
00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:18.299 align:start position:0%
all of this has been fluffed up and
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
those delays have real consequences and
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
I can share with you every story if you
 
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
ever wanted to hear them the the
 
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
conversation ends the same let us know
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
when the road is done
 
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
Pillsbury has no dog in the design fight
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
we understand both sides we appreciate
 
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
that safety is a priority for everyone
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
who has a dog in that fight those are
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
the best of reasons we know that dot
 
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
prioritizes safety and we know that you
 
00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
know that we know dot has the state's
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
Authority and best interests in mind
 
00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
when they build roads when they design
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
roads and when they go through the
 
00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
10-year process and public stakeholder
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
process to propose roads put them out to
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
bid construct them and maintain them we
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
know simply put that when the state
 
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
wants to build the road it calls Dot
 
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:10.580 align:start position:0%
so it's our view
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
that dot should be allowed to finish
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
what they've started and that frankly a
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
bill that started with criminal
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
implications and I recognize that's been
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
amended out but a bill that started with
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
criminal implications gave this whole
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
debate a very odd and different flavor
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
and if it was really just about how do
 
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
you design a passage that's safe for The
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
Pedestrian and bicyclist Community I
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
think this committee might have just
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
said we don't even know why we have this
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill and we're not we're not in the
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
business of Designing roads tunnels or
 
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.409 align:start position:0%
business of Designing roads tunnels or
Bridges

00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:47.419 align:start position:0%
Bridges
 
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
I don't know how dot could do its job
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
with criminal implications hanging over
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
their head I don't know how I could do
 
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
my job with criminal implications
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
hanging over my head we supp we we
 
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
support itl on this bill not because we
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
have a dog in the fight but we have a
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
dog in the fight of delay and D.O.T
 
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
needs a clear signal from this state
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
house to pick up their pencil finished
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
their work finish the road and put those
 
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
opportunities on the ground so that
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
these development Partners can come in
 
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
invest in New Hampshire provide the jobs
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
that I know will be uses that are
 
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
popular in the communities and anything
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
less than that will cause more delay in
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
the consequences of delay are real I
 
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate you taking the time I know
 
00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:36.299 align:start position:0%
you've had more than enough thank you
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.149 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
representable

00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
representable
 
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
for coming I think it's good to hear
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
from the business community in a greater
 
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:48.020 align:start position:0%
extent about the about
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
this issue I don't know if you can
 
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
answer this question but do you have a
 
00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:57.380 align:start position:0%
sense of the attitude of the broader
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
business Community with respect to the
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
delay that this bill's passage might
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
cause I I've heard it in many many
 
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
places over the years that the delays
 
00:24:14.649 --> 00:24:14.659 align:start position:0%
associated with the 4A project are
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
just depressing upsetting causing real
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
concern causing other businesses to hold
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
back on investment this
 
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:27.299 align:start position:0%
exit project and I'm not speaking
 
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
specifically to the rail trail or
 
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
bicycling design and I'm not an expert
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
on any of those subjects but I can tell
 
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
you that if you have a property you
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
don't have a road to you can't develop
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
it and this exit project has been lauded
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
for decades as opening up a tremendous
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity in that region of the state
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
further question representative both
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
seeing none thanks for appreciate the
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
so I have been in communication with the
 
00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:04.700 align:start position:0%
D.O.T commissioner
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
he regrets that there's been any
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
perception that his correspondence with
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
anyone in the group was uh appeared as
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
threatening and he reiterated he wants
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
to see this work forward and that um
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
he puts his hand out to work with the
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
community to make sure everything is
 
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
done and wanted me to remind
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
everybody here that whatever happens it
 
00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
will be the complete responsibility of
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy to maintain what is
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
ever left after the D.O.T is finished
 
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
with the project so one of get the
 
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
yes the good representative from Epping
 
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
right Epsom I'm getting there trying to
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
think I'd like to ask uh Ms Johnson some
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely yeah
 
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
and again if you could please State your
 
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is David rodrigue
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm the assistant commissioner for
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
my name is Wendy Johnson I'm the I'm the
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
project manager for the exit 4A project
 
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
nhdot thank you so um representative
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
Pearson just said that the this project
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
could somehow affect Wetlands is that
 
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.269 align:start position:0%
could somehow affect Wetlands is that
true

00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
there are wetlands impacted for the for
 
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
the entire project and whether we go
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
with the bridge option with the tunnel
 
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
underneath the roadway or if we go with
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
a Shields broke option there are both
 
00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:46.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
is some somehow worse than the other or
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
different or I mean what is it there's
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's slightly more Wetlands impacts
 
00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
with the one on Shields Brook as we
 
00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
currently have it designed we're still
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
working on refining the total design but
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's on the order of about 60 extra
 
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
square feet
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
would there be any Wetlands impact of
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
so so not doing a tunnel or an underpass
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
yes there would be no additional impacts
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
with that option no okay yes so um I'm
 
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
familiar with Keith Coda who was had
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
your job before you did and
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
um he explained to me some of the
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
history is related to the difference
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
between the design build process and the
 
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
design bid build process can you explain
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
what happened here in that regard yeah
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
perfect so when we start to do a design
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
we get to a point where we're getting
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
ready to go to a hearing that's about
 
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
our 25 design stage and at that point we
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
make a decision of whether we're going
 
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
to design it in-house get everything all
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
together put together a bid package
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
solicit it for bids and then have a
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
contractor build it so that's a regular
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
that's the standard process the standard
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
procurement you would usually see the
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
second way that we can do it or there's
 
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
actually three ways but the second way
 
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
that we look at most often is a design
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
is a design build and in that case we
 
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
get to that same 25 design we go to the
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
we go to the public hearing and then we
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
step back and we send the whole thing
 
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
out to be advertised so they come up
 
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
with uh the design they do all their
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
right-of-way Acquisitions they do all of
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
that stuff which would usually happen in
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
our design window so the contractor and
 
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
the cons and a consultant team up
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
together and they do the whole project
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
right from that point and so when they
 
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.210 align:start position:0%
right from that point and so when they
do

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
um these design build projects they're
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
given you know there's they weight each
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
portion of how the the design is done by
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
who can who can do at least expensively
 
00:28:45.409 --> 00:28:45.419 align:start position:0%
who can do it faster and so they're
 
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
incentivized to come up with ways that
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
could improve the design and those are
 
00:28:51.769 --> 00:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
called alternative technical Concepts
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
these are those atcs that everybody's
 
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
been talking about and the trail was one
 
00:28:58.850 --> 00:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
one of those atcs
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
so why was this design build process
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
used in this case when what I understand
 
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
from him is design bid build is more
 
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.930 align:start position:0%
from him is design bid build is more
common

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
common
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
so design bid build is more common and
 
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
the reason that we tried to go with the
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
other way is a lot of times you can save
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of time going in that route
 
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
because you're designing and building at
 
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
the same exact time so right now we have
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
to go through a couple years to design
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
it and then we put it out to build and
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
everything is all set when you combine
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
the designing and the building all at
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
the same time you can be working on your
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
right-of-way negotiations while you're
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
relocating some utilities while you're
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
doing all that stuff and it doesn't have
 
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
to wait until you have a Contractor on
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
board so sometimes you can get it you
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
can get the design on the road more
 
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.490 align:start position:0%
can get the design on the road more
quickly

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
yeah so let's talk about grade level
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
crossing because to me
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
I've how many streets do you see that
 
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
have tunnels right next to none
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
um is there something special I went out
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
to this location there's nothing there
 
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
right it's a bit it's in the middle of
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
nowhere it leads to you know a trail in
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
the middle of the woods Etc
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
is there something special about this
 
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
location that that somehow zillions of
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
people are going to be Crossing and
 
00:30:16.269 --> 00:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
going through it
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
by comparison to if I were to walk to
 
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
Holiday Inn here I crossed a six five or
 
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
six Lane Road very busy
 
00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:27.539 align:start position:0%
on the street right with a walk light
 
00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
why why does this location somehow weird
 
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
that it needs something else compared to
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
its crosswalk
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question so when they
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
were doing all that initial design that
 
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
beginning part before the hearing when
 
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
Keith was working on the project they go
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
out to the public and they gain
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
different pieces of information and they
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
go to the natural resource agencies and
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
they get counts and they try to project
 
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:51.299 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen
 
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
during that phase of the design they
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
decided that we would offer a grade
 
00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
separated alternative to the at grade at
 
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
to the ad grade crossing we never the
 
00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
documents don't say it has to be a
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
tunnel it has to be this has to be that
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
it just says we agreed to a agreed
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
separated location simply because it
 
00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
made sense from uh the amount of vehicle
 
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I mean so do you think the
 
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:21.860 align:start position:0%
number of pedestrians in that location
 
00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
is somehow different than the number of
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
pedestrians greater than the number of
 
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
pedestrians on Main Street in Concord or
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
something like that you see what I mean
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
I I do hear what you're saying I don't
 
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
know the numbers in Concord but I can
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
say that the you know if you anecdotally
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
speaking just to the south of here
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of other Crossings of
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
similar type roads on the same exact
 
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
quarter that do not have a grade
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
separated Crossing you're correct
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
I'm searching my memory and my
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
the relevant topics on rail trails
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
most of these were when the railroad
 
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
could buy property pretty cheap because
 
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
it was mainly farmlands that was back
 
00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:09.539 align:start position:0%
before 1900
 
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
and they went directly from one
 
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
populated area to another with very
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
little in between so the property was
 
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
reasonably cheap
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
way before any of us were on this
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
committee the state realized the value
 
00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:24.059 align:start position:0%
of these straight-line
 
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
things that would be very difficult to
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
obtain later on as the property values
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
went up so they required whenever the
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
the railroad abandoned one it went to
 
00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
now one of the things I discovered many
 
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
years ago we were looking at a proposed
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
rail trail crossover of a road maybe
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
maybe it was a stream but the point was
 
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
that the bridge over it was going to
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
cost twice as much as as we thought it
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
should have and we said why is it
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
so strong and so on the answer was this
 
00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.570 align:start position:0%
so strong and so on the answer was this
well

00:32:59.570 --> 00:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
the phone company or the cable company
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
runs cables down the railroads right
 
00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
away because they're so direct they
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to hassle with 100 landowners
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
they just
 
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
get a lease from the from the railroad
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
and now they've got a straight line
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
going from one place to another
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I said so
 
00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
do we get paid by the cable company for
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
this oh no
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
who gets paid for it the railroad well
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
the railroad doesn't own it anymore
 
00:33:30.169 --> 00:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
well they offered us when they sold us
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
the right-of-way
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
to buy that lease and we said no we
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
can't afford it
 
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
so we still have to maintain the cables
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
going down the railroad right away
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
and they get paid for them the railroad
 
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
it also occurs to me that these straight
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
line things are so valuable it's such a
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
valuable asset to the state and now
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
recently we're hearing about today water
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
and we keep hearing in Rockingham County
 
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
they want more water some of it they
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
want to get from Manchester and
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
Pentucket now it would seem the ideal
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
way to run a water line would also be as
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
straight as possible and that might be a
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
possibility for a railroad right away
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
but it would want to be straight
 
00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
as possible and as direct as possible
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
and I think it's something that maybe we
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
should look at when we're considering
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
spreading water lines around the state
 
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:24.419 align:start position:0%
we should look at railroad right-of-ways
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
which we own it would make it so much
 
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
easier especially if the state is making
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
a major contribution so my question is
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
that I finally getting to is does DOT
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
have a cable right away down this
 
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
railroad right away that
 
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
you know of do you know that there's any
 
00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
telephone cables or whatever cables
 
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
going down this right away that the
 
00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
state is receiving money for
 
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question a little
 
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
further explanation about what you
 
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
described for this particular portion of
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
what was referred to as I believe the
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester Lawrence Branch but please
 
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
yes the Manchester Lawrence branch of
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
the rail right-of-way
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
that right of way was largely dissolved
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
in this area in 1985 and in 1986.
 
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:24.740 align:start position:0%
directly south of this exit 4A project
 
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
the town of Derry purchased that
 
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
right-of-way from the Manchester
 
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
Lawrence and I testified to this last
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
time if you look at where the the rail
 
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
trail now runs through the town of Derry
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's concurrent with some side streets
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's directly adjacent to buildings and
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
it's through some parking lots so I
 
00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:50.339 align:start position:0%
think when they look at where they run
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
the water line they put it down Route 28
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
because that was a much more direct
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
route than it would be to go through the
 
00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.950 align:start position:0%
route than it would be to go through the
community

00:35:59.950 --> 00:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
furthermore the the northern section of
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
this rail trail that's directly
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
underneath our project area was was
 
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
purchased by a private entity and the
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
state no longer has an interest in it
 
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
with respect to right-of-ways there is a
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
fiber optic line that runs underneath
 
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
that that right-of-way and is and is
 
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
accommodated but I'll tell you when we
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
get into talking about the amendment the
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
way the amendment is is written we have
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
some very serious concerns because right
 
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
now North High Street is designed to be
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
constructed directly over this entire
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
railroad right-of-way Corridor and if we
 
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
have to follow the terms of this
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
amendment we'll have to relocate the
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
North High Street design which we're
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
talking about a very major design change
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
at this point in the project
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
I know there are other complications and
 
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
and I can't believe the state didn't
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
move right in when this was abandoned in
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
85 like they had in all the others why
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
did I screw that up I'm sorry I wasn't
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
here in 1985 I can't tell yeah somebody
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's long dead probably on that
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
decision but it's one of the greatest
 
00:37:22.609 --> 00:37:22.619 align:start position:0%
reasons why we always grab a
 
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
a railroad right away because it's so
 
00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
difficult to get it right away in
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
today's market I can tell you in 19 I
 
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
and I have the dates here for for the
 
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
right away so if you'll if you'll bear
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
with me in 1985 when the portion was
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
sold to the town of Derry the state did
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
maintain that that that be held as a
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
transportation right-of-way for the
 
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
future so we have it on that piece
 
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
somehow we missed it on on this piece
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
between that Northern Terminus and the
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
town of London there and now it gives us
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
problems so there is in fact a fiber
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
optic cable running along this right
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
away there is in fact the fiber optic
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
cable running in that right away how are
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
you going to accommodate it with this
 
00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:11.329 align:start position:0%
you going to accommodate it with this
design

00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:11.339 align:start position:0%
design
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
our Wendy provide the details
 
00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:17.099 align:start position:0%
so the fiber optic line is if you look
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
at the plan um High Street is is here
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
the fiber optic line is slightly to the
 
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
right of that or to the east of that we
 
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
don't impact it with our current design
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
and it's also it's a little bit deeper
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
than you know like a water line might be
 
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's probably you know eight feet eight
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
feet deep so the design is Worth showing
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
it except for a couple of driveways
 
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't go near that fiber optic
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
line what if the tunnel went in how
 
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
would that affect it
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
so that would be a different scenario
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
although I did take a quick look at it
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
you know just the back of the enveloping
 
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
and I think it would we would be able to
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
to put something in with minimal impacts
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
to it but I think we would we would have
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
some sort of impact to it
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I just thought that question
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
up the other night thank you Mr chairman
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative while I did
 
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
notice the Do Not dig a t markers all
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
through there so
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
I guess I could confirm that there is
 
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
something there
 
00:39:14.349 --> 00:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Griffin
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative Peterson
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
when he testified earlier he said that
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
the bid package went out her proposal
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
whenever we call it then included the
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.750 align:start position:0%
whenever we call it then included the
tunnel

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
tunnel
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
all right and I'm interested in
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
how that
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
then created the
 
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:34.810 align:start position:0%
then created the
the

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:34.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
design and build concept
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
in other words the original build bid
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't a design bill
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
proposal was it
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
sure yeah the original package that went
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
out was the design the design bid design
 
00:39:59.569 --> 00:39:59.579 align:start position:0%
build so nothing was actually designed
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
it was like a concept on the plan sheet
 
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
so when they were looking at what they
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
could do to to you know to to make their
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
design better and and make some
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
improvements on it that's when they came
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
up with the alternative to remove the
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
tunnel save the time of constructing the
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
second the second structure reduced
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance move the structure to the
 
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
right so what happens is they do that
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
ATC which I was talking about that
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
alternative technical concept as we
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
didn't go with the design build process
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
what we end up doing is we end up having
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
to pay the the people uh stipend and
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
when we when we pay for the stipend we
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
get everything back that they had done
 
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:37.619 align:start position:0%
so we pay the stipend so now we own that
 
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
design and so the next part that we had
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
done once we had transitioned that
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
happened in the fall of was you know so
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
the fall had happened then we were going
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
to put the project back out for
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
um for solicitation to get the
 
00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:53.099 align:start position:0%
consultant on board to design it and
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
then build it so when we did that
 
00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:56.339 align:start position:0%
process we took a look at everything
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
that they had done and we had at that
 
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
point we had contacted
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
um the town and the town had us contact
 
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
UM the trail groups and at that point
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
they had said well this is this is
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
something we weren't supposed to talk
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
about and I said no we own these now
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to talk about them and
 
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
they had no objection at that point I
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
didn't say they agreed they had no
 
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.630 align:start position:0%
didn't say they agreed they had no
objection

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
objection
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
um and so we brought that back at that
 
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.510 align:start position:0%
um and so we brought that back at that
point

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
um to the town we said they have no
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
objections we went back and forth and
 
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's when we went forward and I know
 
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
that he had read about the you know we
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
went back and forth and back and forth
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
and the there's one piece missing in
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
there that after we talked to the town
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
and we had um you know we told the town
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
that we were going to go in this
 
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
direction because we were trying to make
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
decisions quickly and move forward we
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
did end up having some conversations
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
with the town and then everybody had had
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
some some thoughts we did talk about it
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
sit down and talked about it and at that
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
point they said yeah you know if we're
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
going to have to maintain these
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
structures and we're going to be
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
responsible the ultimate maintenance and
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
all of this in the future that we we
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to take on that second
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
structure if it's going to be our
 
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
structure we don't want to take on that
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
structure so that's how we got from the
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
Department saying you know we hope you
 
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
can we hope you can you can you can work
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
with us on this to them actually coming
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
around to say yeah now that we think
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
about it we really we really don't want
 
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
it and then that's how we ended up at
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
that location did I did I answer what
 
00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:16.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
this is more common than a question but
 
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
if we had known I think if we had known
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
the bidding process if it had been made
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
clear To Us by the Department of
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
Transportation I know what you two
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
people were not at the original meeting
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
but nobody made clear that that was the
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
type bid that was sent out that it was a
 
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
design Bill and that you're looking for
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
that type proposal and I think it would
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
have saved us hours
 
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr yes I was just going to say
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
there's been plenty of discussion on the
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
matter but yes go ahead sir
 
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to that point
 
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
particular we were here at the first
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and we were ready to to testify
 
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:13.140 align:start position:0%
to that and I just to to clarify we keep
 
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
referring to this or not we this has
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
often been referred to as a rail trail
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
project or a tunnel project what the
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation is building
 
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
is the exit 4A project that constructs a
 
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
new exit on the interstate and connects
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
that exit and Recon builds a new road
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
and reconstructs Roads existing roads
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
through Dairy to connect I-93 to Route
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
102. this is a design element in the
 
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
project so it is very important to us
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
all design elements are very important
 
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
to us but in the big scheme of things
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
this is a very small piece of the
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
project the design build projects as
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
Wendy had testified they were progressed
 
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
to 25 percent it is not uncommon for
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
these Design Elements to change during
 
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
the progression of of the project and
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
very much as representative Maguire has
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
has talked about the crossing at the
 
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
signalized intersection using the walk
 
00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:25.140 align:start position:0%
don't walk button the bottom line with
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
all of these options cross at the signal
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
cross at the tunnel or cross under
 
00:44:34.089 --> 00:44:34.099 align:start position:0%
Shields Brook is there a pros and cons
 
00:44:38.089 --> 00:44:38.099 align:start position:0%
advantages and disadvantages to each
 
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
option and the department works works
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
hard to weigh those and come out with
 
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
the best option what we believe the best
 
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
option with the communities that we're
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
building that and considering Public
 
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
public input do we always get it right
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
for all the people it's impossible to
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
when the op options range from pushing
 
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
the button and everybody having to wait
 
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
for a walk cycle to a path under Shields
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
I accept all that you said I understand
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
that what I'm trying to point out is
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
that had we known more early on it would
 
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
have been very helpful when as know more
 
00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
about the bidding process early on and
 
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
that it was in fact a design build
 
00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:36.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
second your comments there because we've
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
spent an awful lot of time on this and
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
if perhaps we'd gotten all the
 
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
information in the front end versus
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
10 hours later would have been helpful
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
but it is what it is and we'll try to
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
I guess a follow-up to representative
 
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
McGuire's question that's the problem
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
when you ask questions you can get other
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
questions but he referenced you know
 
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
someone Crossing Main Street which I
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
think has got a posted speed limit of
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps 20 25 miles an hour the speed on
 
00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
this I'm sure is going to be what 40 or
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
more is it what is your speed design
 
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be a a connector
 
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
road to the interstate
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
it is going to be a connector Road and I
 
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
I apologize I should know that off the
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
top of my head but I believe it is going
 
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
to be around the 40 mile an hour range
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
but I can get back to the committee with
 
00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:31.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
we'll go with representative Hewitt and
 
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
going over all of this stuff I noticed
 
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.630 align:start position:0%
going over all of this stuff I noticed
that

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:44.329 --> 00:46:44.339 align:start position:0%
there is a environmental impact
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
statement accompanying this project
 
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
appears to have been done around 2015 or
 
00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
something like that I've I've got it
 
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
right here somewhere
 
00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.349 align:start position:0%
right here somewhere
um

00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
the question I have is at the time the
 
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
environmental impact statement was made
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
didn't was there that had to be I guess
 
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
was there actually a plan
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
in some something that that
 
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
caused the environmental impact
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
statement to be taken up by the by the
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:17.270 align:start position:0%
federal government
um

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.329 align:start position:0%
um
would

00:47:19.329 --> 00:47:19.339 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:23.579 align:start position:0%
the the plan that's uh that's included
 
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
in this legislation
 
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
require any changes to the environmental
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a very good question so
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
the environmental impact statement is
 
00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
always done prior to the time that we go
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
to the public hearing so that's going to
 
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:44.579 align:start position:0%
be about that 25 design time so we don't
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
know exactly what we're going to be
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
doing because designs get refined as you
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
keep designing the project all along
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
and so what happens is prior to
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
advertising the project we would go and
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
we would formalize what our official and
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
final impacts would be and that's when
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
we would apply back to the you know
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
nhdes Army Corps of Engineers to get the
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
actual permits so in that particular
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
case we we are in still in line with
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
everything that was impacted previously
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
so if we change any major element like
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
in this particular case if we went to
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
the tunnel to the crossing under Shields
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
Brook although it still has the same
 
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
utility we would have to apply for
 
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
something called a niba reevaluation so
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
it goes back and takes a look at that
 
00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
what did we change and what does it
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
impact you know are there a lot more
 
00:48:32.089 --> 00:48:32.099 align:start position:0%
Wetlands impacts or whatnot and we're in
 
00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
the process of doing that for this for
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
this project
 
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
okay and in connection with all this
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
back several years ago uh the town and
 
00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
the department of trans station and also
 
00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:47.900 align:start position:0%
the town was what's the other Town
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
Londonderry and Londonderry and dairy
 
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
and into a contract uh with the
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation uh
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
got governing a lot of this stuff
 
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.390 align:start position:0%
got governing a lot of this stuff
um

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
and suggesting what was going to be done
 
00:49:08.329 --> 00:49:08.339 align:start position:0%
and bringing up the issue that the towns
 
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
of the Londonderry and dairy were not
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
going to incur any further expense
 
00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
beyond the five million dollars that was
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
originally included in the contract and
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
this contract uh was at the time it was
 
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
signed by both parties and also approved
 
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
by the Attorney General uh is that is
 
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
that would that would anything that's
 
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question so I believe
 
00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
we did talk about this last week as as
 
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
well the the municipal agreement stated
 
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
what both communities Darien Londonderry
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
would do and what the Department of
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation would do to to finish
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
this project
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
the the department is very very familiar
 
00:49:59.210 --> 00:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
with the municipal agreement that that
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
one explains the the terms and there are
 
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
terms within the municipal agreement to
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
revisit cost should cost an increase and
 
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
if you'd like me to to take a minute I
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
can read those sections from the
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
municipal agreement for you
 
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
you can yeah it would be good to have
 
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.089 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:29.099 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
and that agreement makes it clear that
 
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
anything in excess I believe of the five
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars from either Community
 
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
will be borne by the state or others is
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that I I do think if the
 
00:50:46.849 --> 00:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
state provided it and the department and
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
it came through the department I don't
 
00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:50.579 align:start position:0%
see where that would be an issue if
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:56.089 --> 00:50:56.099 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney you had a
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much chairman I
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here again I'll try
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
to be as quick as possible so you had
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think in your answer to
 
00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin that this is the
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
exit 4A plan this isn't you know the
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
whole project is not for the rail trail
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to to
 
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
grapple in my mind
 
00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
is why is it not Road first Trail second
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
on the construction schedule why is it
 
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
so intermixed where if we were to go
 
00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:26.339 align:start position:0%
with the tunnel plan or one other plan
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
it would cause such a drastic delay in
 
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
the development of getting exit 4A open
 
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
if can we not
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
get that access road complete without
 
00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:39.980 align:start position:0%
tackling the rail trail concurrently or
 
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
what yeah that's basically it because if
 
00:51:47.329 --> 00:51:47.339 align:start position:0%
if we skipped over the whole tunnel and
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
in in the in the um the combination of
 
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
the structure we're still going to build
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
shieldsbruck but if we had to come back
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
and put a tunnel in underneath we'd have
 
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
to rip up everything that we had already
 
00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
just built so it wouldn't you would be
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
losing money and you'd be losing time
 
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
because then you have to design that
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
again and fix figure out how you're
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
going to match it all in and then come
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
back and do it so this design and then
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
the other component would be is if we we
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
put a pause on the tunnel and then we
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
come back and do the tunnel later then
 
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
all of those right-of-way properties
 
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
that we would have purchased we have to
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
go back into it again and so we need to
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
know we need to know which way we're
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
going to be designing the whole thing
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
because that's how we approach the whole
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
design before we can in the same thing
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
for like Wetlands permitting and all
 
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing we want to apply once
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
because the amount of wetlands impacts
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
we have depends on what our mitigation
 
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
is and if we don't need extra mitigation
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be paying those upfront
 
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
costs either if that makes sense
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to be buying the division
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
that uh chair Weiler and
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
the good representative from Epson
 
00:52:49.559 --> 00:52:51.849 align:start position:0%
the good representative from Epson
foreign

00:52:51.849 --> 00:52:51.859 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:54.059 align:start position:0%
need to get out of here shortly for
 
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
another hearing representative evil
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here this is really
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
difficult because there's there's so
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
many facts to come in that we're trying
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
to learn and absorb and retain as we try
 
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
to make a judgment so I frequently will
 
00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:13.460 align:start position:0%
just track back to Derry and that final
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
decision that we had from the Town
 
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
Council where they said that they were
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
just going to leave things the way they
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
were because they didn't want to incur
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
additional cost and they didn't want to
 
00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:29.099 align:start position:0%
incur additional DeLay So I've been if
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
if the if we put this in the budget that
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
takes care of the cost part but it
 
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't really take care of the delay
 
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.069 align:start position:0%
doesn't really take care of the delay
part

00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:53:40.079 --> 00:53:42.650 align:start position:0%
part
so

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
I I just want to make sure as the
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
committee makes a decision that we fully
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
understand the ramifications of a
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
decision to retain and put it in the
 
00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
budget or pass it
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
I think that we have to remember to
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
build in whatever we do
 
00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:05.099 align:start position:0%
a bill has to get through the
 
00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
legislative process so that that's
 
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
several months I don't know what you
 
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
guys do in the meantime
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
and then once a decision is made so
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
let's say it goes in the budget and the
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
budget passes
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
um you know what gets picked up there
 
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
so that's my question I just the the
 
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
other part of this is though that we
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
can't forget that monies have already
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
been expended in pursuing the existing
 
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.950 align:start position:0%
been expended in pursuing the existing
plan

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
which are based largely lost
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I I'm just trying I just want
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure we focus as much on the
 
00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
delay issue we've heard from a
 
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
representative of the business Community
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
um and try not to think quite as much
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
about the financial part
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:55.730 align:start position:0%
about the financial part
yep

00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your question so
 
00:55:04.089 --> 00:55:04.099 align:start position:0%
um you you described the the process
 
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
exactly and the way I I'll address this
 
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%
is to talk about risk when we look at in
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
an entire project we talk about risk
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
there's Financial Risk and there's risk
 
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
due to time as well and of course as
 
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot of testimony about
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
different designs posts different risks
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
to Transportation users at the end of
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
but but what a bill like this does at
 
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
this point in our design we are working
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
full speed to deliver this this project
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
as quickly as we can our commissioner at
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
most every executive council meeting is
 
00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
asked by the counselors house foray
 
00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
going wins 4A going to to be done we we
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
have been pushing towards design and and
 
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
delivery of this this project
 
00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
to an extent this whole discussion has
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
interfered with with our ability to
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
continue the design with confidence
 
00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
right because we don't know what this
 
00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:20.339 align:start position:0%
final element is is going to be we are
 
00:56:23.089 --> 00:56:23.099 align:start position:0%
moving forward on the things that we can
 
00:56:27.049 --> 00:56:27.059 align:start position:0%
but as we talked about last time when
 
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
will this bill
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
be passed when will it be signed by the
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
governor I went through a list a partial
 
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
lists of 16 steps that we would have to
 
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
go through which includes in an
 
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
amendment that would then need to be
 
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
approved by the governor and Council
 
00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
another legislative body for us to to
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
move forward and implement this change
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
so the delays are very very real we
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
expect if we continue on our current
 
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
course we will see construction of this
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
project out there next year 2024 if we
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
change course and go to the the tunnel
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
design traffic will be or construction
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
stock will be delayed till 2025.
 
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
with we a representative why you have a
 
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
question represent Kimbrell's
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair I could just be permitted
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
for just a very quick question
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and
 
00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler have to run but
 
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
yeah very quickly yeah yeah yes he does
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
just just a quick theoretical question
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
if we were to kill this bill and not
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
provide the funding and the town of
 
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
Derry were to write you a check to cover
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
all the costs to do the tunnel project
 
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
would you be compelled to build a tunnel
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
or would you still hold ground that um
 
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
that it's not worth it because of the
 
00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.390 align:start position:0%
that it's not worth it because of the
delays

00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
delays
 
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
so what the Town Council has been clear
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
on in a bowl is they want no delays the
 
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
the Town Council
 
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:09.250 align:start position:0%
the Town Council
ex

00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:09.260 align:start position:0%
ex
 
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
hold on please we need to really move
 
00:58:14.049 --> 00:58:14.059 align:start position:0%
this along I I
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
recognize your passion but in all due
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
respect and I'm going through all these
 
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
records and I see this has been going on
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
since 1985 and we're still here we
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be here this shouldn't be
 
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
before our division to be quite candid
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
with you but
 
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:30.589 align:start position:0%
with you but
um

00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
I've seen the correspondence from
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
several town councils that disagree with
 
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
your interpretation of their vote I
 
00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
provided a copy of one of those letters
 
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner that and he
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
responded to that concern I think we
 
00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
really need to move on and my personal
 
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
thought is that we should put this in
 
00:58:54.049 --> 00:58:54.059 align:start position:0%
the budget it's a budget year and we'll
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
check with Mr Hoffman if that goes
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
forward to see how much we should add
 
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
with a 750 is adequate or more money but
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
that's my position representative Weiler
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
I moved to retain because as you say
 
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
we'll put this in the bill I'll put this
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
in the in the budget we'll have longer
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
discussions with DOT we can urge them to
 
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
move this up and their priorities and
 
00:59:18.289 --> 00:59:18.299 align:start position:0%
obviously from what has been said even
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill it's still going to
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
be a year before anything starts
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
if we retain it put it in the bill hit
 
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
further discussions with Dot and say
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
Here's what we're putting in the budget
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
here's what we want to happen and
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
that'll be over in in division two but
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
those of us that have sat in on this can
 
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
go over and and share the history with
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
them you and I with once we have
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
conversations with every day in division
 
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
two as well and tell them what we want
 
00:59:47.089 --> 00:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
to happen and that way maybe we have a
 
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
little more pressure on the dot so I
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
moved to retain I think in the motion
 
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
the motion's been made and seconded by
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
representing cambrell's if the clerk is
 
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
we have way too much paper and we
 
01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
Maguire absent
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
to retain the ball to retain
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%

bills retained thank you Mr Clerk and we
 
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
will be in touch as this moves forward
