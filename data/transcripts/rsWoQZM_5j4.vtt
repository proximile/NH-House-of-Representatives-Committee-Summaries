00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
it is a minute or so after 10 o'clock so
 
00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
this is what uh representative colcum if
 
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you everyone for joining
 
00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
our first
 
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
labor public hearings of the year a
 
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
couple things before we get started
 
00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 align:start position:0%
particularly for the new people it has
 
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
been the practice for as long as I've
 
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
been on this committee that when we have
 
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
members who are sponsoring or
 
00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
co-sponsoring a bill which we have a
 
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
number of today that those members who
 
00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
wish to testify recuse themselves from
 
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
their seat and participate on that bill
 
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
from the audience
 
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
um members who are co-sponsors who do
 
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
not testify are free to remain in their
 
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
seats but we generally do not
 
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
ask questions and interact on a bill on
 
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
which we have sponsored I think it can
 
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
be intimidating if we're giving the
 
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
perception that we get to play both
 
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
sides of the table
 
00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
um kind of in a similar way be please be
 
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
respectful of the people testifying
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's necessary to go in and
 
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 align:start position:0%
out of the committee room
 
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly but uh I I think if you can
 
00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 align:start position:0%
please refrain from moving about while
 
00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 align:start position:0%
somebody is in the middle of testimony
 
00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
if you can wait until they've completed
 
00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.509 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
remind everyone we are on being live
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
streamed so please make use of the
 
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 align:start position:0%
microphones so that it gets picked up
 
00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.070 align:start position:0%
microphones so that it gets picked up
and

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh our chairman will be watching us via
 
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
live stream as is I understand his
 
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 align:start position:0%

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.009 align:start position:0%
mother so please let's conduct ourselves
accordingly

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
yes we do have a pretty full schedule
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
today it was in some part unavoidable
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
that we have a lot of bills that are
 
00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
early bills that need to be reported in
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
early so we might have one or two more
 
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.009 align:start position:0%
early so we might have one or two more
than

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:04.729 align:start position:0%
than
um

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
I would often
 
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
be comfortable with within the time
 
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
frame so I would ask everyone both on
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
if most people have put down the time
 
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
that they're going to speak I'd ask you
 
00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 align:start position:0%
to try to stick to that
 
00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.090 align:start position:0%

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
speechifying stuff so to speak now I
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
just want to talk about the specifics of
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the bill to just
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
explain the language and what it is
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
and introduce it in the formal sense all
 
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
right go ahead and do that plan on
 
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
introduction and then you can come back
 
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
did you fill out a card
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%

you thank you okay without further Ado
 
00:07:59.809 --> 00:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
um and there are X there were anyways
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
extra copies of the amendment on the
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
table for folks who are here
 
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
um the amendment simplifies the bill
 
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
it keeps to them to adding changes and
 
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
introducing a minimum wage back to New
 
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:15.950 align:start position:0%
introducing a minimum wage back to New
Hampshire

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
it is in three steps uh 13.50
 
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
which would be in effect in September
 
00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:28.379 align:start position:0%
then 14 25 on January 1st of next year
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
then fifteen dollars the subsequent year
 
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
and then every January 1st after that so
 
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
from 2026 there would be a cola based on
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor Statistics
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
average for Northeast Consumer Price
 
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.530 align:start position:0%
average for Northeast Consumer Price
Index

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
Index
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
um because that seems the first thing to
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
do including if you think about
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
inflation today that means everyone's
 
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
dollar goes not very far but it would be
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
nice to be able to do that for folks who
 
00:08:59.570 --> 00:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
are working hard to keep the Granite
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
State uh running
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
at one level or another
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
so it gets rid of the sections that
 
00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:07.610 align:start position:0%
so it gets rid of the sections that
um

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
section two which talks about the sub
 
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
minimum wage that's not needed because
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's a separate bill coming up next
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
and then it gets rid of a Teenage
 
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
training wage
 
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
so really the amendment is simply
 
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
the pay pay items
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
thank you okay is that all now yes thank
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you since we're
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to wipe down the microphone
 
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
next up I'd like to call Representative
 
00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
Kathy Staub speaking in support of the
 
00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:55.670 align:start position:0%
Kathy Staub speaking in support of the
bill

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
testimony for the record my name is
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
Kathy Staub I live in Ward 5 in
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire and represent
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County District 25.
 
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here to speak in favor of
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 57 which would raise New
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's well repo re reintroduce a
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
minimum wage statute to the state of New
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and raise the wage from 7.25
 
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
cents an hour to two to Fifteen dollars
 
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
in 2025.
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the last time New Hampshire raised
 
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage was 2009.
 
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
um the federal minimum wage went up to
 
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
725 in 2010 New Hampshire's minimum wage
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
was 7.25 in 2009.
 
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
um at that time our minimum wage was
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
closely in line with other New England
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
states the highest minimum wage in New
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
England at that point was eight dollars
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
and 25 cents an hour so we were at 7.25
 
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:29.339 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was at eight so it was all
 
00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:30.350 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was at eight so it was all
fairly

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
um fairly close times have changed
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
um costs have gone up
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
workers have
 
00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:43.339 align:start position:0%
required more money from their employers
 
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
and so at this point
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
um the minimum wage in Maine is 13.80
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
cents an hour in Massachusetts it is 15
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
an hour at Rhode Island is 13. Vermont
 
00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
is 13.18 and Connecticut will be going
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
to 15 on June 1st of this year and New
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire remains at 7.25 cents an hour
 
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.670 align:start position:0%
Hampshire remains at 7.25 cents an hour
and

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
um some people will say well nobody
 
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
makes that well some people do but it
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
also sends a powerful message to workers
 
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
that the elected government the people
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
who are elected to
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
um to serve the people of New Hampshire
 
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
really don't
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
um think much about
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
um working people so I think it sends a
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
powerful message I think it would be a
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
very important step to take to attract
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
and retain workers to the state
 
00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:40.019 align:start position:0%
especially young workers
 
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
2010 30 states require employers to pay
 
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
more than the federal minimum wage of
 
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:51.260 align:start position:0%
7.25 cents an hour
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
this year alone 23 States raise their
 
00:12:56.769 --> 00:12:56.779 align:start position:0%
minimum wage several States Florida
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts California Washington
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
State and the District of Columbia
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
um our Entre well let's see
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts California Washington
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
State and the District of Columbia have
 
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
already reached 15 an hour several other
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
states are on track to 15 in the next
 
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
few years one being Florida which will
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
um in 2026 hit 15 Delaware in 2025
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
Illinois New Jersey Nebraska Florida and
 
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:27.980 align:start position:0%
Nebraska are both past minimum wage
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
ballot initiatives the last time a
 
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
ballot initiative to raise the minimum
 
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
wage failed was in 1996. this is a very
 
00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.230 align:start position:0%
wage failed was in 1996. this is a very
popular

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
popular
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation in 2019 there was a
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
public policy polling survey that
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
indicated that 79 percent of people in
 
00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
this voters in the state were in favor
 
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
of raising the minimum wage to
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
um twelve dollars an hour and 63 percent
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
were in favor of raising the minimum
 
00:13:59.810 --> 00:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
wage to Fifteen dollars an hour and that
 
00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339 align:start position:0%
was you know that was four years ago so
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
times have changed prices have gone up
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
and people recognize that working people
 
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
need to make a living wage
 
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
um speaking of the living wage
 
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.269 align:start position:0%
um speaking of the living wage
um

00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
according to the MIT calculator a single
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
person would need to make
 
00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:26.339 align:start position:0%
17.32 cents an hour to live a decent
 
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
life in New Hampshire a couple with one
 
00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
child both working would need to make
 
00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
18.56 an hour in a single person with
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
one child would need to make 33.91 cents
 
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:39.980 align:start position:0%
an hour in order to
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of themselves and their
 
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.910 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of themselves and their
family

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
I came here because you know I live in
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
Ward five
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot of hard-working people
 
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
in my ward who don't make a lot of money
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
because they're working in jobs like
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
grocery store cashier they're working in
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
nursing homes taking care of elderly and
 
00:15:04.569 --> 00:15:04.579 align:start position:0%
disabled people
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
they're very important to our
 
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.829 align:start position:0%
they're very important to our
um

00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
our economy in the city of Manchester
 
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
South Willow Street generates a lot of
 
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
of revenue for the for the state through
 
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.910 align:start position:0%
of revenue for the for the state through
uh

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
you know business tax profits taxes and
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
these people work really hard they
 
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
contribute to the the state and um they
 
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
deserve a decent quality of life and I
 
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
think that that's my main motivation I
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
know we're not supposed to talk about
 
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
motivation but my motivation in being a
 
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
state representative is to
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
um make sure that decent hard-working
 
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
people who live in my district have a
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
decent quality of life and that is why
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor of this bill and that's
 
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
why I'm in favor of passing a minimum
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
wage statute and and you know bringing
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire into the 21st century
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
um with and that's really all I have to
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
say I'm happy to take questions
 
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
for the representative yes
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
um will raising the minimum wage
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
cause job loss and increased
 
00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.430 align:start position:0%
cause job loss and increased
unemployment

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:25.189 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
um over the years I think Maine passed a
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
ballot initiative and their minimum wage
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
is very close to ours and when they did
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
raise their minimum wage there was no
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
job loss in fact there were a number of
 
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
new jobs added there was a study done in
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
Maine which I can email to the members
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
of the um I'll email a link to the
 
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:49.100 align:start position:0%
members of the committee if you like
 
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
also another indicator would be looking
 
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
at unemployment rates which I have
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
included in my data sheet New
 
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's current as of November of
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
2022 Ms McGraw from the Department of
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
Labor may have more recent statistics
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
but in 2022 November of 2022 New
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had a 2.6 unemployment rate
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
Connecticut with a close was it 4.2
 
00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
percent Maine at three
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts 3.4 Rhode Island 3.6
 
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
Vermont which has a much higher minimum
 
00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
wage of 13.00 18 cents an hour had a
 
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
lower unemployment rate than we did at
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
2.5 the only other state in the
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
Northeast with a 7.25 minute minimum
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
wage is Pennsylvania and their
 
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate is four percent
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
so um it you know it doesn't appear that
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
I'm raising the minimum wage has a
 
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
terrible impact on unemployment I will
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
say that many people believe that an
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate around three percent
 
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
indicates a labor shortage and you don't
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
need the statistics
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
to understand that yes indeed we do have
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
a labor shortage in the state of New
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so you know and I think
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
attracting more workers retaining more
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
workers you know people along the border
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
could be working in New Hampshire but
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
they can make you know if they're living
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
in Salem they can drive across the
 
00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299 align:start position:0%
border to Methuen and make a minimum of
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars an hour which you know
 
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
is not guaranteed here in New Hampshire
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
oh please thank you
 
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
um do you know how many people are
 
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
making under 15 an hour
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh yeah well it's
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
um the economic policy Institute in 2021
 
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
um believed I mean this is all a moving
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
Target we've seen that wages have been
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
going up and
 
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
um in an unprecedented way because of
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
this labor shortage that we have in 2021
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
the economic policy Institute estimated
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
that about 150 000 workers in the state
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire would benefit from a 15
 
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
minimum wage I am unsure if that number
 
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
is still accurate because that was over
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
a year ago and as I said it's a moving
 
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
Target they they believe that about 22
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
percent of the at that point 22 percent
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
of the entire Workforce of the state
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
would um
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
would benefit from a 15 an hour minimum
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
wage as of June of 22 the average entry
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
level wage was 14.32 cents an hour which
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
is close to 15. so if you were this bill
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
would raise the wage to 13.50
 
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
um in in 2023 uh in September and um you
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
know that wouldn't even hit that number
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that you need to
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
consider is that the distance between
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
seven dollars and 25 cents an hour and
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
that 14 an hour is is pretty small and
 
00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
and and and the other end of it
 
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
um you know people can be have a
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
starting wage in a job at thirty dollars
 
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
an hour and that that really skews it
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
high so there are probably a lot more
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
people who are making less than than in
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
terms of numbers making less than 14.36
 
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
an hour than there are people who are
 
00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh and yes if you could send that link
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
to the committee email I think we'd
 
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
appreciate that are there any other
 
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.169 align:start position:0%
appreciate that are there any other
questions

00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.770 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
testimonies

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
testimonies
 
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
next I would like to ask Maria Perez uh
 
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:42.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and good
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
morning members of the committee my name
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
is Maria Perez I'm a state
 
00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
representative from District 43 Milford
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of the bill now more
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
than ever is critical for us to
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
understand why we need to increase the
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
if we want to talk about
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
the crisis that we have housing crisis
 
00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
increase in the minimum wage is going to
 
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
help us
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of the people that we see homeless
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of the people that we see
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
suffering right now with mental health
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
is because it's hard it's hard for
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
people to work two to three jobs and
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
still not making enough to have a place
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
to live a place that can call home
 
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
it's hard for people to have family with
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
three or four kids and they still don't
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
have enough money to pay for food
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of kids to go to school
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
without having breakfast or lunch or
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
dinner because the parents they have to
 
00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
decide in between paying for the rent or
 
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059 align:start position:0%
paying for food in many cases paying for
 
00:22:06.059 --> 00:22:08.270 align:start position:0%
paying for food in many cases paying for
medication

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
medication
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
I heard a lot of comments and I hear a
 
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
lot of times people saying well we're
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
going to hurt businesses
 
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
businesses they're getting hurt right
 
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:18.830 align:start position:0%
businesses they're getting hurt right
now

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:21.539 align:start position:0%
because people decided not to work in
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
the industries what they get and pay
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
less than nine dollars an hour and they
 
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
move into industries that they can get
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
paid 15 to 20 dollars an hour
 
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
I have uh spoke to some businesses in my
 
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.730 align:start position:0%
I have uh spoke to some businesses in my
town

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
that they're having a hard time getting
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
people to work in the restaurant
 
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.230 align:start position:0%
people to work in the restaurant
industry

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to make
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
under 15 16 an hour
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
because they know that's not enough
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
if we talk about how much they have to
 
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
pay for rent
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
some of the apartments in 1750
 
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
1750 for one bedroom
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 22.50 for two
 
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
bedroom apartment
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
how in the world people gonna pay 22
 
00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a month in rent when
 
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
they're still making 7.25 nine dollars
 
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
an hour and please do not tell me that
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
people don't make 7.25 an hour because I
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
spoke to someone who worth 52 hours
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
and still make almost no money because
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
725 that's what she got paid
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm here in support because it is
 
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
time for us to
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
think about people as a humans
 
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
no money maker machines the industries
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
more Rich every day by the poor people
 
00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
I saw it on my own eyes the crisis that
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
we have right now with the homeless
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
population here in New Hampshire I was
 
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
there all day if we want to fix they
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
have the homeless situation and we want
 
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
to fix the mental health and other
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%

minimum wage thank you for your time and

I'm more than happy to take any
questions

questions

thank you representative for your
 
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:20.580 align:start position:0%

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
speaking for yourself yes thank you
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:45.539 align:start position:0%
members of the labor committee thank you
 
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
for listening to my testimony in support
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
of HB 57 I'm Claudia Estelle from New
 
00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:54.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Acworth New Hampshire sorry
 
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
um in my experience talking with voters
 
00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
about their concerns the economy is
 
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
often mentioned in discussing the
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
minimum wage there's often disbelief and
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
dismay that New Hampshire doesn't have a
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and relies on the federal
 
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
minimum wage of 7.25 cents an hour which
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
has not been raised since 2009 over 13
 
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539 align:start position:0%
years ago and during which time
 
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
inflation has increased by more than 24
 
00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.710 align:start position:0%
inflation has increased by more than 24
percent

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
with the labor market pressures these
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
voters are sure that no one still earns
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage however according to
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Labor Statistics 9 000 New
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire workers earned for 7.25 an
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
hour or less this is only 2.3 percent of
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Workforce but for
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
these workers the market forces are not
 
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.950 align:start position:0%
these workers the market forces are not
working

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
many workers earn more than the minimum
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
wage but still a hundred and fifty
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
thousand New Hampshire workers earn less
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
than fifteen dollars an hour that's
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
about 20 percent of the workforce or one
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
in five workers these workers are not
 
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
earning enough to cover basic needs of
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
housing food clothing Medical Care and
 
00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
transportation they are eligible for
 
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
Public Assistance programs these safety
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
net programs were designed to help
 
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
people in temporary and unusually
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunate circumstances not as a way
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
to make ends meet every month
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
these programs are paid for by taxpayers
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
like the workers who rely on them and
 
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
like all of us here and why are we
 
00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:21.299 align:start position:0%
subsidizing businesses so that they can
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
increase their profits
 
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
those I spoke with found these facts
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
concerning but countered with well if
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
wages go up prices will rise even more
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
hurting everyone
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
not so according to the economic policy
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
Institute they estimate that raising the
 
00:26:39.409 --> 00:26:39.419 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage to Fifteen dollars
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
an hour would Inc lift wages for 32
 
00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:45.419 align:start position:0%
million workers across the country at a
 
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
cost of 1
 
00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:52.340 align:start position:0%
108 billion dollars a huge sum but only
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
0.7 percent less than one percent of the
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
16 trillion dollars that U.S customers
 
00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
annually spend
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
they're consumers excuse me and so even
 
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
if the race was made in one year and
 
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
most bills including this one propose
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
incremental increases the effect on
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
prices would be less than one percent
 
00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
another comment was that workers who
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
want to improve their income can pursue
 
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
Education and Training for better paying
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
jobs many workers have done this
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
resulting in worker shortages and
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
essential jobs from Highway workers to
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
retail sales clerks to nursing
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
assistants from school bus drivers to
 
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:34.580 align:start position:0%
substitute teachers and
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals many states many find
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
the stress and lack of support in these
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
essential occupations combined with low
 
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
pay to be demoralizing stressful at all
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
on one's physical and mental health as
 
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
they constantly worry about making ends
 
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.110 align:start position:0%
they constantly worry about making ends

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
meet
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
the national employment law project and
 
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
the economic policy Institute found that
 
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
wages were below the cost of living in
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for the following
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
occupations weight staff fast food cooks
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
we need these people for our society to
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
function if we deem that they are
 
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
essential shouldn't we respect them with
 
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
a decent wage
 
00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419 align:start position:0%
inflation is a big concern now we can
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
all talk about how increases in price of
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
food electricity Fuel and other items of
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
wreak havoc with our budgets the people
 
00:28:39.769 --> 00:28:39.779 align:start position:0%
who are most affected are low-wage
 
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
workers who spend all their income on
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
essential items like food housing and
 
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:44.810 align:start position:0%
essential items like food housing and
energy

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
they can barely make ends meet in 2020
 
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
and use pandemic relief checks to cover
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
basic expenses now they are stretched
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
more stressed and suffering they're
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
relying even more on food pantries
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
Church relief funds and Public
 
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
Assistance programs
 
00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:04.580 align:start position:0%
as they spend all their income in local
 
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
stores and businesses they build and
 
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
strengthen our state state economy they
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
are also the ones most affected by
 
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
higher prices because so many of them
 
00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:16.340 align:start position:0%
work in retail and service jobs
 
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
consumers will first cut back on eating
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
out haircuts buying extras and low-wage
 
00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
workers in service and Retail will be
 
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
among the first to see their hours and
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
jobs cut
 
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
if we believe that everyone should be
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
able to stand up on their own two feet
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
then we should support paying workers
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
enough so that they can do that a living
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
wage in New Hampshire is at least 17 an
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
hour according to the MIT living wage
 
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
calculator so this bill is conservative
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
move in the right direction please
 
00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
support HB 57 to reinstate the minimum
 
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
wage in New Hampshire and raise it to 15
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
an hour by 2025. thank you thank you

00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
number of people making uh sub minimum
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:19.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the I I would assume
 
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
possibly because it said less than 27.25
 
00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
an hour but I haven't read the full
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
report carefully I have the the link to
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
it on my testimony okay thank you

next up I would like to ask the Reverend
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
Dr Gail Kinney
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%

00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
minutes of testimony and she represents
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire United Church of

00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
so good morning Mr chair and members of
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
the committee um thank you for taking
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
the time to hear my testimony today
 
00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
um so I am speaking on behalf of the
 
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
United Church of Christ economic Justice
 
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
team but in addition to our team
 
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
um our entire denomination which is the
 
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
largest Protestant denomination in the
 
00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:24.059 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire went on record
 
00:31:24.059 --> 00:31:25.250 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire went on record
about

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:25.789 align:start position:0%
about
um

00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
eight years ago as a denomination
 
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
um being in support then of increasing
 
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage in New Hampshire and
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
then with restoring the minimum wage
 
00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
after it was wiped off the state
 
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
statutes so I am also a resident of
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
Canaan and I would say as
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
as a church pastor
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
um I am one of the the many pastors who
 
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
are on the front lines of witnessing and
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
um individuals in our midst who are
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
low-wage workers from low-wage working
 
00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:03.539 align:start position:0%
families and we see every day the trauma
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
that occurs
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
um because of the challenges the the
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous challenges of of these
 
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
low-wage workers in New Hampshire trying
 
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
to just make ends meet and trying to
 
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
survive so we're certainly talking about
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
those several thousand that are making
 
00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
7.25 an hour but we're also talking
 
00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:21.299 align:start position:0%
about the many thousands of New
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire workers who are making 9 10 11
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
12 an hour and uh are just sort of one
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
crisis one small uh car repair bill or
 
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
health setback away from really being in
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
severe economic crisis and um so they
 
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
turned to the churches but this is not
 
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
sustainable and this is not good public
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
policy but I want to take a slightly
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
different direction as well and the
 
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
argument is or the argument that I have
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
heard over the years you know since 2011
 
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
or 12 I think when the minimum wage was
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
eliminated in New Hampshire was well the
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
market will provide don't worry the
 
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
market will provide and maybe sometimes
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
the market does provide except when it
 
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.070 align:start position:0%
the market does provide except when it
doesn't

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and I would say that even the
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
McDonald's corporation several years ago
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
in 2019 withdrew from a National
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
Coalition of of major employers Across
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
the Nation who were trying to suppress
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage and we're arguing
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
against any change because they realized
 
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
it was not good for their business so
 
00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
they announced on that they were
 
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
withdrawing from that Coalition because
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
they were realizing that the market and
 
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
the message that being conveyed by that
 
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
Coalition was not healthy economically
 
00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.830 align:start position:0%
Coalition was not healthy economically
so

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.110 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
when the market doesn't work for the
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
many thousands of New Hampshire workers
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
who are still making low wages
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
um then the message that we send is that
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
we don't care about the the many
 
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
thousands of New Hampshire workers who
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
care for our elderly who care for our
 
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
young and who are doing so much
 
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
Essential full-time work and yet they
 
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
still can't survive economically let
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
alone Thrive and it should not make us
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
proud as the state of New Hampshire be
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
to to be known as the stingy State or
 
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
the heartless State surrounded by other
 
00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
states in New England or the Northeast
 
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
who approach wage policy in a completely
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
different way
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
um so there was a recent news article I
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
I saw a headline
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure if a way that asks
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
the question will New Hampshire
 
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
legislators this year address the
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage and I would just say
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
to you that clinging to the federal wage
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
of 725 uh is not a message that attracts
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
young workers it's not a message that
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
will help cure the workforce short
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
shortage what it does is it sends a
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
message on to workers to flee to go
 
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
across the borders and to work elsewhere
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
so I just implore you if this
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
legislature if this committee and this
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
legislature cares about the economic
 
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
health of our state if you care about
 
00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:05.300 align:start position:0%
the needs of New Hampshire employers
 
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
who need to your help in putting forth
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
an image of New Hampshire being an
 
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:14.339 align:start position:0%
inviting place for good workers then
 
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
that speaks to the need to set a wage
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
floor just a wage floor saying this is a
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
figure below which New Hampshire will
 
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
not go in terms of rewarding full-time
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
work for adult workers and so in order
 
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
to have a reliable dedicated Workforce
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
it matters to the granite state that we
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
articulate a wage floor that's what this
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
bill does and so on behalf of my faith
 
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
the nomination and the many other people
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
of Faith wishes of Faith with whom I
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
work every day I would encourage you
 
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
implore you to find House Bill 57 ought
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:07.460 align:start position:0%

national Federation of Independent
 
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.030 align:start position:0%
national Federation of Independent
Business

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.690 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:20.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
committee Happy New Year to everyone and
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
welcome back to those that have been
 
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
here and welcome to the new members
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Bruce Berkey I'm the state
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
director for the national Federation of
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
Independent Business an organization
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
that has over 1400 small businesses
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and these are the
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
smallest of the small businesses these
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
are businesses that have between one and
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
ten sometimes 15 employees they're
 
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
they're small businesses they're not the
 
00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:50.099 align:start position:0%
the large corporations that that some
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
people have spoken of
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
and nfib is opposed to Senate Bill 57
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
and primarily because it injects an
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
artificial standard into a process into
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
an economy in which the business
 
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
Community prefers a open market
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
and more often than not an artificial
 
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
standard will disrupt that market
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
how you may ask what are the
 
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.790 align:start position:0%
how you may ask what are the
consequences

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
and what Studies have shown
 
00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:25.460 align:start position:0%
is that when there are artificial
 
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
standards increased minimum wages
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
fewer jobs do result
 
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
fewer hours for those current employees
 
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.109 align:start position:0%
fewer hours for those current employees
result

00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:39.020 align:start position:0%
it accelerates automation therefore
 
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
diminishing the need for additional
 
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.130 align:start position:0%
diminishing the need for additional
employees

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
hurting the very people that sponsors
 
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
are seeking to help here
 
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.010 align:start position:0%
are seeking to help here
and

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
the most telling point I think
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
is what's called wage compression and we
 
00:37:59.210 --> 00:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
haven't heard of that this morning
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
but if you have employees now and
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
believe me employees are making 15 18 an
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
hour to start throughout the state of
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I can speak specifically
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
to the ski industry who we do work for
 
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
and there's no one working at a skier in
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire for less than
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars an hour
 
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
so what happens when an artificial rate
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
gets put into the equation
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
for wages
 
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
when a minimum wage gets increased to
 
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
13.50 or to Fifteen dollars an hour
 
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
that person that started six months ago
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
or four months ago at fifteen dollars an
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
hour all of a sudden is saying wait a
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
minute I shouldn't be making minimum
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
wage I've been working I now deserve a
 
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.690 align:start position:0%
wage I've been working I now deserve a
raise

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
raise
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
and that creates a higher cost for the
 
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.910 align:start position:0%
and that creates a higher cost for the
employer

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
it causes some unrest perhaps within the
 
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
workforce of that particular employer
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
and it is it just does not create a
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
positive environment within the business
 
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.810 align:start position:0%
positive environment within the business
community

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
in addressing the amendment uh that
 
00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz put forward
 
00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:20.099 align:start position:0%
um if the spill was to pass
 
00:39:20.099 --> 00:39:21.349 align:start position:0%
um if the spill was to pass
uh

00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
there was one good piece in it and that
 
00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:26.339 align:start position:0%
was the training wage
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
nfib has supported training wages over
 
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
the years
 
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
and if this bill were to go forward
 
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
we would
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
um encourage this committee to maintain
 
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
the training wage language that's built
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
into the original bill
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
with that Mr chairman I'd be happy to
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
try and address any questions and thank
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you are there
 
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh thank you uh
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
so the the question I have for you
 
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
relates to what is a bigger problem the
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
lack of people available to work are the
 
00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
wages that are being paid in other words
 
00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.230 align:start position:0%
wages that are being paid in other words
would

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
would employers if they had a good pool
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
of people uh be better off does the
 
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:20.180 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
impact that in any way
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage at what level in other
 
00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.730 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage at what level in other
words

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:27.740 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a bigger problem for employers
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
is the lack of people available to work
 
00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:35.579 align:start position:0%
today opposed to the minimum wage
 
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
so so you have a follow-up
 
00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:41.099 align:start position:0%
representative that's it okay today that
 
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
is the case I mean there is a shortage
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
of workers and there's a strong economy
 
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
right now in terms of you know job
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
availability is is you know strong and
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
the the wage structure right now for
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
workers throughout the state of New
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is strong
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
and and so you know we're we're hopeful
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to see a
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
large leap in the in the minimum wage
 
00:41:08.579 --> 00:41:09.530 align:start position:0%
large leap in the in the minimum wage
rate

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
that's going to bump up against what
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
people are receiving now in wages and
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
create that wage compression that I
 
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
any other questions for this wedding
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
yes this representative thank you Mr
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
chair I know how to use the button now
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh so with the businesses that you work
 
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
with do they often so if they're having
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
a hard time finding employees they often
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
respond to that by raising the wages in
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
which they give new hires yes
 
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:41:49.609 --> 00:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
um as as I look at this on July 1st 2023
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh the minimum wage will increase about
 
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
80 percent
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
um could you address the uh the the
 
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
devastation that had happened to the the
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
employer that has 15 20 employees uh you
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
know how many would be going out of
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
business uh how many uh how many jobs
 
00:42:08.569 --> 00:42:08.579 align:start position:0%
would be eliminated uh and and that type
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
of stuff I I think it's uh I I won't
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
speak to specifics right here today but
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
the impact of a large increase like that
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
on a small business is going to make
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
that employer you know look at you know
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
the the hour structure that he has for
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
his or he or she has for their employees
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's going to look at you know
 
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
whether new jobs are going to be added
 
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
it's going to look at you know the the
 
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
wage compression issue is Big
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
um so there are consequences
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
can you explain wage compression to me
 
00:42:50.339 --> 00:42:52.730 align:start position:0%
can you explain wage compression to me
sure

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank you
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
if if I have five employees
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
and they're making between 13 and 15 an
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
hour today
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
and the minimum wage today is 7.25 and
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
on I believe it's September 1st the 23
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
the rate goes up to
 
00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.190 align:start position:0%
the rate goes up to
um

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
1350 or so uh
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
that person who's at 13 today obviously
 
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
gets a raise of 15 of 50 cents an hour
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
and that person who you know may have
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
been there 12 or 18 months with the
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
employer who's at 15 an hour today
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
is going to say
 
00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
that person you know that just started
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
last week at 13 an hour gonna raise a 50
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
50 cents
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
and you know I was making you know much
 
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
more than the minimum wage he's going to
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
go he or she's going to go to their
 
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
employer and say I deserve a raise now
 
00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:53.099 align:start position:0%
because I shouldn't be making you know
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
almost right at the minimum wage I
 
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
should be making much more than the
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and that's the compression
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
the upward compression on the overall
 
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative these default these
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
Silvestro I'm sorry okay thank you for
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
tell me how it is that New Hampshire
 
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
can't seem to move forward with this but
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
the other states how do they handle it
 
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
with their small businesses
 
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
I I won't speak for you know Vermont
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
Maine or Massachusetts or other states
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
um all I can say is that New Hampshire
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
today has the strongest economy in the
 
00:44:31.319 --> 00:44:32.410 align:start position:0%
today has the strongest economy in the
Northeast

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:32.420 align:start position:0%
Northeast
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
and it is uh been beneficial for
 
00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
employees it's been beneficial for
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
employers and uh we're we're hopeful
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
that that you know open market free
 
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.370 align:start position:0%
that that you know open market free
market

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
um process will continue and allow that
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
Mr Burkey just just to go back to that
 
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
compression issue once more
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't it be something an option
 
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
for the employer to say well that's this
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
is not a merit increase it's not because
 
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
that that person is working as well as
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
you are you you're working your
 
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
experience but that the legislature in
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
its wisdom has raised the minimum wage
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
and and if other employers don't don't
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
succumb to the pressure to raise the
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
wage then wouldn't it be wouldn't it
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
roughly stay the same the 15 person
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
would continue to make fifteen dollars
 
00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:32.339 align:start position:0%
not necessarily influenced by the raise
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
to or 1350.
 
00:45:36.609 --> 00:45:36.619 align:start position:0%
and any
 
00:45:36.619 --> 00:45:38.410 align:start position:0%
and any
yeah

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:38.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
any any number of scenarios can happen
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
there representative Caitlin and I
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate your question I think what
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say is that you know
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
the the person who is making 15 and all
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
of a sudden is just making a dollar more
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
or a dollar fifty more than the minimum
 
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:57.589 align:start position:0%
or a dollar fifty more than the minimum
wage

00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
wage
 
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
is going to you know feel
 
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
you know disappointed hey I I was hired
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know because of my skills because of
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
my capabilities at 15 an hour and now
 
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
that the minimum wage is at 13.50 and
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to be at 14 I ought to be making
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know 18 or 20 an hour and and that's
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's the rub there and sure the
 
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
employer can decide not to increase that
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
15 an hour employee but it's going to
 
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.510 align:start position:0%
15 an hour employee but it's going to
create

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
um you know some unrest some
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
disappointment within the workforce and
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
despite what you hear out there
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
employers like their employees and they
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
want to you know have a positive
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
environment because that's going to be
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative thanks to take my
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
question uh I just texted one of my
 
00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners and I asked him uh
 
00:46:59.089 --> 00:46:59.099 align:start position:0%
what the the starting wage for a an LNA
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
you know he he texted back he said he
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
thinks it's 13.50 would it be safe to
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
say that because the minimum wage is
 
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
going up six six dollars an hour that
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
these thirteen fifty dollars thirteen
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
fifty an hour employees would not want
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
1950 and the the the impact on our
 
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
County budgets uh would Skyrocket
 
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
history would certainly suggest that
 
00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative love thank you
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:31.140 align:start position:0%
um and just we're we're getting to the
 
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
edge of we're not here to explain to the
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
witnesses what we know we're here to
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
listen to them so
 
00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh representative McKenzie thank you um
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
can you uh is your position of your
 
00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
organization is that there should be no
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.970 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
so do you support any increase in
 
00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
minimum wage at all putting it back on
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
the books
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
we we do not support an increase in the
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
minimum wage there is no minimum wage
 
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
well I remember please to that end
 
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie we would
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that they have there is
 
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
a National Organization for nfib I
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
believe that they have opposed minimum
 
00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
I guess Mr chairman that's really not
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
the question I asked the question I ask
 
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:27.560 align:start position:0%
is does your organization support
 
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
minimum wage of any kind in the state of
 
00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:48:34.609 --> 00:48:34.619 align:start position:0%
they have not taken a position on
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
whether it should be on the books or not
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
uh next I would like to call
 
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339 align:start position:0%

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
trouble with names this morning I'd like
 
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:55.980 align:start position:0%

Viola katsime and I'm here representing
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
the granite state organizing project we
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
are a graduate organization that brings
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
people of Faith labor Community groups
 
00:49:23.089 --> 00:49:23.099 align:start position:0%
to work towards a more just world I'm
 
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
here to express our support for HP 57
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
relative to that minimum hourly wage
 
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
we're here in support because we're
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
talking about a bill that would
 
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
gradually increase could could you move
 
00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
the microphone a little closer some
 
00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
people weren't is this better that is
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
better thank you thank you uh we are
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
here to express our support for HB 57
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
relative to the hourly minimum wage
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
we're here in support because we're
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
talking about a bill that would
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
gradually increase the minimum wage from
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
Seven dollars an hour to Fifteen dollars
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
an hour by 2025 and index that to
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
inflation after 2026.
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
this is not a radical policy
 
00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
if the minimum wage had kept up with
 
00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:04.309 align:start position:0%
if the minimum wage had kept up with
productivity

00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
productivity
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
it would be more than 22 an hour
 
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
and that's according to an analysis that
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
has been done by the economic policy
 
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
Institute but instead New Hampshire has
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
decided to take a backseat and allow a
 
00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
minimum wage to fall to the predominium
 
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
wage of 7.25
 
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
which hasn't been raised since 2009.
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
think about that year
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
no prices have stayed that the same
 
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
since 2009. in 2019 raised up New
 
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is a coalition that I
 
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
work with we run a minimum wage
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
challenge we invited legislators who
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
were present at the time to live in the
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
shoes of avoid minimum workers
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
we asked them if they could leave on
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
wages for for people that are making
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
7.25 cents an hour for a week
 
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
guess what we did not get a lot of
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
responses I see some faces in this room
 
00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:00.059 align:start position:0%
who'd attempted that challenge and they
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
came back to us and said it was very
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
difficult they could not even get by on
 
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:08.339 align:start position:0%
groceries for a week so imagine so many
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
of our workers in the states a previous
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
speaker spoke about the fact that we
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
have about 9 000 workers in the state of
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who are getting 7.25 cents
 
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
an hour so imagine what their lives are
 
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.990 align:start position:0%
an hour so imagine what their lives are
like

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
we know that food prices housing costs
 
00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
child care costs healthcare costs have
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
all risen drastically
 
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
but what has State stagnant is our
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
to put this into contacts if you're a
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
single worker on minimum wage in New
 
00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you need to be working at
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
least over actually 100 hours a week to
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
afford a one-bedroom apartment and we're
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
talking about a median rent of twelve
 
00:51:47.089 --> 00:51:47.099 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's if you don't want to pay more
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
than 30 percent of your income to
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
housing which is what affordable housing
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
is according Todd
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh but let's say that samwaka has more
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
than one child
 
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
which means they'll need two-bedroom
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
apartment that same work at 7.25 cents
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
an hour would be need would need to work
 
00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
at least 145 hours a week
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
um I also have a live example grind
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
State organizing project runs a tenant
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
clinic since the pandemic we've been
 
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of cases of people getting
 
00:52:20.089 --> 00:52:20.099 align:start position:0%
evicted and in this tenant Clinic every
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
day we work with tenants finding
 
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
assistance for them we hear stories from
 
00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.190 align:start position:0%
assistance for them we hear stories from
families

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
there's a a worker currently working in
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
the Mall of New Hampshire at 16 an hour
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
she has to work 50 hours a week
 
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:36.059 align:start position:0%
to be able to qualify for a one bedroom
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
apartment if she doesn't have those 10
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
hours she doesn't qualify and what
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
that's what that means is that she's
 
00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
homeless she has nowhere to stay
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
so this is definitely a contributing
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
factor to the homeless crisis that we're
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
seeing across the state so I want you to
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
consider the factors of workers in the
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
ground state especially with rent with
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing Child Care
 
00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.109 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing Child Care
Transportation

00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
um I won't go back to the numbers
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
because they've already been shared
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
earlier by the previous speakers
 
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
but also to put into contacts we had
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative stop mentioned about the
 
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:14.220 align:start position:0%
living wage I encourage all of you to
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
try out the MIT living wage calculator
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
and look at what is needed for people in
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
your region you can pull up your phone
 
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
so after this I'd like you to do the
 
00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
research and see the numbers for
 
00:53:25.859 --> 00:53:26.750 align:start position:0%
research and see the numbers for
yourselves

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
yourselves
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
you need to be earning at least 17 an
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
hour if you're a single worker without
 
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
kids and of course if you have kids that
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
that number is much higher
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
so I just want to conclude by saying
 
00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:41.099 align:start position:0%
that raising the minimum wage 15 an hour
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh would be would would benefit greatly
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
people of color uh black people Hispanic
 
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579 align:start position:0%
people women uh you'd also pay uh
 
00:53:55.849 --> 00:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
increase the workers of it would also
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
increase the rate that pay for essential
 
00:53:57.839 --> 00:53:59.210 align:start position:0%
increase the rate that pay for essential
workers

00:53:59.210 --> 00:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
um who most of us really thanked during
 
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
the pandemic who are keeping our
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
students running I know nursing homes
 
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:05.870 align:start position:0%
students running I know nursing homes
going

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh increasing the minimum wage you've
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
all noticed that a lot of workers who
 
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
are low-wage workers when they get money
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
they tend to spend that money in the
 
00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
economy so this money is not going to be
 
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
used to buy second homes or invested in
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
the stock market it's going to
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
be getting your hair done or getting uh
 
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
going to a dinner date so it does
 
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
support businesses so I urge committee
 
00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
members uh support HP 57
 
00:54:31.859 --> 00:54:33.410 align:start position:0%
members uh support HP 57
and

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:35.329 --> 00:54:35.339 align:start position:0%
so therefore what has New Hampshire can
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
afford an adequate standard of living
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's the basic and the minimum that
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
this committee should do thank you thank
 
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:47.990 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony are there
questions

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%

missed part of that could you quickly

clarify uh she so was she getting 16 an
 
00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
hour she gets 16 an hour uh but for hard
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
qualify for a one bedroom apartment she
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
had to justify her income and there's no
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
way she could justify qualifying for a
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
one-bedroom apartment without showing
 
00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
that over time hours which is the 10
 
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
hours a week that she has to work
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire Council of churches
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
we represent nine denominations and
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
hundreds of congregations across the
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
granite state
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
I rise today to ask you to consider a
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
vote of ought to pass on HB 57 to raise
 
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
our state's minimum wage
 
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
in the context of my work I visit
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
congregations across the state
 
00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:18.020 align:start position:0%
and I hear the stories of people in Rich
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
varied and diverse communities
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
they cannot afford to feed their
 
00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.170 align:start position:0%
they cannot afford to feed their
families

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
they cannot afford to make ends meet
 
00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:30.059 align:start position:0%
our minimum wage in New Hampshire is
 
00:56:32.329 --> 00:56:32.339 align:start position:0%
functionally a poverty wage
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
it is not just or ethical
 
00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
it does not care for or regard the worth
 
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
and dignity of our citizens
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
we rank dead last in New England for
 
00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
states with a livable wage
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
the federal minimum wage was raised to
 
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
725 in 2009.
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
14 years ago
 
00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
that was not a fair wage in 2009 and it
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
is absolutely not a fair wage in 2023
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
you have heard the statistics from
 
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
multiple sources this morning and New
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%

percent of our Workforce are working for
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%

00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
thousand of our neighbors our friends
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
people we care about

they cannot Thrive we cannot Thrive
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
without a living minimum wage
 
00:57:37.849 --> 00:57:37.859 align:start position:0%
today we have an easy opportunity to
 
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
take a step to join our New England
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
Neighbors in raising the wage
 
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
low-wage workers are of deep essential
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
and high value to the Granite State they
 
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
deserve to be paid a living wage for

00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
of God
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%

Stater I grew up in Manchester where I
 
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
live now with my husband and young
 
00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.089 align:start position:0%
live now with my husband and young
sister

00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
sister
 
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
I've had a job since I was in elementary
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
school I think many of us can reflect
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
back to our first positions our first
 
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
jobs that we had
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
and I had my first bills when I was a
 
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.109 align:start position:0%
and I had my first bills when I was a
teenager

00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
teenager
 
00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
I want to reflect I want to share a
 
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
story about the last time that I earned
 
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
7.25 an hour and I'd like you all to
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
kind of take down a walk down memory
 
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
lane with me and reflect on when was the
 
00:59:28.849 --> 00:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
last time you earned 725 an hour had to
 
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
live off of that income
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
the last time I earned 7.25 an hour was
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
in 2012.
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
my then boyfriend who is now my husband
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
both of us worked five to six jobs
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
between the two of us I wish our bills
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
were artificial because then we wouldn't
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
have had to work so many jobs in order
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
to make ends meet
 
00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
I worked occasionally as an art model I
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
worked occasionally in a restaurant and
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
I also worked part-time as an attendant
 
00:59:59.210 --> 00:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
at a local gym in Nashua all for minimum
 
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:00.710 align:start position:0%
at a local gym in Nashua all for minimum
wage

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
wage
 
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
in comparison to today's prices living
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
expenses were low for us and still my
 
01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
partner and I struggled to make our
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
bills to be able to pay what we needed
 
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
every month even though we combined our
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
incomes and he was fortunate enough to
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
live at home with his family while I
 
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
shared a two-bedroom apartment a small
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
one in Manchester with a roommate
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
this was unsustainable and a year later
 
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
I would move to Boston where I would
 
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
finally get my first job that would pay
 
01:00:30.289 --> 01:00:30.299 align:start position:0%
me 15 an hour
 
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum wage not only brings
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
us on par with our regional neighbors it
 
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
would also make us go be it would also
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
make us competitive as a state and it
 
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
would go a long way to not only support
 
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire workers strengthen our
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
social fabric it would also go a long
 
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:48.900 align:start position:0%
way to retaining the talent and the
 
01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
skills of the young people of our state
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
who are often overrepresented in the
 
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
number of workers who are paid at or
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
near minimum wage I have many friends
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of years who have
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
had to leave or are considering leaving
 
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because they simply cannot
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
afford to live here on the wages that
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
they earn here
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
I couldn't live off of minimum wage then
 
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
and with the Steep increases in prices
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
in both food and gas and rent putting
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
being able to make your bills every
 
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
month the hard-working people of New
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can't live off of minimum wage
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
now just like they could I couldn't live
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
off one then
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
the minimum amount one must earn in
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
order to house yourself and to take care
 
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
of your basic needs is not an artificial
 
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
standard it's just math
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is not a competition between
 
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
employers and employees raising the
 
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
minimum wage would go a long way to
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
strengthening the fabric and the network
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
and the relationships in our economy and
 
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
so I urge you to pass HP 57.
 
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
whether we do it now or we do it later
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
we must be able to provide for our
 
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
communities thank you
 
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.710 align:start position:0%

Hopkins h-o-p-k-i-n-s thank you you're
welcome

01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I speak as one of my colleagues
 
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
did as somebody on the front lines who
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
comes in contact with people living on
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
the edge of homelessness or are homeless
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
people who come to our congregation
 
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
looking for help
 
01:02:58.609 --> 01:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
looking for help for rent for gas for
 
01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
utilities for all sorts of things and as
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
my former colleague said it is untenable
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
our church is uh has some money that we
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
use to help people but it is limited
 
01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
um and so but the other thing I want to
 
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
say is having all these uh meeting all
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
these folks who are on the edge or
 
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
homeless I will say most of them have
 
01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:23.990 align:start position:0%
homeless I will say most of them have
jobs

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh I have actually driven people from
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
the homeless shelter in the morning to
 
01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
their job at Target or at friendlies I
 
01:03:32.819 --> 01:03:34.130 align:start position:0%
their job at Target or at friendlies I
have

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
served at our soup kitchen here in
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
Concord and seen people come through
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
with their Walmart shirts on after work
 
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
and I don't I might be crazy possible
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
but I just believe if you work you
 
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
should have enough money to buy food and
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
have have shelter I think that's a basic
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
human thing so what is the problem well
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
we know housing's too high that's part
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
of the problem and I would also argue
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
from being with families our church
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
participates in a homeless program for
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
families where we house them in our
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
congregation four times a year
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
that talking to those families the two
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
things that are keeping them from being
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient are a good paying job
 
01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
people can find a job but a good paying
 
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
job that actually pays rent and housing
 
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
costs those are the two things and I
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
would suggest that is all of your that's
 
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
why you're we're sent here it to Concord
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
to do that work to help people who are
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
living on the edge to be self-sufficient
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.690 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
questions

01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
next up I would like to call Henry vayu
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
representing nhlra speaking in
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill for three minutes
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:57.299 align:start position:0%
Henry vayu and I'm here on behalf of the
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
Association and we come in to this
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%
discussion in a unique perspective with
 
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
regards to the tip wage
 
01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
so the minimum wage obviously is there
 
01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:16.940 align:start position:0%
obviously to protect low wage workers
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to tipped employees
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
they certainly aren't low wage workers
 
01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
you go to any restaurant and the highest
 
01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
paid in the restaurant are those in the
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
front of the house the servers making
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know on average between 19 and 25 an
 
01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
hour in a in a mid uh range restaurant
 
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
casual dining restaurant
 
01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
um so we don't think there's a need to
 
01:05:50.049 --> 01:05:50.059 align:start position:0%
address tip wage workers
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
we get involved in this discussion
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
because the minimum wage statute has a
 
01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
minimum cash wage that the employer pays
 
01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
to the server and that's in the statute
 
01:06:06.849 --> 01:06:06.859 align:start position:0%
and in the proposed amendment
 
01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:10.140 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz includes tipped
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
employees as getting the CPI adjusted
 
01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.730 align:start position:0%
employees as getting the CPI adjusted
annually

01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
annually
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
tip workers already see their wages
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
increase annually I was speaking
 
01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.829 align:start position:0%
increase annually I was speaking
yesterday

01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
with an operator who has a number of
 
01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:29.660 align:start position:0%
locations around the state
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
and he's increased his menu prices since
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
1984 three percent annually so that it's
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
a nice slow creep up that the customer
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't even realize and with chip
 
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
workers they get paid a percentage of
 
01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:50.180 align:start position:0%
the meal at the price of the meal and so
 
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
they already see their wages increase
 
01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.270 align:start position:0%
they already see their wages increase
annually

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
annually
 
01:06:58.329 --> 01:06:58.339 align:start position:0%
so for that reason
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
and Mr Berkey did a good job of speaking
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
to the minimal age itself so I won't get
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
into that but we would oppose this bill
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
in the amendment as presented
 
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:07:14.809 --> 01:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'll ask you a similar question to that
 
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
of Mr Burkey so is the position of your
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
organization there should be no minimum
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
wage in the state
 
01:07:26.099 --> 01:07:27.770 align:start position:0%
wage in the state
um

01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't want to speak to that
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
portion I largely wanted to address the
 
01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
tip wage
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
um and uh the fact that we don't think
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
that um the legislation should address
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
the tip wage
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up question please
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
follow us the current uh situation
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
regarding tip wages is that the
 
01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:52.250 align:start position:0%
regarding tip wages is that the
um

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
every employer in the state of New
 
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is responsible for paying the
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage which is 7.25.
 
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
and the in the case of Tiff workers they
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
make uh they make their wages are much
 
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
less and so it is the tips that offset
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
the employee's responsibility to the uh
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
to the tip wage is that correct so uh
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
the tips are wages in the statute it
 
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
says that tips are wages that the
 
01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
property the employee
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
um they get the employer pays the FICA
 
01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
tax on those wages on those tips the
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
tipped servers are required to report
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
those to the employer and the employer
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah is there another question
 
01:08:43.739 --> 01:08:45.890 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah is there another question
uh

01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
representative adjutant you are a
 
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill I was not
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
mindful of that earlier but thank you
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
very much for your cooperation
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
01:08:58.729 --> 01:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
Vegas good to see you once again uh I
 
01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
recall hearing a testimony
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
uh during an earlier talk about tip
 
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
wages and minimum wage that restaurants
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
raise their prices six percent annually
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
but I still question whether or not a
 
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
person should earn based on the price of
 
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
the meal that they deliver to the table
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
is that is that fear in your in your
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
mind is is the is the person who uh
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
brings you a breakfast in a diner
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
working less hard than the person who
 
01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
brings you your meal at a you know white
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
table cloth restaurant
 
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question
 
01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
um I think if you asked folks in the
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
back of the house
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
whether they'd like in the back of the
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
house meaning uh in the kitchen area
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
those aren't tipped employees whether
 
01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
they'd rather work in the front of the
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
house and earn what those in the front
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
of the house earn I think you would find
 
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people in the back of the
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
house would like to work in the front of
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
the house and earn those types of wages
 
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up have you considered
 
01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
a rotation so that the people could get
 
01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
an equal Taste of uh back in front of
 
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure uh different restaurant
 
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
operators have different practices and I
 
01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether that occurs in some
 
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
um our customers legally required to tip
 
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh no there's nothing in the statue that
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
requires them to but
 
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
um again if you look at what uh is
 
01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:47.219 align:start position:0%
reported and what employers pay the the
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
taxes on uh customers are tipping
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.709 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
um

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
what impact does the fact that someone's
 
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
working for tips what impact does that
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
have on their work environment
 
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
um I've heard a talk of harassment and
 
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
that type of thing in order to uh
 
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
enduring harassment in order to maintain
 
01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.310 align:start position:0%
enduring harassment in order to maintain
their

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully maintain their tips
 
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.229 align:start position:0%
hopefully maintain their tips
um

01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
I don't I would suggest talking with uh
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
servers in restaurants in your district
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
and find out whether they would rather
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
get just a flat 15 minimum with no tips
 
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.169 align:start position:0%
get just a flat 15 minimum with no tips
or

01:11:36.169 --> 01:11:36.179 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:11:36.179 --> 01:11:37.130 align:start position:0%
or
um

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
the cash wage plus the tips in Maine I
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
was going to save this for the next turn
 
01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
but in Maine when they did away with the
 
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
tip wage
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
back in 2016
 
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
they restored in 2017 there were over
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
500 servers that showed up at the
 
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
hearing because they didn't want to do
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
away with that kind of practice and the
 
01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
legislature in Maine restored the tip
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.070 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
okay

01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
next I would ask
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
um or Stephen nass who represents the
 
01:12:21.649 --> 01:12:21.659 align:start position:0%
Free State Food Network he is in
 
01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill and signed up for
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
three minutes
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Stephen Ness of Milton New
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like I uh put on the card I
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
represent the Free State Food Network
 
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
which is a network of about 50 members
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh that are Professionals in the food
 
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
industry uh they range from servers
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
bartenders managers and restaurant tours
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
as well as chefs I myself own a
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
restaurant and I'm the chef of a small
 
01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
restaurant on uh Seacoast and New
 
01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here uh I really appreciated
 
01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
the economic reality that some of the
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
previous opposition to this bill brought
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
up so I thought I'd talk about my own
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
anecdotal lived experience and try and
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
hit on some uh ideas that haven't been
 
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
um myself I uh came up through the
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
restaurant business uh as a young adult
 
01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
and started at the lowest rungs working
 
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
for minimum wage and slowly worked my
 
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
way up until I was able to uh afford to
 
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
start my own restaurant so I can
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
personally attest to the experience of
 
01:13:33.169 --> 01:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
working for minimum wage
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
I could say here in New Hampshire right
 
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
now all restaurants are hiring uh if
 
01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
somebody is looking for work in a
 
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
restaurant they can definitely just show
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
up with no experience and get hired
 
01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:49.640 align:start position:0%
right now and I can attest to uh
 
01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:52.140 align:start position:0%
dishwashers at least on the Sea Coast
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
where I live are making double minimum
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
wage with no experience they just need
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
to show up occasionally and generally
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
get the work done and they're going to
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
make double minimum wage so I find it a
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
little bit telling
 
01:14:06.719 --> 01:14:07.630 align:start position:0%
little bit telling
um

01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
that no people working for minimum wage
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
were brought in to testify today because
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
I believe that that number is extremely
 
01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.490 align:start position:0%
I believe that that number is extremely
slim

01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
slim
 
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
um I think if you were to ask and we've
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
been talking about tipped workers
 
01:14:22.729 --> 01:14:22.739 align:start position:0%
especially if you were I can attest that
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
if you were to ask tipped workers
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
servers bartenders and the like in this
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
state which they would prefer tips or no
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
tips universally they will want the
 
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
tipped wage because uh I can confirm
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
that the tipped workers are making more
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
money than just about anybody else in
 
01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
the business uh oftentimes more than the
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
owners themselves
 
01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
I worked for a year at a restaurant that
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
has now gone under that attempted to do
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
away with tipped wages and pay servers
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh flat fee or a flat a flat wage as
 
01:14:59.630 --> 01:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
though they were in the back of house
 
01:15:02.209 --> 01:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
and in order to do so they did have to
 
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
pay 25 35 an hour uh while the kitchen
 
01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
staff was getting paid 15 16 17 18 an
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
hour and the result was uh wait staff
 
01:15:17.209 --> 01:15:17.219 align:start position:0%
that complained constantly about how
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
little they were making and how much
 
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
work they had to do
 
01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:21.830 align:start position:0%
work they had to do
um

01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
fighting over the various shifts that
 
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
because they wanted to work the slowest
 
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
shifts because they're going to make the
 
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
same amount of money as though they were
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
working the busier shifts which are
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
actually more valuable to the business
 
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day we ended up
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
having to bring tipped wages back and uh
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
eventually the business did close
 
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
because we were unable to well a
 
01:15:47.090 --> 01:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
multitude of reasons but in part uh the
 
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
servers couldn't get brought back down
 
01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
to their lower wages and add-on tips
 
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
they had to add on tips with their new
 
01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
higher wages but uh uh to kind of pivot
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
to another uh
 
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
area that hasn't been talked about
 
01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.149 align:start position:0%
area that hasn't been talked about
um

01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
we've spoken about uh if we raise
 
01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
minimum wage that the wages will have to
 
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
rise for other workers with uh wage
 
01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
compression which is definitely a very
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
real uh reality there but we haven't
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
talked about uh losing the workers uh at
 
01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
the bottom end who might be making
 
01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
minimum wage now
 
01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:25.130 align:start position:0%
minimum wage now
um

01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:27.169 --> 01:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
that if we were to raise minimum wage
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
the businesses wouldn't be no longer
 
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
able to support those workers
 
01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:33.110 align:start position:0%
able to support those workers
um

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
and I can give a personal anecdote of
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
this I have a special needs sister my
 
01:16:39.649 --> 01:16:39.659 align:start position:0%
older sister has Down syndrome and she's
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
always had a hard time finding work
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
she's not the greatest worker and she
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
never will be uh but uh it's a lot
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
easier for her to find work if we can
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
negotiate lower wages because it's for
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
her it's much more important to have a
 
01:16:58.729 --> 01:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
job than to make a high amount of money
 
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
in that job it's much more important for
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
her to have skills and uh do things
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the day that keep her mind
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
engaged and keep her interacting with
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
the public than it is to try and make
 
01:17:15.729 --> 01:17:15.739 align:start position:0%
the quote Living wage
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
when when minimum wage Rises these these
 
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh employers who maybe they're just
 
01:17:25.729 --> 01:17:25.739 align:start position:0%
asking to do simple tasks like put
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
bottles into boxes of like uh beer
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
sampler cases or stock shelves where she
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
can go at her own pace and you know it
 
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be the most perfect work
 
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
because it's easily corrected
 
01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:40.970 align:start position:0%
because it's easily corrected
um

01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
if if now all of a sudden we're saying
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
she needs to make say fifteen dollars an
 
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
hour uh these businesses aren't going to
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
want to take a risk and hire her anymore
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to let her go and and
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
either uh have nobody do that or have a
 
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
robot do that job or pay somebody that's
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
more skilled is going to do it faster so
 
01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
it would directly uh harm my family
 
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
member like that and uh thank you that's
 
01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
all I have to add I'll take any
 
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
are there questions for this Witness
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again for your
 
01:18:15.239 --> 01:18:16.669 align:start position:0%

only two cards left
 
01:18:23.209 --> 01:18:23.219 align:start position:0%

01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
movement politics director for rights
 
01:18:40.729 --> 01:18:40.739 align:start position:0%
and democracy of New Hampshire but uh I
 
01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
do want to testify initially as we made
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
a written testimony to the committee but
 
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
uh after hearing the comments from the
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the Independent Business
 
01:18:51.169 --> 01:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
Association about the mania's key areas
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
he doesn't recollect the fact that many
 
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
skewers pay less than 15 an hour uh I
 
01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
worked for 20 years at the bretonwood
 
01:18:59.930 --> 01:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
ski area up in the North Country so I
 
01:19:01.729 --> 01:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
can tell you for a fact that that's
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
wrong that information was wrong uh you
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
know I I flip bets I I you know run ski
 
01:19:09.169 --> 01:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
lifts I serve tables I bus tables I
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
clean I clean dishes I did all that
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
stuff and I know currently at this point
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's people working at those
 
01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
businesses they're actually making less
 
01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
of 15 an hour uh and they're actually
 
01:19:20.570 --> 01:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
some places that for example they
 
01:19:23.209 --> 01:19:23.219 align:start position:0%
catering businesses they charge 30 of
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
the initial bill and they keep it they
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
keep the money for the property the
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
hotel keeps the money and they offer the
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
servers to get paid a flat wage of like
 
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
16 15 an hour so they make that money so
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
I can tell you for a fact that that's
 
01:19:39.169 --> 01:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
the information is wrong uh and I'm here
 
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
to you know to express my support for HP
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
for this bill uh because I think it's
 
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
important it's important that we we do
 
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
we do this it's the right thing it's the
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
moral thing and I hope you uh agree with
 
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
me on that and that's all I do want to
 
01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:51.890 align:start position:0%
me on that and that's all I do want to
say

01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
uh last up uh we told the prime sponsor
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz that she could
 
01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
save her testimony for the end and she's
 
01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
not sure how long she's going to speak
 
01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.189 align:start position:0%
not sure how long she's going to speak
but

01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sure she is mindful that we're
 
01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
running a little bit behind and
 
01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.790 align:start position:0%
running a little bit behind and
we'll

01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
speak for allowing me to do this Mr
 
01:20:24.590 --> 01:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
chair I am representative Schultz from
 
01:20:26.330 --> 01:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
Concord you're sitting in my district
 
01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:27.890 align:start position:0%
Concord you're sitting in my district
yay

01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
yay
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to speak last because I love
 
01:20:33.970 --> 01:20:33.980 align:start position:0%
having the conversation around the myths
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
and to address some of the questions but
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
before I get to that I just want to
 
01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
briefly say when we're talking about
 
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
work when we're talking about Labor and
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
the people who hold them it oftentimes
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
it can seem like people on a spreadsheet
 
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
looking at numbers that maybe your
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
Investments get stuff like that but to
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
me as the daughter of a receptionist and
 
01:20:59.630 --> 01:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
a baggage handler
 
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
and they were the children of a Bourbon
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
maker and a paramutual clerk at the
 
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
racetrack good union jobs
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I know that not everybody wants to be
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
an entrepreneur not everyone wants to go
 
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
to or could go to college
 
01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
we need all of the jobs that are filled
 
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
are trying to be filled and the notion
 
01:21:24.729 --> 01:21:24.739 align:start position:0%
that all labor has dignity matters to me
 
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
and what is amazing to me about this
 
01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.330 align:start position:0%
and what is amazing to me about this
conversation

01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
is one aspect of what is traditionally
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
Republican thinking seems to have just
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
disappeared in the granite state the
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
notion of personal responsibility the
 
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
notion of pulling yourself up by your
 
01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
bootstraps the notion of rugged
 
01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:46.370 align:start position:0%
bootstraps the notion of rugged
individualism

01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
individualism
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
but if you are making a low wage and
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
maybe would like to start a business
 
01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
whatever it is completely impossible I
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
hope that if you take anything away from
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
this conversation I feel like most of us
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
arrived with obviously I support the
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
bill I feel like these conversations
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
start in a way where everybody's already
 
01:22:08.209 --> 01:22:08.219 align:start position:0%
made up their mind everybody in the room
 
01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:11.219 align:start position:0%
I would like to invite everyone in some
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
Forum I'm probably too low on the totem
 
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
pole to host this with Business Leaders
 
01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
with workers with legislators or a
 
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
robust discussion about Labor and wages
 
01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
and jobs in New Hampshire because there
 
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
is a serious problem
 
01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
and the notion that someone can pull up
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
their bootstraps when they don't even
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
have shoes is something that really
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
matters the fact that all of the people
 
01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
that the pastor and I used to work for
 
01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
him uh Pastor Hopkins I know he meets
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
with many people who are at
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
um really Financial
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
a really difficult Crossroads and he is
 
01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:56.219 align:start position:0%
right everyone that was coming in has a
 
01:22:59.050 --> 01:22:59.060 align:start position:0%
job if you want personal responsibility
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
if you want people in America to do what
 
01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
they're asked to do as a participant in
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
society an able-bodied person why would
 
01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
you ever want Working Poor to be
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
something in our vocabulary in the
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
wealthiest Nation on Earth and one of
 
01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
the wealthiest states in America the
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
wealthiest state to default to five to
 
01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
to the federal minimum wage
 
01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
is to me not even a moral issue it is
 
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
but also a broken capitalism and I'll
 
01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
get to that in just a minute but I do
 
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
want to answer the a few points that
 
01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
were raised obviously the restaurant
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
conversation will happen with the next
 
01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
bill but representative Granger had
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
asked if tip wages were a part of this
 
01:23:45.410 --> 01:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
it is and we'll get to that and I think
 
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
some folks answered that
 
01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:50.540 align:start position:0%
um it was also raised that
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh going to the first step of 1350 would
 
01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
be a I think you said a high 80 percent
 
01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:00.050 align:start position:0%
be a I think you said a high 80 percent
jump

01:24:00.050 --> 01:24:00.060 align:start position:0%
jump
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
well okay
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
that is exactly what we can compare
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
ourselves to when we literally look at
 
01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
the rest of New England why would we
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
want the race to the bottom again
 
01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
Working Poor in capitalism makes no
 
01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:15.590 align:start position:0%
Working Poor in capitalism makes no
sense

01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
another person talked well we had a
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
great conversation about wage
 
01:24:19.679 --> 01:24:20.870 align:start position:0%
great conversation about wage
compression

01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
compression
 
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
the truth of that is a rising tide
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
raises all boats
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
the worst argument to me against this
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
bill would be oh people who already make
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
a certain wage would be unhappy I don't
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
think they're who we should be pleasing
 
01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
I'm glad they have that wage if we pay
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
everyone in the granite state
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
better than we are now and by the way I
 
01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
think the point was made well by some of
 
01:24:53.209 --> 01:24:53.219 align:start position:0%
our previous speakers that 15 is not a
 
01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
living wage either it's too low in my
 
01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
opinion this is a modest pill in that
 
01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:59.090 align:start position:0%
opinion this is a modest pill in that
sense

01:24:59.090 --> 01:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
it is not a living wage
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
so again
 
01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
um why would we have the cut the
 
01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
category Working Poor in our in our
 
01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:11.450 align:start position:0%
category Working Poor in our in our
state

01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
um I will skip like my 300 points I
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
could say
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
I'll save that for that robust
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
discussion I hope we can have
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
um just quick bullet points
 
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
Republican Rank and pile Granite State
 
01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:28.090 align:start position:0%
Republican Rank and pile Granite State
voters

01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:28.100 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
Republican Rank and filed voters in
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
America a majority want a better minimum
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
wage period and all of the questions
 
01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
around the economics of how it is here
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
compared to other places we've had now
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
so many places so many other states
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
raise the minimum wage so many cities we
 
01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
have plenty of data to compare it to and
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
the notion I I will say I agree with um
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Burke on the point he was saying that
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
there is a lag in the economy at the
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
very beginning I actually that is what
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
the research shows at the very beginning
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
when you implement a raise in the
 
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
minimum wage but that very quickly
 
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
rebounds and when it rebounds we have a
 
01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
all of that money
 
01:26:19.729 --> 01:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
stays in the economy for the most part
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
everybody who makes those wages
 
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
I need to have that money to spend on
 
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.169 --> 01:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
um I want to make sure address the other
 
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
point I'm also really happy that um the
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
Free State network was here I think
 
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
talking about the race to the bottom
 
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
um I do believe most of us in the
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
legislature believe in a
 
01:26:44.639 --> 01:26:45.470 align:start position:0%
legislature believe in a
um

01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
and want people to participate in
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
society and want to look at everyone for
 
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
the most part as
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
in just a general human sense that we
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
love our neighbors
 
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
um most free Staters are supporters of
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
rational self-interest and to support
 
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
themselves alone I don't think that's
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
mainstream I think what we want is and I
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
think another of my friends from the
 
01:27:13.129 --> 01:27:13.139 align:start position:0%
business Community said this
 
01:27:16.129 --> 01:27:16.139 align:start position:0%
most uh employers like their employees
 
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
because they're in front of them and
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're human beings and for the most part
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
we do want to have
 
01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.030 align:start position:0%
we do want to have
um

01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:25.139 align:start position:0%
we want our state to be a nice place to
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
live and everything about attracting and
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
keeping workers for the high end also is
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
going to require people to hold those
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
jobs all labor has dignity to do the
 
01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
jobs that maybe you wouldn't do or I
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do so I would like to encourage
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
everyone that is a legislator and I do
 
01:27:45.649 --> 01:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
this to talk to the people in your
 
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
District when you're pumping gas talk to
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
the clerk there when you're
 
01:27:54.649 --> 01:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
I I pick a job seriously talk to people
 
01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
in your District the majority of people
 
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
want this to happen and you know
 
01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.050 align:start position:0%
want this to happen and you know
um

01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:05.689 --> 01:28:05.699 align:start position:0%
in this proud Nation the wealthiest
 
01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
country on Earth the beacon of light on
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
a hill the Ronald Reagan notion of
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
personal responsibility and rugged
 
01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:17.300 align:start position:0%
individualism only works if we actually
 
01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
create a scenario where everyone is
 
01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
valued not in a non-profit handout sense
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
my parents never wanted a handout they
 
01:28:28.729 --> 01:28:28.739 align:start position:0%
volunteered they wanted to be able to do
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
their jobs work for their employer it
 
01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:34.100 align:start position:0%
wasn't the top priority in their lives
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
they wanted to live a life where they
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
left their work at their work they were
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
fine that people made money off of their
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
work because they liked their jobs and
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
the people they worked with we have lost
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
that as we've had a race to the bottom
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to keep and create a
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
good robust economy you can't let one
 
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
sector of that economy
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
need to go on Public Assistance or those
 
01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.550 align:start position:0%
need to go on Public Assistance or those
businesses

01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
need to um well those businesses
 
01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
essentially have a backdoor corporate
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
welfare where we're subsidizing the
 
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
wages of those employers you should want
 
01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
every person who is working hard to do
 
01:29:16.450 --> 01:29:16.460 align:start position:0%
the right thing to make a decent enough
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
wage where their work is valued and
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
their role in our economy is valued and
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
they don't need to seek assistance for
 
01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
just the basics we should want our
 
01:29:31.930 --> 01:29:31.940 align:start position:0%
economy and our capitalism to be
 
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
interdependent in that way and I I still
 
01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
have four thousand other points but I'll
 
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
stop there
 
01:29:43.729 --> 01:29:43.739 align:start position:0%
thank you uh are there questions yes sir
 
01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for uh
 
01:29:47.689 --> 01:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
coming out here today uh so you
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh you don't believe 15
 
01:29:51.649 --> 01:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
an hour is enough uh do you support 50
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
as a minimum wage if that were a bill
 
01:29:56.209 --> 01:29:56.219 align:start position:0%
that we were discussing today I'm sure
 
01:29:58.610 --> 01:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
any worker would love to make fifty
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
dollars if they are making 15. I will
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
say this that does remind me of another
 
01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
point the last time I was able to get
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
this statistic and I'll get the most
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
updated one was a year or two ago
 
01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh over a hundred and forty four
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
thousand Granite Staters make under 15
 
01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
an hour so I think to get to the heart
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
of your question I don't think they
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
expect fifty dollars I think they do
 
01:30:24.770 --> 01:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
expect a wage that is reasonable enough
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
to pay rent
 
01:30:30.530 --> 01:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
have food raise a family and live a life
 
01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
that covers just the basics so while I
 
01:30:36.169 --> 01:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
personally would love to see a much
 
01:30:38.209 --> 01:30:38.219 align:start position:0%
higher wage that is closer to a living
 
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
wage so people could go on vacation save
 
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
for retirement pay off student loans you
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
know afford medical bills if they have
 
01:30:48.770 --> 01:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
medical debt that is a whole other
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
conversation but I appreciate the
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
question and I don't think that is
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
needed for this bill
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
bow up
 
01:31:01.129 --> 01:31:01.139 align:start position:0%
um so would you or would so if there was
 
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
a bill that said that we were raising
 
01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage to fifty dollars would
 
01:31:07.729 --> 01:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
you support it or would you oppose it
 
01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
uh that sounds interesting I will say I
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
don't know how to answer that because I
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
don't see anyone filing a bill like that
 
01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
um if that question is intended to show
 
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
something and who I am and the value of
 
01:31:24.169 --> 01:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
this bill I I just
 
01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure her I really genuinely just
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
not sure how to answer that I do
 
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
appreciate the conversation and I would
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
love to have that bigger conversation
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage folks to look at
 
01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
the MIT living wage calculator
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
um because a basic living is really
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
crazy and if you are making ends meet
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
and you don't need to budget and
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
everything's cool it's hard to
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
understand what life is like in the
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
everyday world because or for people
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
making a low wage because it's it's
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
expensive to make low wages you're
 
01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
you're making ends meet in a way that
 
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
becomes more expensive in a weird way it
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
it takes up too much of your time to go
 
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
to Pastor John's Church or other places
 
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
to seek assistance to avoid becoming
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
homeless to get out of homelessness
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
that's the reality that people are
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
facing so I like that there are better
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
paying jobs in New Hampshire I like that
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot more small businesses
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
per capita than any other state in the
 
01:32:25.370 --> 01:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
country but we would have more if people
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
were in a position to become more
 
01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial if they could just do
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
the basics in their lives and they
 
01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:33.070 align:start position:0%
the basics in their lives and they
aren't

01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:37.850 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:41.270 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
testimony

01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:32:43.129 --> 01:32:43.139 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you had spoken
 
01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
with some workers at a gas station and
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
um their support of a pay increase
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
do you remember the days of when we used
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
to have full service gas stations and we
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
had somebody pumping our gas for us I
 
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
will now admit I'm from Kentucky
 
01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:58.250 align:start position:0%
will now admit I'm from Kentucky
originally

01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
um I still occasionally go to one of the
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
gas stations in town that does that
 
01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
um so I'm sorry to say while I'm married
 
01:33:07.490 --> 01:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire I don't have that
 
01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:08.990 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire I don't have that
memory

01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
memory
 
01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't remember I don't even
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry follow-up yes um
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
are there any gas stations around
 
01:33:18.649 --> 01:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
anymore that have full service uh in in
 
01:33:20.330 --> 01:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that you're aware of yes
 
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
there's one at exit
 
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
16 off of I-93 right on the rotary to
 
01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
the east
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
yes there are thank you and I believe
 
01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
the owner is the person who
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
um traditionally is the person who pumps
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
the gas
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
foreign further questions yes
 
01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative Davao
 
01:33:44.090 --> 01:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.530 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:33:48.050 --> 01:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of talk about the 15 an
 
01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.129 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of talk about the 15 an
hour

01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:49.139 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
um my question is in January 2026 it's I
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
call it like a variable uh minimum wage
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
pretending we're sitting there in 2026
 
01:34:00.890 --> 01:34:00.900 align:start position:0%
right now do you know what the minimum
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
wage would be
 
01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're using this year's
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
consumer index is it more than 15 is it
 
01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
less do you know what that number is
 
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
um I of course can't say none of us can
 
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
say unless someone has a time machine
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
and hasn't shared it I'd be sad about
 
01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:16.970 align:start position:0%
and hasn't shared it I'd be sad about
that

01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
um please share it uh of course we can't
 
01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
know for sure what 2026 brings but I do
 
01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
know on January 1st we heard about all
 
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
those States including every state
 
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
around us that had a raise in the
 
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and we also heard about
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
Social Security checks that are tied to
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
Cola had a raise I think that that value
 
01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
of the dollar in New Hampshire I'm glad
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
you raised the inflation issue if you
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
can't afford it in a good year when the
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
economy is fantastic and prices for food
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
and gas Etc are average you're
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
struggling but not as much as you are
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
right now so to account for that is
 
01:34:58.610 --> 01:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
important and that we haven't
 
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
had a cola attached to the minimum wage
 
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
at any level federal state Etc I think
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
is a real mistake
 
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
so I believe regardless of the answer to
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
your question I would still support a
 
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
cola well I think I actually asked my
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
question wrong sorry oh okay please
 
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
what I'm getting is say we are
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
basing our minimum wage pretend it's
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
your bill for 2026 and we're basing our
 
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
minimum wage off your new the new way
 
01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it what would that
 
01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
number be for this year with the
 
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
inflation do you know I don't know the
 
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
answer I'm just wondering if that was
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
over 15 as it is
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
or not I I don't know the I don't know
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
how to answer that question I do know if
 
01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
we'd kept pace with the cost of living
 
01:35:43.570 --> 01:35:43.580 align:start position:0%
from when the minimum wage was first
 
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
introduced it would definitely be above
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
15 in America
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
we have not kept pace with the cost of
 
01:35:51.719 --> 01:35:52.729 align:start position:0%
we have not kept pace with the cost of
living

01:35:52.729 --> 01:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
living
 
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
the way it was meant to be it was meant
 
01:35:57.410 --> 01:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
to be the floor for the basics and
 
01:35:59.090 --> 01:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
people at that time when minimum wage
 
01:36:02.209 --> 01:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
was created in America one parent could
 
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
have a job at say Sears or wherever and
 
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
they could
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
pay their mortgage get groceries
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
put clothes on their family all those
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
the basics
 
01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that's the what the
 
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
floor of a minimum wage is supposed to
 
01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
be about I'm sorry that I probably can't
 
01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
answer your question I will say though
 
01:36:27.169 --> 01:36:27.179 align:start position:0%
there is at the last part of the cola
 
01:36:27.179 --> 01:36:28.370 align:start position:0%
there is at the last part of the cola
section

01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
it does have an adjustment that says
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
um it shall not
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh re result in a decrease so if there
 
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
are years where Social Security because
 
01:36:42.649 --> 01:36:42.659 align:start position:0%
it's tied to the cola either way I
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
believe I'm not a social security
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
recipient it's there are years where it
 
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
goes down I believe I don't know for
 
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
sure but I wanted to make sure that the
 
01:36:54.490 --> 01:36:54.500 align:start position:0%
cola never went in the negative
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry that I know I
 
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
probably couldn't that was your question
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
the number was
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
I can get you more statistics on the
 
01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
cost of living though compared to what
 
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
it would be now from what the minimum
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
wage was and what it would be today I'm
 
01:37:11.209 --> 01:37:11.219 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have that in front of me I
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
used to know that by heart each year if
 
01:37:15.169 --> 01:37:15.179 align:start position:0%
you could do that that would be good
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
okay sure yeah
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:24.110 --> 01:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative colquin question
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
oh yes have you um
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
spoken with your constituents or the
 
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
businesses in your area about the um why
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
there are so many full-service gas
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
stations and why we are now seeing so
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
many automated cash registers and less
 
01:37:41.090 --> 01:37:41.100 align:start position:0%
and less people working at at um our
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
retail establishments
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
um so I see where you're going with your
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
question if we're able to automate some
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
of the jobs that we have that would
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
result in Less jobs being available I'm
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
not sure that that is a scarcity
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily people have faced
 
01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
um sectors of the economy disappearing
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
are the whole lifespan of our country I
 
01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
knew someone that made his many millions
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
because he
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
um had the cables did the cabling of
 
01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
America for cable television
 
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.139 align:start position:0%
um now that there's Wireless
 
01:38:19.139 --> 01:38:20.270 align:start position:0%
um now that there's Wireless
um

01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
internet and TV
 
01:38:24.410 --> 01:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
his business has gone under I'm pretty
 
01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:25.250 align:start position:0%
his business has gone under I'm pretty
sure

01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
but um I think there are sectors of the
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
economy that shift and that's why we
 
01:38:32.450 --> 01:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
have a number of um
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
I mean this is a growing economy there
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
will always be places where people could
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
shift I just feel like this bill is only
 
01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:42.659 align:start position:0%
about the wage piece but when we talk
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
about the bigger conversation around the
 
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
economy and jobs I would love to talk
 
01:38:48.649 --> 01:38:48.659 align:start position:0%
more about that
 
01:38:51.169 --> 01:38:51.179 align:start position:0%
could we have one final follow final
 
01:38:51.179 --> 01:38:52.310 align:start position:0%
could we have one final follow final
follow-up

01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry my question was have you
 
01:38:55.610 --> 01:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
spoken with your constituents on the
 
01:38:57.290 --> 01:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
retail establishments about why they
 
01:39:01.129 --> 01:39:01.139 align:start position:0%
have gone to an automated process
 
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
um that's an interesting no I haven't
 
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
spoken with anyone who has automated
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
their business per se
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
um but I do have those conversations
 
01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.050 align:start position:0%
um but I do have those conversations
with

01:39:12.050 --> 01:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
business owners and people in my
 
01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
district who work at businesses all the
 
01:39:20.689 --> 01:39:20.699 align:start position:0%
time in a subtle way in a non-nosy way I
 
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
usually just say so if I were to get a
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
job here what's the entry wage stuff
 
01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:39:28.850 --> 01:39:28.860 align:start position:0%
but that's an interesting question that
 
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
I can't answer really
 
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions I have one uh just
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
requested the sponsor for information
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
there is uh there is a network of
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
support for people who are low-wage
 
01:39:43.139 --> 01:39:44.030 align:start position:0%
support for people who are low-wage
workers

01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
and it would be good if you could
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
provide some member of this group could
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
provide some information to us relative
 
01:39:51.729 --> 01:39:51.739 align:start position:0%
to that support network
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh in the sense that low-wage workers
 
01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
need a lot more help and so if you have
 
01:39:59.530 --> 01:39:59.540 align:start position:0%
any information to support that to show
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
what it is that we are contributing now
 
01:40:05.209 --> 01:40:05.219 align:start position:0%
uh because many workers a low wage would
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
be helpful to them yes and I think we
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
can also get some of that information
 
01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
from companies like Walmart who do
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
instruct their employees how to go on
 
01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
assistance I mean there are a number of
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
organizations that help people who are
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
working in poor I'd be happy to to get
 
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
that information thank you
 
01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:23.209 align:start position:0%
that information thank you
and

01:40:23.209 --> 01:40:23.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
all right thank you that concludes all
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
the cards we had submitted for this bill
 
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
we are a bit behind so I will
 
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
close the hearing for HB 57 and
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
immediately launch into the hearing for
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
HB 58 which is prohibiting payment of
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
sub minimum wages at this point I only
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
have two cards for it I expect to see a
 
01:40:48.770 --> 01:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
couple more
 
01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:50.149 align:start position:0%
couple more
um

01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:53.219 align:start position:0%
no no we don't but
 
01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.490 --> 01:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry and uh
 
01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:06.659 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz is again the
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor for this bill and you are
 
01:41:11.450 --> 01:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
recognized to introduce your bill thank
 
01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and honorable labor
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
committee members I am still here
 
01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:17.030 align:start position:0%
committee members I am still here
um

01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
I'm glad we had a lot of the discussion
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
around tipped worker issues
 
01:41:24.169 --> 01:41:24.179 align:start position:0%
um on the previous bill and I think all
 
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
of us sat through that so that's helpful
 
01:41:29.689 --> 01:41:29.699 align:start position:0%
this bill would essentially eliminate
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
the sub minimum wage category especially
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
for tipped wage earners it does not get
 
01:41:40.850 --> 01:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
away or eliminate tipping
 
01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
uh tipping is it
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
something that workers have had access
 
01:41:50.689 --> 01:41:50.699 align:start position:0%
to in certain jobs for centuries across
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
the world
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
what this does do is make sure that the
 
01:41:58.609 --> 01:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
promise that all workers in restaurants
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
or other jobs that are tipped wage jobs
 
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
would actually get what they are
 
01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.149 align:start position:0%
would actually get what they are
promised

01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
promised
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
which is a minimum wage we've had a
 
01:42:10.010 --> 01:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
number of cases in this state that have
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
shown either through greed or confusion
 
01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
probably more confusion and
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding than anything nefarious
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
where restaurant owners employers did
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
not pay their workers what they're
 
01:42:25.370 --> 01:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
supposed to be paid
 
01:42:28.729 --> 01:42:28.739 align:start position:0%
um I think that we can look to the 11
 
01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
plus other states that have already
 
01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.790 align:start position:0%
plus other states that have already
eliminated

01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
the sub minimum wage category
 
01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
um to see that it has not at all hurt
 
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
their economy
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
um the CEO of the corporation that
 
01:42:45.890 --> 01:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
includes Denny's said on an investment
 
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
call that in the states at that point
 
01:42:50.530 --> 01:42:50.540 align:start position:0%
especially California
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
actually their business was up
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
um and that it had he did not see any
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
um problem with it in that regard I
 
01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
realized there will be folks that will
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
speak for the business community and say
 
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
otherwise but
 
01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
um really the intent of this bill is to
 
01:43:12.609 --> 01:43:12.619 align:start position:0%
eliminate the confusion and honestly
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
historically in America the notion of a
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
sub minimum wage started
 
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
um I hope this is helpful and not an eye
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
roll moment but it's true why we have
 
01:43:25.850 --> 01:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
Subway sub minimum wages in America is a
 
01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
Vestige of slavery after slavery ended
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
in America
 
01:43:31.970 --> 01:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
first the people who were formerly
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
enslaved were in jobs that depended on
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
the um the Gratitude the tips of the
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
people they were serving so uh Pullman
 
01:43:46.129 --> 01:43:46.139 align:start position:0%
car workers restaurant workers a number
 
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
of jobs that were in service to others
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
and so their entire wage was dependent
 
01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.669 align:start position:0%
and so their entire wage was dependent
on

01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
the graciousness of the customers and
 
01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
that was by Design
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
you know people who had
 
01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:02.629 align:start position:0%
you know people who had
um

01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
people who were previously enslaved uh
 
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
wanted it that way they wanted it to be
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
I hate to say it this way but it was
 
01:44:15.169 --> 01:44:15.179 align:start position:0%
true what the white people
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
um were okay with for that worker and
 
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
that is horrible
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
um and in all those years what is it 150
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
years we've gone from zero for sub
 
01:44:28.129 --> 01:44:28.139 align:start position:0%
minimum wage workers to in New Hampshire
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
three dollars and 27 cents an hour
 
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
in a logical sense it it just it
 
01:44:37.490 --> 01:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
genuinely makes no sense I get that
 
01:44:39.410 --> 01:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
that's what restaurant owners are used
 
01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:41.090 align:start position:0%
that's what restaurant owners are used
to

01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:43.129 --> 01:44:43.139 align:start position:0%
um I get that it's sort of a part of our
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
culture most people don't know the
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
history of sub minimum wages but in
 
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
those states that have done this it has
 
01:44:51.169 --> 01:44:51.179 align:start position:0%
not caused a problem for their economy
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's actually
 
01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
ensured that workers are paid what
 
01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be paid which by the
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
way is what workers really just want and
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
tips on top is fantastic and for some
 
01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:04.310 align:start position:0%
tips on top is fantastic and for some
restaurants

01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
servers bartenders even back of the
 
01:45:09.649 --> 01:45:09.659 align:start position:0%
house us boys
 
01:45:12.649 --> 01:45:12.659 align:start position:0%
um that was my first job as a my title
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
was busboy at a Chichi's restaurant on
 
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
Dixie Highway in Louisville but anyway
 
01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:20.450 align:start position:0%
Dixie Highway in Louisville but anyway
um

01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:23.689 --> 01:45:23.699 align:start position:0%
yes so for tipped wage workers all this
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
would essentially do and four of the
 
01:45:28.450 --> 01:45:28.460 align:start position:0%
owners of restaurants and any other
 
01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
establishment that has a tipped wage
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
category it would ensure that a minimum
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
wage is actually what is paid
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
um we again wouldn't be the first state
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
to do that so
 
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
um there were there is a segment of the
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
law and this is why there's an amendment
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
that went into some
 
01:45:51.169 --> 01:45:51.179 align:start position:0%
if you want to call them carve outs or
 
01:45:51.179 --> 01:45:52.970 align:start position:0%
if you want to call them carve outs or
exceptions

01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
um my the original bill which actually
 
01:45:58.370 --> 01:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
I'm I'd like but
 
01:45:59.870 --> 01:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
um would have gotten rid of all those
 
01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:02.090 align:start position:0%
um would have gotten rid of all those
categories

01:46:02.090 --> 01:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
categories
 
01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:03.590 align:start position:0%
categories
um

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
some who support this bill and I'm fine
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
with this I wanted to have that
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
discussion about those exceptions
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
possibly in another bill or just to
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
leave it alone and so that's what the
 
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
amendment does and I support the
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
amendment obviously I'm sponsoring it
 
01:46:21.649 --> 01:46:21.659 align:start position:0%
and so it would only keep the passage of
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
um eliminating a sub minimum wage
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
category and leaves those exceptions for
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
the ski patrol so you can get your ski
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
pass for the season that sort of job
 
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
would be exempt
 
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make that clear that
 
01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
this only simplifies the situation and
 
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I do have a
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
question you have stated both today and
 
01:46:52.970 --> 01:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
I've heard it before that you do not see
 
01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
this bill or something similar as a
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
substitute for tip wages
 
01:47:01.490 --> 01:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
I have heard other Advocates of this say
 
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
that that actually is their goal that
 
01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:05.149 align:start position:0%
that that actually is their goal that
they

01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:47:08.209 --> 01:47:08.219 align:start position:0%
feel that tipped wages are unfair and
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
the attempt is to eliminate it
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
how do you respond to that
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
um that is another debate
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
um for another bill I personally think
 
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
that it would be cool so that folks
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
aren't dependent on because especially
 
01:47:27.530 --> 01:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
now people are Moody me included you
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
know to depend on if someone likes that
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
you're wearing a mask or you're not
 
01:47:34.129 --> 01:47:34.139 align:start position:0%
wearing like all the things that might
 
01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
impact a tip I see the wisdom behind
 
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
just keeping it simple but that isn't in
 
01:47:44.649 --> 01:47:44.659 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm fine with tips and tipping
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to mess with the tips
 
01:47:48.729 --> 01:47:48.739 align:start position:0%
and tipping this is just about the base
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
bottom of the barrel wage
 
01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:58.729 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:47:58.729 --> 01:47:58.739 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
I just want to get a clarification of
 
01:48:04.490 --> 01:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
something and it relates to uh your
 
01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
suggesting that people are not getting
 
01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
the federal minimum wage in effect
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
everybody is required to get the federal
 
01:48:12.109 --> 01:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
minimum wage in the case of New
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh as I understand it and I'm
 
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
asking you for your interpretation of
 
01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
this is it the only difference when you
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
have a tip wage is to the employer uses
 
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
the tips to offset their responsibility
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
to the federal minimum wage is that
 
01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
correct I believe so thank you
 
01:48:32.450 --> 01:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
and so this would just ensure that all
 
01:48:34.490 --> 01:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
employers do it the same way by and
 
01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:35.510 align:start position:0%
employers do it the same way by and
large

01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
it simplifies law and again we have the
 
01:48:41.570 --> 01:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
example of 11 other States including
 
01:48:45.410 --> 01:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
such uh woke States like Utah and I
 
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
believe it's
 
01:48:50.570 --> 01:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
um Minnesota there are multiple States
 
01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:52.669 align:start position:0%
um Minnesota there are multiple States
um

01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
your point is well taken follow-up
 
01:48:58.129 --> 01:48:58.139 align:start position:0%
question so if the employer if the tips
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
are not enough
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
to get the employee to 725 an hour is
 
01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:05.219 align:start position:0%
the is the employer response be
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
responsible for the full 725 an hour
 
01:49:10.129 --> 01:49:10.139 align:start position:0%
they are supposed to be
 
01:49:12.649 --> 01:49:12.659 align:start position:0%
there some restaurants have good
 
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
guidance and I'm sure our lodging and
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Association helps with this
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
to explain how workers can be paid the
 
01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
proper amount but to say the wage is
 
01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
3.27 but you'll really make 7.25 an hour
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
is super confusing and we've had a
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
number of high profile cases in the
 
01:49:34.370 --> 01:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
state from the U.S Department of Labor
 
01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
saying these workers were not paid the
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
wage that they should be paid it's very
 
01:49:43.129 --> 01:49:43.139 align:start position:0%
confusing and makes no sense but to your
 
01:49:43.139 --> 01:49:44.450 align:start position:0%
confusing and makes no sense but to your
point

01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.609 --> 01:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
who are the questions
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testing
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
oh I did want to say if you don't mind
 
01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
Mr chair one more thing
 
01:49:57.649 --> 01:49:57.659 align:start position:0%
um in the previous testimony Maine was
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned and that there were so many
 
01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
servers that arrived to testify against
 
01:50:04.490 --> 01:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
and want to repeal it
 
01:50:06.649 --> 01:50:06.659 align:start position:0%
um we have surveyed New Hampshire
 
01:50:10.010 --> 01:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
restaurant workers a majority of New
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tipped wage workers would like
 
01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
to see this bill pass and as I
 
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
those restaurant workers by and large
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
were encouraged by their employer to go
 
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
or paid to go I believe
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
so while I get that people who are
 
01:50:31.729 --> 01:50:31.739 align:start position:0%
making good money at an expensive
 
01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
restaurant probably want to keep things
 
01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
the way they are
 
01:50:37.609 --> 01:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
we have to look at the entire industry
 
01:50:39.290 --> 01:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
so I I would say
 
01:50:44.330 --> 01:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
I would take exception to the to any
 
01:50:46.250 --> 01:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
argument that says this is what a
 
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
majority of restaurant workers in New
 
01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would not want because that
 
01:50:52.010 --> 01:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
simply is not the case I believe all
 
01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
workers want to at least be paid the
 
01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:55.250 align:start position:0%
workers want to at least be paid the
minimum

01:50:55.250 --> 01:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
01:50:57.770 --> 01:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
next I would like to ask representative
 
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
McWilliams a co-sponsor of the Bill of
 
01:51:06.169 --> 01:51:06.179 align:start position:0%
speaking in support uh signed up for two
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.370 --> 01:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you chair infantine for the record
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
my name is Rebecca McWilliams I am from
 
01:51:25.490 --> 01:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
South Concord I represent
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
boards five six seven eight and you're
 
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
currently sitting in one of my Wards so
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
welcome to my district it's a pleasure
 
01:51:33.410 --> 01:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
to host you
 
01:51:35.450 --> 01:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to testify on behalf of
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
removing the sub minimum wage altogether
 
01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
we've heard all kinds of discussion with
 
01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
the previous Bill and this bill about
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
how it seems as though the industry is
 
01:51:46.189 --> 01:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
changing at least in other states and
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity here to even
 
01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
things out I know that the tipped wage
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
is quite a discussion
 
01:51:55.129 --> 01:51:55.139 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to skirt around that and
 
01:51:57.169 --> 01:51:57.179 align:start position:0%
not get into restaurants and tipped wage
 
01:51:58.729 --> 01:51:58.739 align:start position:0%
I really want to talk about some of the
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
other folks who fall under these
 
01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
exceptions folks who are seasonal
 
01:52:04.370 --> 01:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
workers high schoolers folks in training
 
01:52:07.490 --> 01:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
for different labor positions I think
 
01:52:09.649 --> 01:52:09.659 align:start position:0%
that at this point the pendulum has
 
01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
swung so far back the economy has moved
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
forward and we're stuck at the federal
 
01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
minimum wage you know we've all
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
talked about how you can't live on it
 
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's barely enough to
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe buy a coffee once a week if
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
you feel like you're springing but
 
01:52:28.609 --> 01:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
you're not gonna be able to pay rent at
 
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage but nonetheless we have
 
01:52:33.590 --> 01:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
folks who are new to the workforce or
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's their first job and they do deserve
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
the Dignity of at least the federal
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and so I'm here just to
 
01:52:42.530 --> 01:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
testify and say that for
 
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
for too long we have allowed it to be
 
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
three quarters or half of the federal
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for some of these
 
01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:50.699 align:start position:0%
exceptions and I'd like to see that go
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
away and be fair and at least try to
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
base it on the federal minimum wage only
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
without exemption
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions thank you are
 
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again for your
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
um next I would call back Henry vayu
 
01:53:10.669 --> 01:53:10.679 align:start position:0%
he is speaking in opposition to the bill
 
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
and represents an hlra
 
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman again uh I'm Henry
 
01:53:17.810 --> 01:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
beyou on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
logic and Restaurant Association and we
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill this one is is
 
01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
quite a dramatic change we've seen bills
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
to adjust the tip wage but this one does
 
01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
away with it all together and would
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change uh the economics
 
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
and that the business model uh for
 
01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:42.109 align:start position:0%
and that the business model uh for
restaurants

01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
um and so we oppose it
 
01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
um again tip workers are the the highest
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
wage earners in the industry
 
01:53:54.169 --> 01:53:54.179 align:start position:0%
um we don't see the need for something
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
um and as I mentioned in Maine uh they
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
reversed uh what they did there
 
01:54:03.050 --> 01:54:03.060 align:start position:0%
um I spoke with
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
um one of the
 
01:54:07.629 --> 01:54:07.639 align:start position:0%
mid-sized restaurant operators yesterday
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
and he kind of shared some of his
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
numbers he said his current cost for
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
servers is and he has locations around
 
01:54:19.370 --> 01:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
the state is 1.4 million dollars and
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
01:54:24.609 --> 01:54:24.619 align:start position:0%
that cost would increase to 3.4 million
 
01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
and with the margins in the industry the
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
way they are you can't absorb all of
 
01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
that and it would reflect in menu prices
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
and menu prices would have to go up
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
quite a bit so that would be the effect
 
01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:40.070 align:start position:0%
of it
um

01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
and so we would oppose this I'm happy to
 
01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
answer questions I know we're coming up
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
on noon time thank you I see lots of
 
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Brewery
 
01:54:53.209 --> 01:54:53.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
you made a statement that right now it's
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
costing say a million dollars to someone
 
01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:00.659 align:start position:0%
and it's going to go to 3 million
 
01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
but you also said that the highest paid
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
people so if they're getting way more
 
01:55:07.370 --> 01:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
than minimum wage
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
where does that extra two million
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
dollars uh fit in here it seems like
 
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
they're already making that much well uh
 
01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
the cash wage from the employer right
 
01:55:19.129 --> 01:55:19.139 align:start position:0%
now is 327. so if you now require them
 
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
to pay the full minimum uh
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's more than double uh what
 
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
the current uh
 
01:55:30.649 --> 01:55:30.659 align:start position:0%
well look at least
 
01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
but they're really obligated to pay this
 
01:55:36.590 --> 01:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
the 7.25 and it's going to go to 13.50
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
so you're only talking about that window
 
01:55:40.729 --> 01:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
of increase
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
but the way you projected these people
 
01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
making so much more than minimum wage
 
01:55:49.729 --> 01:55:49.739 align:start position:0%
they're already making 15 or 20 dollars
 
01:55:51.169 --> 01:55:51.179 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
01:55:54.530 --> 01:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I was trying to uh explain from the
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
operator's standpoint the cost right now
 
01:56:00.649 --> 01:56:00.659 align:start position:0%
for the servers
 
01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:03.719 align:start position:0%
which is the 327 an hour
 
01:56:06.109 --> 01:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
and the difference
 
01:56:06.119 --> 01:56:06.950 align:start position:0%
and the difference
um

01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
under this bill which would do away with
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
that 327 it would then say you have to
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
pay the servers
 
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
well and under now would be 725
 
01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
so it's a difference between the 327
 
01:56:24.290 --> 01:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
in the 725 which is more than double or
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
60 percent of his staff
 
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:35.639 align:start position:0%
yes the from the employee side they're
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
making that correct but from the
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
employer's side
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:50.930 --> 01:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:53.330 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:56.090 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:56:56.090 --> 01:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
um I think we've heard uh in testimony
 
01:57:00.410 --> 01:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
in the previous Bill one thing that
 
01:57:03.070 --> 01:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
could happen in response to this
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
changing of how restaurant compensation
 
01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
is structured is that a restaurant could
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
choose to raise menu prices and prohibit
 
01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
tipping altogether
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
have you seen any other arrangements um
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
that would either be legal in the New
 
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law or common in other states
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
such as tip pooling or anything else
 
01:57:20.810 --> 01:57:20.820 align:start position:0%
that you would could would think that
 
01:57:23.689 --> 01:57:23.699 align:start position:0%
might be a response uh to this bill and
 
01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
how to restructure how both front of
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
house and backup house are are
 
01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:29.330 align:start position:0%
house and backup house are are
compensated

01:57:29.330 --> 01:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
compensated
 
01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so tip pooling tip sharing
 
01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:34.250 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so tip pooling tip sharing
that's

01:57:34.250 --> 01:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:57:37.129 --> 01:57:37.139 align:start position:0%
um it's a tricky issue
 
01:57:41.689 --> 01:57:41.699 align:start position:0%
I know uh the department uh the New
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor
 
01:57:46.010 --> 01:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
um play pays close attention to tip
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
pooling and tip sharing again tips are
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
the property of the employee
 
01:57:55.370 --> 01:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
and you can't you certainly can't share
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
the tips from the people in front of the
 
01:57:59.390 --> 01:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
house or the back of the house
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh or you you uh yeah you can't do it
 
01:58:05.450 --> 01:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
um to the property of the employee and
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
any tip pooling and tip sharing
 
01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
Arrangement has to be voluntary and uh
 
01:58:14.330 --> 01:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
so no one can be required to participate
 
01:58:16.850 --> 01:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
in one of those uh tip pooling tip
 
01:58:18.649 --> 01:58:18.659 align:start position:0%
sharing arrangements and there are
 
01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
employers that do get fined uh because
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
the department thinks the way they run
 
01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:24.550 align:start position:0%
the department thinks the way they run
theirs

01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
theirs
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
that crosses that line and so employers
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
have to be very careful with regards to
 
01:58:33.530 --> 01:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh tips because they are the property
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
01:58:37.609 --> 01:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
hold on follow-up
 
01:58:37.619 --> 01:58:38.390 align:start position:0%
hold on follow-up
um

01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
do you know if that's currently New
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law or federal law that
 
01:58:43.070 --> 01:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
prohibits to pulling from front of house
 
01:58:44.810 --> 01:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
tobacco house and do you think if it's
 
01:58:47.209 --> 01:58:47.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law there would be a push
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
to change that if the front of house and
 
01:58:51.169 --> 01:58:51.179 align:start position:0%
back of the house would make the same
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:56.570 --> 01:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
state law yeah
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
and second half do you think there would
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
be a push to change it if this went in
 
01:59:01.850 --> 01:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
this was passed
 
01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:02.570 align:start position:0%
this was passed
um

01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:05.089 --> 01:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
I don't know that the proponents of this
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
bill would push for that but I suspect
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
maybe the industry would I don't know
 
01:59:11.639 --> 01:59:12.649 align:start position:0%
maybe the industry would I don't know
um

01:59:12.649 --> 01:59:12.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
is making such a dramatic change like
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
this will probably result in other
 
01:59:20.930 --> 01:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
things happening exactly I think it's
 
01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to to point out is
 
01:59:25.010 --> 01:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be
 
01:59:30.770 --> 01:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:33.709 --> 01:59:33.719 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
01:59:33.719 --> 01:59:36.290 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
uh

01:59:36.290 --> 01:59:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
this is not gonna be easy in a pack but
 
01:59:39.770 --> 01:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
let me I have some questions relative to
 
01:59:41.810 --> 01:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
your to your numbers that you that you
 
01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
came up with suggesting that this is
 
01:59:46.129 --> 01:59:46.139 align:start position:0%
going to be a major increase for
 
01:59:46.139 --> 01:59:47.450 align:start position:0%
going to be a major increase for
employers

01:59:47.450 --> 01:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:59:51.169 --> 01:59:51.179 align:start position:0%
currently they pay 7.25 an hour
 
01:59:53.209 --> 01:59:53.219 align:start position:0%
um in the house whoever
 
01:59:55.250 --> 01:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
they have to meet that standard correct
 
01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:56.990 align:start position:0%
they have to meet that standard correct
so

01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
a restaurant operator to the tipped
 
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.129 align:start position:0%
a restaurant operator to the tipped
employees

02:00:01.129 --> 02:00:01.139 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
they give them the cash wage of 327 an
 
02:00:07.129 --> 02:00:07.139 align:start position:0%
hour yes the rest comes in tips
 
02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:10.860 align:start position:0%
so if you were to pass this bill instead
 
02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
of 327 an hour it would be 7.25 an hour
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
to all the service which represent and
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
this place was 60 percent of the the
 
02:00:19.679 --> 02:00:21.410 align:start position:0%
this place was 60 percent of the the
staff

02:00:21.410 --> 02:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up question so what is
 
02:00:27.290 --> 02:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
occurring is it uh some two million
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
dollars I think would you suggested that
 
02:00:33.890 --> 02:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
is actually the tips of the customers uh
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
that are going to offset the employer's
 
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility is that correct so it's a
 
02:00:40.850 --> 02:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
minimum wage so I think you're trying to
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
like color the wages uh when I say color
 
02:00:48.649 --> 02:00:48.659 align:start position:0%
the tips are red and the the the cash
 
02:00:50.689 --> 02:00:50.699 align:start position:0%
wage for the employer is blue and
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
somehow you know the the worker gets
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
some red dollars and blue dollars at the
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
end of the day I think the tip workers
 
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
like it the way it is because it's
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's tips or from the employer
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
they're still the highest paid
 
02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I answer your question
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
no no
 
02:01:13.970 --> 02:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
we could talk afterwards I think this is
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
an important Point Mr Mr chairman
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
that that uh that the wages the tipped
 
02:01:24.169 --> 02:01:24.179 align:start position:0%
the tips that employees receive
 
02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
go to offset the employer's
 
02:01:27.770 --> 02:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
responsibility towards the minimum wage
 
02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
is that correct uh you weren't
 
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
recognized for a follow-up on just to
 
02:01:36.010 --> 02:01:36.020 align:start position:0%
remind everyone we all have
 
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
the executive session to make our
 
02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
important points about these bills and
 
02:01:45.649 --> 02:01:45.659 align:start position:0%
uh I appreciate that you you've had some
 
02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
good questions but we we don't need to
 
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
engage Witnesses in a debate
 
02:01:53.570 --> 02:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you if you if you have a follow-up
 
02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
you are recognized for it
 
02:01:58.970 --> 02:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
I okay I'll repeat my question
 
02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:00.649 align:start position:0%
I okay I'll repeat my question
so

02:02:00.649 --> 02:02:00.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
um the minimum wage is 7.25. and I think
 
02:02:07.129 --> 02:02:07.139 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to say is that the
 
02:02:07.139 --> 02:02:08.470 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to say is that the
employer

02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:02:10.910 --> 02:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
because they're only paying the cash
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
wage of 327 they use the tips to offset
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
the 725 minimum that uh is re they're
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
required to pay either and uh yes thank
 
02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:25.250 align:start position:0%
required to pay either and uh yes thank
you

02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:26.689 align:start position:0%
you
um

02:02:26.689 --> 02:02:26.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
I'll go around this way and then come
 
02:02:31.250 --> 02:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
back representative
 
02:02:33.770 --> 02:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
I I wanted to go around this in the
 
02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
whole room man
 
02:02:38.209 --> 02:02:38.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you rep uh
 
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
Mr vayu for being here for us
 
02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:46.129 align:start position:0%
Mr vayu for being here for us
um

02:02:46.129 --> 02:02:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:48.890 --> 02:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
the difference between the tip wage and
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
a 725
 
02:02:54.589 --> 02:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
is we pay the taxes and insurance and
 
02:02:56.570 --> 02:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
everything else that accumulates for
 
02:02:59.689 --> 02:02:59.699 align:start position:0%
that 327 to be paid to the employee if
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
we were now required to pay 7.25 we
 
02:03:05.890 --> 02:03:05.900 align:start position:0%
would have to do a obviously a match of
 
02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:07.870 align:start position:0%
would have to do a obviously a match of
withholdings

02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
withholdings
 
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
workman's compensation uh possible
 
02:03:12.890 --> 02:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
increase in other insurance areas
 
02:03:14.450 --> 02:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
whether it be short-term disability
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
long-term disability things like that
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
um so I think that the
 
02:03:21.770 --> 02:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
way it has been interpreted as that tips
 
02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
offset those wages but the employer is
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying the initial cost
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
for those wages which in your example
 
02:03:32.089 --> 02:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
would increase the cost the base cost of
 
02:03:34.850 --> 02:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
the employer exactly thank you thank you
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative Mason thank you for
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you
 
02:03:46.010 --> 02:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
um could you tell me do you know of
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
other states that
 
02:03:49.609 --> 02:03:49.619 align:start position:0%
go to a minimum wage or that they all
 
02:03:51.169 --> 02:03:51.179 align:start position:0%
have a reduced wage for restaurant
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
workers uh the majority of states the
 
02:03:57.169 --> 02:03:57.179 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority uh I have a
 
02:03:59.330 --> 02:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
minimum and for servers there's a
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
could I follow oh yes so
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
I'm struggling a little bit with this I
 
02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
mean I just
 
02:04:13.250 --> 02:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
shake it on an airplane and you fly
 
02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:14.270 align:start position:0%
shake it on an airplane and you fly
somewhere

02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
the POS systems today
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
they have recommended tips and this and
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
that so if you had special
 
02:04:24.169 --> 02:04:24.179 align:start position:0%
something different where the wages of
 
02:04:25.370 --> 02:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
it would have created a problem where
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
people just wouldn't know how much to
 
02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:27.950 align:start position:0%
people just wouldn't know how much to
tip

02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
tip
 
02:04:30.169 --> 02:04:30.179 align:start position:0%
if the wages were added to their food
 
02:04:30.179 --> 02:04:31.669 align:start position:0%
if the wages were added to their food
prices

02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
prices
 
02:04:35.629 --> 02:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
uh well I mean that would no I think
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
people would well what would be the
 
02:04:41.810 --> 02:04:41.820 align:start position:0%
result of uh this bill
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh requiring the full minimum to the
 
02:04:46.609 --> 02:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
servers uh
 
02:04:49.010 --> 02:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
menu prices would increase dramatically
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
and what would be the result of that
 
02:04:51.719 --> 02:04:52.729 align:start position:0%
and what would be the result of that
um

02:04:52.729 --> 02:04:52.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
you know it'll probably would be mixed
 
02:04:56.810 --> 02:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
maybe there would be some that would
 
02:04:59.450 --> 02:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
still continue to tip at the same level
 
02:05:01.729 --> 02:05:01.739 align:start position:0%
there'd probably be some low-wage
 
02:05:03.770 --> 02:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
workers that now the price of the meal
 
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
increase so much they can't tip as much
 
02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:07.970 align:start position:0%
increase so much they can't tip as much
um

02:05:07.970 --> 02:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:10.370 --> 02:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
maybe some people wouldn't go out as
 
02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
much because they can
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
um so it would have a variety of effect
 
02:05:14.639 --> 02:05:16.189 align:start position:0%
um so it would have a variety of effect
yeah

02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:20.270 --> 02:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:21.310 align:start position:0%
any further questions
yes

02:05:21.310 --> 02:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I do tip so generally
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
do tipped workers work harder or do they
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.649 --> 02:05:33.659 align:start position:0%
is that just a general State uh they
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
they look tip workers are the most
 
02:05:38.810 --> 02:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
valued uh workers in the industry
 
02:05:41.209 --> 02:05:41.219 align:start position:0%
because they're the face of the and
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
they're they're interacting with the
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
customers uh uh they work hard they're
 
02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
valued and that's probably why they're
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
the highest pain
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:55.070 --> 02:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:56.870 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
proud

02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
proud
 
02:05:58.250 --> 02:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:00.530 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:06:00.530 --> 02:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:02.209 --> 02:06:02.219 align:start position:0%
the other member's question about the
 
02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
point of sales is another display a
 
02:06:05.570 --> 02:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
recommended tip made me think of
 
02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
something would you knows whether it be
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
anything in existing law that prohibits
 
02:06:11.149 --> 02:06:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh restaurants for example from charging
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
a 10 service fee and then also
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
recommending a tip of 10 using that
 
02:06:18.770 --> 02:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
service fee to make up the difference in
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
the uh new higher minimum wage they have
 
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
to pay and acknowledging that in
 
02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
recommending a lower tip and using that
 
02:06:30.530 --> 02:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:34.129 --> 02:06:34.139 align:start position:0%
I'm not I I don't know that I can answer
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
that okay yeah
 
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:06:42.770 --> 02:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:06:45.410 --> 02:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
um next up I would like a representative
 
02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:46.609 align:start position:0%
um next up I would like a representative
Staub

02:06:46.609 --> 02:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
Staub
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
who is a co-sponsor of this bill
 
02:06:51.229 --> 02:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
obviously in support and has asked for
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
02:07:01.129 --> 02:07:01.139 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
um uh I hadn't planned to speak but let
 
02:07:07.550 --> 02:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
me just say that I've been and doing a
 
02:07:09.950 --> 02:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of research while folks have
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
been talking the tipped wage in Maine is
 
02:07:16.910 --> 02:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
6.90 would be which is
 
02:07:20.330 --> 02:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
um just 35 cents less than what what
 
02:07:23.089 --> 02:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
this bill would would do and in
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's 8.25 cents and in
 
02:07:29.149 --> 02:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
Vermont it's 6.59 and in New Hampshire
 
02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
it's 3.27
 
02:07:37.070 --> 02:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
also I would like to expand the um
 
02:07:39.070 --> 02:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
um scope Beyond restaurant workers
 
02:07:41.770 --> 02:07:41.780 align:start position:0%
hairdressers are also
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
tipped workers they get paid 3.27 cents
 
02:07:48.290 --> 02:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
an hour a number of years ago I spoke to
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
an elderly woman who lived in Kittery
 
02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
Maine and she was in her 80s but she
 
02:07:54.649 --> 02:07:54.659 align:start position:0%
still liked it to work as a hairdresser
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
and they would call her in to one of
 
02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
these chain hairdressing salons so she
 
02:08:02.330 --> 02:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
said yeah and when I get called to work
 
02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth if nobody comes in they
 
02:08:07.370 --> 02:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
pay me 7.25 cents an hour this was a
 
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
number of years ago she says but if I
 
02:08:11.089 --> 02:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
get to work in Maine I get paid nine
 
02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour so um you know if nobody
 
02:08:17.930 --> 02:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
comes in then you get paid the the
 
02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
minimum wage I think the other thing
 
02:08:23.810 --> 02:08:23.820 align:start position:0%
which I'm not 100 sure about but
 
02:08:25.790 --> 02:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
um I would invite you to investigate
 
02:08:28.189 --> 02:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
this is I believe you can
 
02:08:28.199 --> 02:08:29.390 align:start position:0%
this is I believe you can
um

02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:31.970 --> 02:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
um average so for example if someone
 
02:08:34.129 --> 02:08:34.139 align:start position:0%
comes in and has a really good shift and
 
02:08:36.410 --> 02:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
they make you know thirty dollars an
 
02:08:38.570 --> 02:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
hour for their shift and they come in
 
02:08:40.129 --> 02:08:40.139 align:start position:0%
the following day and nobody's there and
 
02:08:41.410 --> 02:08:41.420 align:start position:0%
they spend it
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
rolling silverware or you know sweeping
 
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
the floor in the bathroom or you know
 
02:08:51.649 --> 02:08:51.659 align:start position:0%
doing little menial tasks
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and and they don't make any money
 
02:08:55.370 --> 02:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
nobody comes in then you can average
 
02:08:57.649 --> 02:08:57.659 align:start position:0%
over those two days so they don't have
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
to pay the the 7.25 cents an hour for
 
02:09:03.050 --> 02:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
that day of work
 
02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:03.890 align:start position:0%
that day of work
um

02:09:03.890 --> 02:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:06.589 --> 02:09:06.599 align:start position:0%
so I just you know I just wanted to take
 
02:09:09.169 --> 02:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to answer some questions
 
02:09:12.169 --> 02:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
there are eight states that um do not
 
02:09:14.209 --> 02:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
have a sub minimum wage for restaurant
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
workers and their California Minnesota
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
Montana Nevada Oregon Washington and
 
02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:21.649 align:start position:0%
Montana Nevada Oregon Washington and
Alaska

02:09:21.649 --> 02:09:21.659 align:start position:0%
Alaska
 
02:09:24.169 --> 02:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
oh and one more I
 
02:09:25.550 --> 02:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
but there are a number of states that
 
02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
are on track to get rid of the tipped
 
02:09:30.290 --> 02:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
minimum wage as well
 
02:09:33.770 --> 02:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:09:39.770 --> 02:09:39.780 align:start position:0%
next I would ask Stephen nass from the
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
Free State Food Network who was speaking
 
02:09:43.970 --> 02:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
in opposition for the bill
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
signed up for one minute
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll be very brief um I've
 
02:09:51.649 --> 02:09:51.659 align:start position:0%
already stated that I believe that
 
02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
workers in the state would not support
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
this bill and I find it really odd uh
 
02:09:58.729 --> 02:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
that somehow I've made it through my
 
02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
whole career without working with
 
02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
servers that want to do away with
 
02:10:05.629 --> 02:10:05.639 align:start position:0%
tipping but I did want to bring up uh
 
02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
somebody uh
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
a previous speaker made some points
 
02:10:14.570 --> 02:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
about uh businesses like Denny's and
 
02:10:15.649 --> 02:10:15.659 align:start position:0%
they might have mentioned some other
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
ones uh
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
finding it more profitable to do away
 
02:10:23.390 --> 02:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
with tipping in the states where they
 
02:10:25.010 --> 02:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
they were forced to do away with tipping
 
02:10:28.189 --> 02:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
and uh I would just like to make the
 
02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
point uh that
 
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
these big corporations like this would
 
02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
not be in favor of voluntarily getting
 
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
rid of tipping or they would already do
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
it but they are in favor of the playing
 
02:10:43.970 --> 02:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
field for everybody being leveled like
 
02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
that because they can as massive
 
02:10:50.089 --> 02:10:50.099 align:start position:0%
franchises can more easily absorb those
 
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
costs versus their competitors the small
 
02:10:54.169 --> 02:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
businesses which a previous speaker
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
spoke about they love the fact that New
 
02:10:58.850 --> 02:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has many small businesses and
 
02:11:00.050 --> 02:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
we're really thriving in that way
 
02:11:01.870 --> 02:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
compared to some other states
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
these big corporations would love for a
 
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
bill like this to take place so that a
 
02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
huge burden is placed on themselves but
 
02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
also all of their competitors and their
 
02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
competitors would be unable to absorb it
 
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
so we would see in our state uh what
 
02:11:20.089 --> 02:11:20.099 align:start position:0%
would happen would be like what happened
 
02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
with Walmart and all their competitors
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
were Walmart can drastically drop their
 
02:11:27.229 --> 02:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
prices their competitors go out of
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
business Walmart takes that market share
 
02:11:32.089 --> 02:11:32.099 align:start position:0%
and take takes over and then now you
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
don't have any competitors anymore I
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't think I personally want to live in
 
02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
a state where uh we drive all of our
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
small businesses under and then we're
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
just left with the Denny's the
 
02:11:46.850 --> 02:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
Applebee's the TGI Fridays Etc I'd much
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
rather uh keep the tipped wage which
 
02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
allows the small businesses to be
 
02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
competitive with the larger corporations
 
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:58.970 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
questions

02:11:58.970 --> 02:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
02:12:03.890 --> 02:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question was was
 
02:12:05.629 --> 02:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
it your understanding that this bill
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
does away with tips
 
02:12:10.370 --> 02:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh well it it dramatically affects it
 
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
does it not uh it's we're discussing the
 
02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
payment of sub minimum wages so any
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
anything that's uh removing the ability
 
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
and interfering with the ability of
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
small businesses to decide their own
 
02:12:26.510 --> 02:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
wages uh is going to have that effect of
 
02:12:29.209 --> 02:12:29.219 align:start position:0%
making them anti-competitive
 
02:12:29.219 --> 02:12:31.070 align:start position:0%
making them anti-competitive
oh

02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that this bill
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
does away with tipping
 
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh that is not my understanding thank
 
02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:38.930 align:start position:0%
uh that is not my understanding thank
you

02:12:38.930 --> 02:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:12:43.490 --> 02:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again for your
 
02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:44.810 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again for your
testimony

02:12:44.810 --> 02:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm down to two cards
 
02:12:50.330 --> 02:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
and so representative baroody if you
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
could get the um blue sheets for 57 and
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
58 and pass them forward while we wrap
 
02:12:57.649 --> 02:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
things up here I would call
 
02:13:02.089 --> 02:13:02.099 align:start position:0%
Representative Horrigan who is
 
02:13:02.099 --> 02:13:03.350 align:start position:0%
Representative Horrigan who is
uh

02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:06.109 --> 02:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
uh speaking in support of the bill for
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
two minutes
 
02:13:10.609 --> 02:13:10.619 align:start position:0%
I was glad the uh I'm president Timothy
 
02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
Horrigan for Stratford County District
 
02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
10 which is the town of Durham
 
02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and we do have a number of
 
02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
independent restaurants in town
 
02:13:23.689 --> 02:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
um I I I would uh I would disagree that
 
02:13:25.970 --> 02:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
this I've read the previous uh witness
 
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that it doesn't eliminate
 
02:13:30.890 --> 02:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
tipping um there's
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
um I think there is still a you're still
 
02:13:36.169 --> 02:13:36.179 align:start position:0%
a little tip it's just the uh lower just
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
like the floor that's guaranteed by the
 
02:13:39.290 --> 02:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
employer would be hired I don't think
 
02:13:42.890 --> 02:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
that would uh drastically drastically
 
02:13:44.930 --> 02:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
increased menu prices and I'm not even
 
02:13:46.729 --> 02:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
sure increasing many prices is that
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
terrible the catastrophe and if
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
if indeed the servers are the highest
 
02:13:52.609 --> 02:13:52.619 align:start position:0%
paid people in the restaurant business
 
02:13:55.010 --> 02:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
because they're the public-facing side
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:13:58.550 --> 02:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
um that would make that industry
 
02:14:00.770 --> 02:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
somewhat unique that's not how most uh
 
02:14:02.330 --> 02:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
Industries in our capitalist Society
 
02:14:03.770 --> 02:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
work usually the people at the front
 
02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
lines are the the lowest paid
 
02:14:07.970 --> 02:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
the previous windows also mentioned
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
Walmart and earlier today we heard about
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh about Sears once Sears was a a
 
02:14:17.569 --> 02:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
Goliath that dominated the retail
 
02:14:19.370 --> 02:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
Industries I'm sure
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
Walmart will eventually go the way of a
 
02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
way of Sears and other retail goliaths
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody else will take its place
 
02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
so it
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you well while Mart was
 
02:14:33.530 --> 02:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned in this bill so that's um
 
02:14:36.589 --> 02:14:36.599 align:start position:0%
and actually the another point which I
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
haven't been mostly hearing but it's
 
02:14:41.089 --> 02:14:41.099 align:start position:0%
probably hasn't been taken up much is uh
 
02:14:42.890 --> 02:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
sub minimum wages for example with
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities I
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
I think um I think those
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh they're if they if they're not worth
 
02:14:53.569 --> 02:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage I can understand why
 
02:14:55.550 --> 02:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
you have them coming in and doing tasks
 
02:14:57.229 --> 02:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
but they should not be asked to
 
02:14:59.209 --> 02:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
subsidize their jobs that should be done
 
02:15:00.890 --> 02:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
by uh someone else and they should be
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
guaranteed the minimum wage for their uh
 
02:15:05.450 --> 02:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
for their efforts so
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
I urge you to uh
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
okay I've heard that while I was already
 
02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
fixed so there's an amendment coming in
 
02:15:13.609 --> 02:15:13.619 align:start position:0%
so that's but
 
02:15:16.669 --> 02:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support this bill um and
 
02:15:18.649 --> 02:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
higher wages are not a bad thing anyway
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
so thanks
 
02:15:22.010 --> 02:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:24.050 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
questions

02:15:24.050 --> 02:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:15:27.050 --> 02:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again uh last up
 
02:15:29.689 --> 02:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
and if I get this wrong again I'm sorry
 
02:15:33.069 --> 02:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you maybe I'll remember it if
 
02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
next time
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
to throw people off aftc in support of
 
02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
the bill two minutes yes so thank you so
 
02:15:44.410 --> 02:15:44.420 align:start position:0%
much I wasn't originally intending to
 
02:15:46.669 --> 02:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
testify but I just wanted to share
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
another story so I appreciate your
 
02:15:51.290 --> 02:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
Indulgence and your time um in hearing
 
02:15:54.109 --> 02:15:54.119 align:start position:0%
me today uh so the first restaurant job
 
02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
I ever had in New Hampshire was a little
 
02:15:58.430 --> 02:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
place called new dad hang restaurant it
 
02:16:00.350 --> 02:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
was a Chinese restaurant that was owned
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
by a Chinese couple that had come to the
 
02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
United States because of the one child
 
02:16:07.129 --> 02:16:07.139 align:start position:0%
policy Rule and so in order to keep
 
02:16:10.790 --> 02:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
their youngest daughter they moved here
 
02:16:12.410 --> 02:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
they picked up their whole family and
 
02:16:14.689 --> 02:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
they moved here and raised their family
 
02:16:16.490 --> 02:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
their children here and they opened the
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
restaurant in Goffstown in Pinardville
 
02:16:22.669 --> 02:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
that was a local favorite and they hired
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
me at 16 years old with no experience in
 
02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
restaurants I'd been doing mostly child
 
02:16:30.169 --> 02:16:30.179 align:start position:0%
care and nannying at that point they
 
02:16:32.690 --> 02:16:32.700 align:start position:0%
hired me and they started me off this is
 
02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
I was 16 years old I graduated in 2005
 
02:16:38.929 --> 02:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
that was 2003 I want to say they started
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
me off at seven dollars an hour and they
 
02:16:43.490 --> 02:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
increased my wage progressively up to
 
02:16:45.889 --> 02:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
ten dollars an hour and they continued
 
02:16:49.549 --> 02:16:49.559 align:start position:0%
to allow me to take and earn tips on top
 
02:16:52.190 --> 02:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
of that base wage and so I am in support
 
02:16:54.530 --> 02:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
of this bill because if an immigrant
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
couple owning a restaurant in this state
 
02:17:00.290 --> 02:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
who have very little and are working on
 
02:17:02.089 --> 02:17:02.099 align:start position:0%
the thin margins and I know they're not
 
02:17:04.910 --> 02:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
the only example of restaurant owners
 
02:17:08.990 --> 02:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
business owners who are in good you know
 
02:17:10.310 --> 02:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
have a good relationship with their
 
02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
employees are trying to do the best that
 
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
they can to provide their employees and
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
we were a small restaurant we were a
 
02:17:18.589 --> 02:17:18.599 align:start position:0%
staff of four people two people in the
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
back of the house one per person that
 
02:17:22.370 --> 02:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
was me who ran back and forth from the
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
front of the house to the back of the
 
02:17:26.110 --> 02:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
house and our driver Fred who was great
 
02:17:30.049 --> 02:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
and so if they could manage to pay me
 
02:17:33.589 --> 02:17:33.599 align:start position:0%
and Fred and anyone else that they would
 
02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
hire seasonally for the very very busy
 
02:17:38.509 --> 02:17:38.519 align:start position:0%
periods at minimum ten dollars an hour
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
plus tips I think that there is no
 
02:17:44.450 --> 02:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
reason why this committee and why this
 
02:17:46.509 --> 02:17:46.519 align:start position:0%
state in the year of Our Lord
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
2023 cannot increase the base sub
 
02:17:52.969 --> 02:17:52.979 align:start position:0%
minimum wage to be at the very minimum
 
02:17:55.490 --> 02:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
to meet the federal standard it does not
 
02:17:58.009 --> 02:17:58.019 align:start position:0%
do away with tips our tipped workers
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
would still be able to be able to earn
 
02:18:02.750 --> 02:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
those tips that is not the issue
 
02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:04.549 align:start position:0%
those tips that is not the issue
employers

02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
employers
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
across the state are willing to do this
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately they're not here and
 
02:18:12.110 --> 02:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
that's good to know it's good for us to
 
02:18:13.610 --> 02:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
recognize that we need to be bringing
 
02:18:16.009 --> 02:18:16.019 align:start position:0%
more of those base those voices into
 
02:18:18.969 --> 02:18:18.979 align:start position:0%
this space but my hope is that my story
 
02:18:21.049 --> 02:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this is already
 
02:18:23.150 --> 02:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
happening and we can do this so please
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass on HB 57
 
02:18:28.910 --> 02:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you that was my last
 
02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
card for this bill
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
so before I close the hearing we had a
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
number of people signed the blue sheets
 
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
for HB 57 the first one there were 19 in
 
02:18:47.450 --> 02:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
favor and three opposed for HB 58 there
 
02:18:50.450 --> 02:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
were 18 in favor and one opposed I would
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
remind both the committee and anyone
 
02:18:55.969 --> 02:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
watching that we also now have online
 
02:18:59.570 --> 02:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
signups and online testimony so
 
02:19:02.570 --> 02:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
um that is open throughout the day so
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
that can keep coming in and that's
 
02:19:07.250 --> 02:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
something that can be checked online
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll close the hearing for
 
02:19:14.450 --> 02:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
HB 58 we are now into our lunch time uh
 
02:19:17.570 --> 02:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
hopefully 40 minutes is plenty of time
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
for everybody and we can be back here
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
promptly at one to pick up on our next
 
02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:22.969 align:start position:0%
promptly at one to pick up on our next
hearing

02:19:22.969 --> 02:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments before we
 
02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:29.990 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments before we
leave

02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:31.730 --> 02:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
ah yes
 
02:19:33.410 --> 02:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone see you at one
 
02:19:33.420 --> 03:07:17.990 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone see you at one
o'clock

03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:20.630 --> 03:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
if everybody could head to their seats
 
03:07:23.389 --> 03:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
we're a couple minutes behind but
 
03:07:33.290 --> 03:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:36.469 --> 03:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:38.990 --> 03:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill having arrived we
 
03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:51.070 --> 03:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
so before before I start uh
 
03:07:54.290 --> 03:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan hopefully
 
03:07:56.929 --> 03:07:56.939 align:start position:0%
um asked for a current printout of the
 
03:08:00.889 --> 03:08:00.899 align:start position:0%
online remote testimony and sign-ins so
 
03:08:03.290 --> 03:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
I would just like to for the two bills
 
03:08:06.769 --> 03:08:06.779 align:start position:0%
that I read the blue sheets for
 
03:08:13.190 --> 03:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
um HB 57 had 152 in support five opposed
 
03:08:17.349 --> 03:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:22.370 --> 03:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
had 79 in support and three opposed and
 
03:08:25.429 --> 03:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
I will save the other ones until we get
 
03:08:28.429 --> 03:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
to those bills
 
03:08:30.590 --> 03:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
um with that I will open the public
 
03:08:33.010 --> 03:08:33.020 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
03:08:36.710 --> 03:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
HB 48 which is relative to employee
 
03:08:39.230 --> 03:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
protections from covid-19 in the
 
03:08:42.410 --> 03:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
workplace and I would ask the prime
 
03:08:45.050 --> 03:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Horrigan
 
03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
to introduce his Bill thank you thank
 
03:08:50.990 --> 03:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
you very much and um I'm I was supposed
 
03:08:52.910 --> 03:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
to be in three places at one time at one
 
03:08:55.610 --> 03:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
but um my own committee is running half
 
03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
an hour behind education is running
 
03:08:59.330 --> 03:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
about 15 minutes behind so
 
03:09:01.849 --> 03:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
you're pretty much on time so hopefully
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
it'll all work out
 
03:09:05.330 --> 03:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
um how many is there is it just the one
 
03:09:07.010 --> 03:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
pink card aside from mine are there
 
03:09:07.020 --> 03:09:08.630 align:start position:0%
pink card aside from mine are there
others

03:09:08.630 --> 03:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
others
 
03:09:10.490 --> 03:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
sorry right now I have two pink cards
 
03:09:10.500 --> 03:09:11.690 align:start position:0%
sorry right now I have two pink cards
okay

03:09:11.690 --> 03:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:09:16.010 --> 03:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
all right cool anyway so it's uh
 
03:09:17.330 --> 03:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
um it's a
 
03:09:19.610 --> 03:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
pretty simple bill you actually except
 
03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
for the effective date is identical to
 
03:09:23.330 --> 03:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
what you had last year and that one
 
03:09:25.070 --> 03:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of anti-vax bills and
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a flip side of it so
 
03:09:29.269 --> 03:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much silver 19 the right to
 
03:09:32.990 --> 03:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
use personal protective equipment such
 
03:09:35.150 --> 03:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
as face Shields and face masks while
 
03:09:36.710 --> 03:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
employed in the workplace no employers
 
03:09:38.090 --> 03:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
shall discriminate in any way against
 
03:09:40.389 --> 03:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
employee based on you know the employee
 
03:09:43.309 --> 03:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
exercising his or her rights um
 
03:09:45.170 --> 03:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
and my intention would also
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if this covers it or
 
03:09:49.070 --> 03:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
not but also be to forbid you know
 
03:09:51.650 --> 03:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
discrimination and hiring uh based on
 
03:09:55.610 --> 03:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
somebody being uh being vaccinated I um
 
03:09:57.290 --> 03:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
so your employer would not be able to
 
03:09:58.790 --> 03:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
fire you to discriminate you in any way
 
03:10:00.110 --> 03:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
if you choose to get vaccinated against
 
03:10:02.929 --> 03:10:02.939 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and I'll say um
 
03:10:05.450 --> 03:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
even though uh I'm not wearing a mask
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
and none of us are it's still very much
 
03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
a concern the pandemic is still going um
 
03:10:13.550 --> 03:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
a million people died in China just just
 
03:10:15.710 --> 03:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
in the uh last month or two after
 
03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
McCarthy that's because they changed
 
03:10:19.610 --> 03:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
their approach to covet but um
 
03:10:21.650 --> 03:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
and they also can't stop you wearing
 
03:10:21.660 --> 03:10:22.969 align:start position:0%
and they also can't stop you wearing
ppes

03:10:22.969 --> 03:10:22.979 align:start position:0%
ppes
 
03:10:24.889 --> 03:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
um this is I think this disease is still
 
03:10:26.990 --> 03:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
running rampant it's killed over 1.1
 
03:10:29.750 --> 03:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
million Americans and that's uh
 
03:10:31.550 --> 03:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
that's one of the greatest catastrophes
 
03:10:34.130 --> 03:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
in in the history of our country in fact
 
03:10:36.410 --> 03:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
I think it is the biggest in terms of uh
 
03:10:39.410 --> 03:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
the gross number of people and
 
03:10:41.690 --> 03:10:41.700 align:start position:0%
um they're actually and um there
 
03:10:43.130 --> 03:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
actually has been a
 
03:10:45.950 --> 03:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
excess number of deaths and those deaths
 
03:10:48.050 --> 03:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
have been due to uh very specifically
 
03:10:51.050 --> 03:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
the respiratory disease I.E covid-19 and
 
03:10:52.910 --> 03:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
not to any other causes that have been
 
03:10:54.889 --> 03:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
uh theorized for it
 
03:10:56.450 --> 03:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
now I frankly
 
03:10:57.769 --> 03:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
don't know of any New Hampshire
 
03:11:00.650 --> 03:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
employees of outright banned vaccines in
 
03:11:02.990 --> 03:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
the workplace I did see one
 
03:11:06.230 --> 03:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
I did see one uh online ad
 
03:11:08.030 --> 03:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
um for I think it was like a business in
 
03:11:09.769 --> 03:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
Manchester starting Casino which said
 
03:11:12.590 --> 03:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
they're uh hosts and hostesses couldn't
 
03:11:15.170 --> 03:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated but that's uh
 
03:11:17.030 --> 03:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
but that could just be one isolated
 
03:11:18.830 --> 03:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
incident but uh
 
03:11:22.309 --> 03:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
I know during the 2021 shutdown and the
 
03:11:25.309 --> 03:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
economic chaos that followed
 
03:11:27.950 --> 03:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
a number of businesses uh shut down and
 
03:11:29.750 --> 03:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
some of them did specifically cite to
 
03:11:31.730 --> 03:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
ppes and the mass mandates just one of
 
03:11:32.929 --> 03:11:32.939 align:start position:0%
the reasons why they shut down their
 
03:11:35.690 --> 03:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
business so they did um
 
03:11:37.070 --> 03:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
the probably other reasons why they
 
03:11:38.630 --> 03:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
chose to shut down their business but a
 
03:11:40.849 --> 03:11:40.859 align:start position:0%
number of business people did cite that
 
03:11:42.469 --> 03:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
as a specific reason why they didn't
 
03:11:44.269 --> 03:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
want to continue keeping the doors open
 
03:11:47.030 --> 03:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
on their business so
 
03:11:49.130 --> 03:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
and um so I've got several assumptions
 
03:11:50.210 --> 03:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
here which
 
03:11:51.889 --> 03:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
I think they're pretty widely accepting
 
03:11:53.330 --> 03:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
the outside world but somewhere where
 
03:11:54.769 --> 03:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
controvers here in the State House one
 
03:11:57.170 --> 03:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
is I said the covid-19 pandemic is one
 
03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
of the worst catastrophes in human
 
03:12:02.510 --> 03:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
history and um it's still going on
 
03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
um the vaccines I think they're well
 
03:12:06.650 --> 03:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
worth taking they're not 100 effective
 
03:12:08.809 --> 03:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
or 100 safe but they're they're very
 
03:12:10.490 --> 03:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
effective and very safe
 
03:12:12.670 --> 03:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
um specific especially the
 
03:12:15.349 --> 03:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
three vaccines here and put down a
 
03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
Pfizer and the chance of vaccine they're
 
03:12:20.389 --> 03:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
all safe and effective they've been uh
 
03:12:22.190 --> 03:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
they've been adequately tested the
 
03:12:24.170 --> 03:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
process worked well in those cases um
 
03:12:25.790 --> 03:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
and I actually followed that during the
 
03:12:27.830 --> 03:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic I got to I
 
03:12:29.929 --> 03:12:29.939 align:start position:0%
dear my free time that's what I did to
 
03:12:31.610 --> 03:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
watch a lot of the webinars about it um
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
and I do think the vaccines they make
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
you less susceptible to covid-19 virus
 
03:12:36.950 --> 03:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
and also less likely to spread it to
 
03:12:38.510 --> 03:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
others um
 
03:12:40.670 --> 03:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
also the ppe's are worthwhile even not
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
100 effective the same goes for the drug
 
03:12:45.769 --> 03:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
treatments such as paxilovid which I
 
03:12:48.610 --> 03:12:48.620 align:start position:0%
I'll say parenthetically actually cut uh
 
03:12:51.469 --> 03:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
covid uh this summer and it was uh
 
03:12:53.809 --> 03:12:53.819 align:start position:0%
obviously I didn't die but I did take
 
03:12:55.190 --> 03:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
the Bachelor of it and that made a big
 
03:12:57.349 --> 03:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
difference and finally this is very key
 
03:12:57.359 --> 03:12:58.429 align:start position:0%
difference and finally this is very key
thing

03:12:58.429 --> 03:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:13:01.130 --> 03:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
there is no natural or Civil Right to
 
03:13:03.110 --> 03:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
spread a deadly contagious respiratory
 
03:13:06.290 --> 03:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
virus so that's um
 
03:13:08.030 --> 03:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
you do have a I mean you have the right
 
03:13:09.950 --> 03:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
to decide uh how you want to be treated
 
03:13:11.210 --> 03:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
but you don't have the right to to
 
03:13:14.210 --> 03:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
spread it to someone else so that's um
 
03:13:16.070 --> 03:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's my bill I think it's a I think
 
03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's fairly simple uh it fell a little
 
03:13:20.809 --> 03:13:20.819 align:start position:0%
short last time but uh that was then
 
03:13:23.450 --> 03:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
this is now and at the worst
 
03:13:25.849 --> 03:13:25.859 align:start position:0%
and the worst uh at the worst you can
 
03:13:28.429 --> 03:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
say that it's it's harmless but
 
03:13:31.070 --> 03:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
um so I I would uh
 
03:13:32.690 --> 03:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
and we should err on this side of
 
03:13:34.790 --> 03:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
caution so we so be happy to take any
 
03:13:38.389 --> 03:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:39.410 --> 03:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:13:41.210 --> 03:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative yes
 
03:13:43.429 --> 03:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
representative proud thank you Mr Urban
 
03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative my question
 
03:13:48.769 --> 03:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
um how specifically regarding the um
 
03:13:50.450 --> 03:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
right to use personal protective
 
03:13:51.950 --> 03:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
equipment such as face mask and face
 
03:13:53.150 --> 03:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
Shields while employing the workplace
 
03:13:55.849 --> 03:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
how would you see this interact with um
 
03:13:58.490 --> 03:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
any sort of regulations or workplace
 
03:14:01.250 --> 03:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
requirements for like closed spaces and
 
03:14:03.469 --> 03:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
other disadvantaged workplaces where
 
03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
there are very specific requirements for
 
03:14:09.170 --> 03:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
safety that may interfere with this
 
03:14:09.180 --> 03:14:10.190 align:start position:0%
safety that may interfere with this
right

03:14:10.190 --> 03:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:14:12.650 --> 03:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
um and other working conditions where
 
03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
that sort of issue would come up
 
03:14:17.870 --> 03:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't know specifically if you feel
 
03:14:17.880 --> 03:14:18.710 align:start position:0%
um I don't know specifically if you feel
there's

03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:14:20.570 --> 03:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
if you feel there's an issue the bills
 
03:14:23.389 --> 03:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
in your committee so you're free to uh
 
03:14:25.550 --> 03:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
put an amendment to clarify that if you
 
03:14:27.230 --> 03:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
want I think I mean
 
03:14:29.389 --> 03:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
most of the time I can think of more
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
situations where you know like
 
03:14:33.170 --> 03:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
especially like the medical industry or
 
03:14:34.610 --> 03:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
let's see where you're required to mask
 
03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
up even
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
in the absence of a coveted pandemic and
 
03:14:41.150 --> 03:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
or wear face Shields I think this is a
 
03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know Industries where
 
03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
those common uh commonly used items uh
 
03:14:47.690 --> 03:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
interfere with other safety requirements
 
03:14:50.630 --> 03:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
but if if there are some um if there are
 
03:14:53.510 --> 03:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
some then maybe the bill needs to be to
 
03:14:55.250 --> 03:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
be tweaked because I certainly also
 
03:14:57.650 --> 03:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
think it may need to be tweaked to
 
03:14:59.870 --> 03:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
prevent discrimination at the hiring end
 
03:15:02.150 --> 03:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
before you're working there because I
 
03:15:04.010 --> 03:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
did see an example of that whether it's
 
03:15:06.110 --> 03:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
isolated or not I don't necessarily know
 
03:15:08.030 --> 03:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
but yeah so
 
03:15:09.950 --> 03:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
if you want to mend a bill to adjust
 
03:15:11.690 --> 03:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
that issue you're welcome to do so and
 
03:15:13.550 --> 03:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh depending on whether I like the
 
03:15:16.010 --> 03:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
amendment or not I'll support it or not
 
03:15:19.010 --> 03:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:22.429 --> 03:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative thank
 
03:15:24.410 --> 03:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I've received a lot of
 
03:15:26.210 --> 03:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
messages from people in my district as
 
03:15:27.769 --> 03:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
well as others to amend the bill to
 
03:15:31.190 --> 03:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
protect the unvaccinated as well would
 
03:15:34.309 --> 03:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
you oppose a bill to ban uh if we
 
03:15:36.769 --> 03:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
amended this bill to also include the
 
03:15:38.690 --> 03:15:38.700 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated as protected from
 
03:15:40.550 --> 03:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination would you support it or
 
03:15:43.130 --> 03:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
would you oppose it well it depends on
 
03:15:45.530 --> 03:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
the Texas bill but I probably uh
 
03:15:47.210 --> 03:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
I would probably oppose that I mean
 
03:15:49.070 --> 03:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
certainly we have the right not to get
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinated but that doesn't necessarily
 
03:15:53.210 --> 03:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
mean that everybody else
 
03:15:55.670 --> 03:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
has to pretend that it's
 
03:15:58.550 --> 03:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
just as safe for that person they share
 
03:16:00.590 --> 03:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
our the air that we breathe as it is
 
03:16:02.929 --> 03:16:02.939 align:start position:0%
from somebody who's uh who's not
 
03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and certainly the mass and
 
03:16:07.790 --> 03:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
stuff then well very few people are
 
03:16:09.290 --> 03:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
wearing them you see a few around the
 
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
state house but uh there's
 
03:16:13.550 --> 03:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
um very few people who actually can't
 
03:16:15.050 --> 03:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
wear them at all and certainly there
 
03:16:16.429 --> 03:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
were exceptions to the rules for those
 
03:16:18.950 --> 03:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
so I would I would probably
 
03:16:21.230 --> 03:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
I'd probably be I don't haven't seen the
 
03:16:23.330 --> 03:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
Amendments like I I can't I don't want
 
03:16:24.950 --> 03:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
to speculate too much but I would guess
 
03:16:27.230 --> 03:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
probably I probably I would not be in
 
03:16:28.969 --> 03:16:28.979 align:start position:0%
too enthusiastic about it but I will
 
03:16:31.070 --> 03:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
defer my final judgment until the
 
03:16:32.809 --> 03:16:32.819 align:start position:0%
committee finishes at work and it comes
 
03:16:37.309 --> 03:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:37.319 --> 03:16:40.250 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:16:40.250 --> 03:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative taking the question um
 
03:16:44.690 --> 03:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
how do you Rectify this with workman's
 
03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
compensation if the employee
 
03:16:50.809 --> 03:16:50.819 align:start position:0%
it overheats on a hot day wearing
 
03:16:52.250 --> 03:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
protective equipment
 
03:16:54.170 --> 03:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
and falls and hurts themselves because
 
03:16:55.309 --> 03:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
of the protective equipment with
 
03:16:58.130 --> 03:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
workman's compensation cover them I uh
 
03:16:58.140 --> 03:16:59.269 align:start position:0%
workman's compensation cover them I uh
well

03:16:59.269 --> 03:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:17:01.250 --> 03:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not actually my workman compensation
 
03:17:03.650 --> 03:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
we did have a
 
03:17:06.349 --> 03:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
we did have two summers uh well when
 
03:17:08.570 --> 03:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
people were commonly masking so like the
 
03:17:11.630 --> 03:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
the pandemic hit the U.S and
 
03:17:14.630 --> 03:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
well in Earnest in mid-march of 2020 so
 
03:17:18.290 --> 03:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
the summer is the 21 and 22 were uh
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
where um
 
03:17:22.190 --> 03:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
the counts numbers of 21 and 22 did
 
03:17:25.370 --> 03:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
happen before we began getting back to
 
03:17:27.469 --> 03:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
to the to normal or at least the new
 
03:17:28.610 --> 03:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
normal so
 
03:17:28.620 --> 03:17:29.389 align:start position:0%
normal so
um

03:17:29.389 --> 03:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:31.070 --> 03:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
I don't really know if large numbers of
 
03:17:32.450 --> 03:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
people were overheating and stuff
 
03:17:35.630 --> 03:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
certainly uh this is just uh I mean you
 
03:17:38.269 --> 03:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
can wave the record I mean so we can
 
03:17:40.670 --> 03:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
waive the requirement if uh if somebody
 
03:17:42.950 --> 03:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
is uh is indeed overheating just from
 
03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
wearing the mask or the face shield but
 
03:17:46.070 --> 03:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
I don't really know that there are a
 
03:17:48.950 --> 03:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
large number of of cases uh related to
 
03:17:50.750 --> 03:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
that as I said we do have two summers
 
03:17:53.030 --> 03:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
worth of data to uh
 
03:17:54.710 --> 03:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
see whether or not that was the case
 
03:17:57.170 --> 03:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
thanks follow up
 
03:17:58.610 --> 03:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for the
 
03:18:00.349 --> 03:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative
 
03:18:05.050 --> 03:18:05.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:08.450 --> 03:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
type of employment that could catch
 
03:18:10.250 --> 03:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
themselves on fire
 
03:18:11.990 --> 03:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
whether it be a welder whether it be
 
03:18:13.309 --> 03:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
somebody cooking in the kitchen whether
 
03:18:14.769 --> 03:18:14.779 align:start position:0%
it be somebody outside
 
03:18:18.110 --> 03:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
doing dangerous work
 
03:18:20.389 --> 03:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
decides to wear a mask
 
03:18:23.090 --> 03:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
well there's typically wear masks anyway
 
03:18:26.090 --> 03:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
so uh they wear protective face shields
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
for their thing but if they have a mask
 
03:18:28.849 --> 03:18:28.859 align:start position:0%
underneath and they you know gets out of
 
03:18:30.469 --> 03:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
their mask and catches their thing on
 
03:18:31.610 --> 03:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
fire with working with compensation
 
03:18:33.650 --> 03:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
cover for that well once again
 
03:18:33.660 --> 03:18:34.490 align:start position:0%
cover for that well once again
um

03:18:34.490 --> 03:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
once again we although obviously the
 
03:18:39.230 --> 03:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
hospitality issues you hit hard but
 
03:18:42.530 --> 03:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
kitchens we do have two years of of data
 
03:18:44.690 --> 03:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
on the incidents in kitchens and Wells
 
03:18:46.730 --> 03:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
and other workplaces where they work
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
with flammable materials so um certainly
 
03:18:52.730 --> 03:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
there are fireproof ppes you can and
 
03:18:54.830 --> 03:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
other social filters that people have
 
03:18:57.530 --> 03:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
been using routinely for years so
 
03:18:57.540 --> 03:18:58.370 align:start position:0%
been using routinely for years so
um

03:18:58.370 --> 03:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:00.889 --> 03:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
once again uh once again I guess I'm not
 
03:19:02.990 --> 03:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not the not the expert on it but I'm
 
03:19:05.330 --> 03:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
sure the information could be available
 
03:19:07.130 --> 03:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
somewhere and certainly there are there
 
03:19:09.710 --> 03:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
are fireproof PPE so like they're not
 
03:19:09.720 --> 03:19:10.790 align:start position:0%
are fireproof PPE so like they're not
all

03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:19:13.990 --> 03:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
let's go it's not just a cheap k95 and
 
03:19:16.370 --> 03:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
paper mask which I agree probably are
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
pretty flammable but there's other
 
03:19:20.809 --> 03:19:20.819 align:start position:0%
there's alternative other alternative
 
03:19:22.610 --> 03:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
devices people can wear and certainly
 
03:19:24.710 --> 03:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
those Industries kept going during the
 
03:19:26.210 --> 03:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
pandemic so there's probably some
 
03:19:28.910 --> 03:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
experience with that
 
03:19:30.910 --> 03:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes
 
03:19:34.070 --> 03:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you uh
 
03:19:35.330 --> 03:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
03:19:37.490 --> 03:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand this so what
 
03:19:40.070 --> 03:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
what the what the in terms of the covet
 
03:19:43.130 --> 03:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
vaccine so a healthcare worker a
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
paramedic A Firefighter all those people
 
03:19:47.570 --> 03:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
can make a decision whether they want to
 
03:19:50.809 --> 03:19:50.819 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated or not yeah and so the
 
03:19:53.750 --> 03:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
employer why does the employer have have
 
03:19:55.610 --> 03:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
access to that information one way or
 
03:19:57.950 --> 03:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
the other that's a very that's a very
 
03:19:59.510 --> 03:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
valid question I mean on the other side
 
03:20:01.070 --> 03:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
that certainly our employers who've
 
03:20:02.690 --> 03:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
asked their employees to be vaccinated
 
03:20:03.950 --> 03:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
and I know
 
03:20:05.870 --> 03:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
at the hearings last year for the
 
03:20:07.370 --> 03:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
anti-vaxx Mills there were a number of
 
03:20:10.250 --> 03:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
people who came in and told us that they
 
03:20:12.349 --> 03:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
had quit their jobs rather than get
 
03:20:14.330 --> 03:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
vaccinated after being asked to be
 
03:20:15.830 --> 03:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or
 
03:20:18.710 --> 03:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
or otherwise so that's uh
 
03:20:21.110 --> 03:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
I mean most cases the employer doesn't
 
03:20:23.150 --> 03:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
know for sure but they uh I mean it's
 
03:20:25.309 --> 03:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to get vaccinated and not
 
03:20:26.990 --> 03:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
tell your employer if your employer had
 
03:20:29.809 --> 03:20:29.819 align:start position:0%
such a Prohibition in place and uh
 
03:20:32.690 --> 03:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
I do know I do know anecdotally when I
 
03:20:34.969 --> 03:20:34.979 align:start position:0%
went for the vax
 
03:20:37.070 --> 03:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
you know we had the vaccine clinic
 
03:20:39.889 --> 03:20:39.899 align:start position:0%
um March 20 2021 I know at least one of
 
03:20:41.450 --> 03:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
our colleagues came who's
 
03:20:43.429 --> 03:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
one of the most vocal anti-vaxxers and
 
03:20:45.769 --> 03:20:45.779 align:start position:0%
uh he he came in and got the J J shot
 
03:20:47.330 --> 03:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
just like uh
 
03:20:49.010 --> 03:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
other members of us who are expressing
 
03:20:51.410 --> 03:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
different positions so I mean that's uh
 
03:20:52.730 --> 03:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say anything more about
 
03:20:54.769 --> 03:20:54.779 align:start position:0%
it than that because that's his decision
 
03:20:56.690 --> 03:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
and I understand why he made it and then
 
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
I understand why he's made the decisions
 
03:21:00.530 --> 03:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
he's made since then but you know it is
 
03:21:01.969 --> 03:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
true if your employer bends it it's
 
03:21:05.090 --> 03:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
pretty hard for them to find out so but
 
03:21:07.269 --> 03:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
still this would prohibit them from
 
03:21:09.710 --> 03:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
harassing you if they don't like the
 
03:21:12.410 --> 03:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
vaccine and found out that you got faxed
 
03:21:15.769 --> 03:21:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:17.510 --> 03:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up I don't think so no
 
03:21:20.330 --> 03:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
03:21:22.190 --> 03:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
03:21:22.200 --> 03:21:23.210 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
testimony

03:21:23.210 --> 03:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:21:23.220 --> 03:21:24.530 align:start position:0%
testimony
the

03:21:24.530 --> 03:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:21:28.130 --> 03:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
final card that I have is Melissa blasek
 
03:21:31.550 --> 03:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh representing rebuild New Hampshire uh
 
03:21:33.769 --> 03:21:33.779 align:start position:0%
requesting three minutes and has not
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
signed up either in support or
 
03:21:35.520 --> 03:21:36.889 align:start position:0%
signed up either in support or
opposition

03:21:36.889 --> 03:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
03:21:38.450 --> 03:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
aye thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:21:40.670 --> 03:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Melissa blasik I'm the
 
03:21:43.550 --> 03:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
executive director of rebuild NH and uh
 
03:21:45.710 --> 03:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
we are neither supporting nor opposing
 
03:21:50.570 --> 03:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
this bill as written we do oppose all
 
03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination against anybody who would
 
03:21:57.050 --> 03:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
choose to get a vaccine or not or wear a
 
03:21:58.969 --> 03:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
mask or not
 
03:21:58.979 --> 03:21:59.809 align:start position:0%
mask or not
um

03:21:59.809 --> 03:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:01.969 --> 03:22:01.979 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the bill as written is
 
03:22:07.910 --> 03:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
only one side of that coin and I find it
 
03:22:11.090 --> 03:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
a little difficult to believe that it is
 
03:22:14.090 --> 03:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
a widespread issue considering that for
 
03:22:15.950 --> 03:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
two to three years there have been
 
03:22:19.550 --> 03:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
government mandates for the vaccines and
 
03:22:21.050 --> 03:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
masks and
 
03:22:22.969 --> 03:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
I somewhat find it hard to believe that
 
03:22:25.370 --> 03:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
people could be facing widespread
 
03:22:27.170 --> 03:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
discrimination for simply following
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
government dictates however and I do
 
03:22:32.450 --> 03:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
find it um
 
03:22:35.330 --> 03:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
a little offensive to uh the countless
 
03:22:37.250 --> 03:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
people who did lose their livelihoods
 
03:22:40.490 --> 03:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
for their choice to not get a very
 
03:22:42.769 --> 03:22:42.779 align:start position:0%
non-sterilizing vaccine
 
03:22:44.090 --> 03:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
um that actually is showing negative
 
03:22:46.250 --> 03:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
efficacy at the moment
 
03:22:48.290 --> 03:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
um so but
 
03:22:50.450 --> 03:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
as written I feel that the bill is a
 
03:22:53.210 --> 03:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem but we
 
03:22:56.389 --> 03:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
would support amending the bill to
 
03:22:56.399 --> 03:22:59.050 align:start position:0%
would support amending the bill to
include

03:22:59.050 --> 03:22:59.060 align:start position:0%
include
 
03:23:01.010 --> 03:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination for those who get a
 
03:23:03.650 --> 03:23:03.660 align:start position:0%
vaccine do not get a vaccine wear a mask
 
03:23:06.530 --> 03:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
or do not get a mask and that is
 
03:23:08.809 --> 03:23:08.819 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony
 
03:23:12.349 --> 03:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:14.809 --> 03:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
I see no question so thank you again
 
03:23:17.150 --> 03:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Broody if
 
03:23:20.229 --> 03:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
you could pass the blue sheet for uh
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:23.760 --> 03:23:25.969 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:23:25.969 --> 03:23:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:29.450 --> 03:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
and I do have the online testimony for
 
03:23:33.290 --> 03:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
that online 11 signed in in support 18
 
03:23:37.190 --> 03:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
and up position and seven signed in with
 
03:23:50.389 --> 03:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:50.399 --> 03:24:00.229 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:04.010 --> 03:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
and on the paper sign-in sheet we had
 
03:24:11.030 --> 03:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
so with that we've got about six more
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
minutes before we can open our next
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
hearing so the committee will be in
 
03:24:22.490 --> 03:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
recess until 1 30. thank you
 
03:24:22.500 --> 03:24:56.630 align:start position:0%

I would like to open the public hearing
 
03:30:52.370 --> 03:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 74 relative to an

employee's unused earned time and
 
03:30:57.530 --> 03:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill if you would
 
03:30:58.849 --> 03:30:58.859 align:start position:0%
introduce your bill
 
03:31:01.070 --> 03:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I am
 
03:31:03.110 --> 03:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Cahill from
 
03:31:05.330 --> 03:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
Newmarket I represent the towns of
 
03:31:08.510 --> 03:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
Newmarket and new Fields Rockingham 10.
 
03:31:10.370 --> 03:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:31:10.380 --> 03:31:11.929 align:start position:0%
and uh
we

03:31:11.929 --> 03:31:11.939 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:31:14.809 --> 03:31:14.819 align:start position:0%
ber has seen this bill a few times in
 
03:31:16.849 --> 03:31:16.859 align:start position:0%
various iterations this is very similar
 
03:31:18.590 --> 03:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
to the one that we talked about last
 
03:31:20.750 --> 03:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
year so but for the benefit of the new
 
03:31:22.969 --> 03:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
members I certainly want to talk about
 
03:31:25.849 --> 03:31:25.859 align:start position:0%
it again and and perhaps reinforce the
 
03:31:30.650 --> 03:31:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:32.690 --> 03:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
with this legislation I hope to prevent
 
03:31:35.030 --> 03:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
the loss of ironed but unused time that
 
03:31:37.610 --> 03:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
is and that this be recognized as wages
 
03:31:39.710 --> 03:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
do when employment ends under certain
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
conditions these would include the sale
 
03:31:44.450 --> 03:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
of the company where the time would be
 
03:31:46.370 --> 03:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
transferred to the new owner or wages
 
03:31:48.950 --> 03:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
paid by the prior owner now this is
 
03:31:50.570 --> 03:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
something that is very commonplace but
 
03:31:53.090 --> 03:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
apparently not required in the state of
 
03:31:55.550 --> 03:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when the company ceases
 
03:31:58.070 --> 03:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
operations again this is something where
 
03:32:00.769 --> 03:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
the employee had no control perhaps very
 
03:32:03.110 --> 03:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
little notice and
 
03:32:05.269 --> 03:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
you would pay the wages that they had
 
03:32:08.210 --> 03:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
for the previous week or pre-pray period
 
03:32:10.610 --> 03:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
but not the vacation wages that that was
 
03:32:13.370 --> 03:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
not your policy again people have earned
 
03:32:15.710 --> 03:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
these wages earned the vacation or a
 
03:32:19.010 --> 03:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
layoff often happens without notice uh
 
03:32:21.170 --> 03:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
one of the examples I've included in the
 
03:32:25.010 --> 03:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
packet is a person who was laid off uh
 
03:32:28.309 --> 03:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
on a Friday and the uh
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
file the claim with the apartment with
 
03:32:32.090 --> 03:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
the labor department
 
03:32:34.550 --> 03:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
but the the
 
03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
the policy of the employer was that you
 
03:32:38.870 --> 03:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
had to request your vacation time three
 
03:32:41.870 --> 03:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
weeks in advance and with being laid off
 
03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
with no notice you'd have no opportunity
 
03:32:46.849 --> 03:32:46.859 align:start position:0%
to to request three weeks in advance so
 
03:32:49.190 --> 03:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
this in fact is another situation where
 
03:32:51.769 --> 03:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
the person lost I think it was on twenty
 
03:32:53.570 --> 03:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
three hundred dollars which is
 
03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
significant uh really through no fault
 
03:32:59.990 --> 03:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
to their own and these wages would be
 
03:33:03.290 --> 03:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
paid if this bill was were to pass going
 
03:33:05.809 --> 03:33:05.819 align:start position:0%
forward so
 
03:33:08.570 --> 03:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
uh the fourth one is when the employee
 
03:33:10.190 --> 03:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
leaves in good standing given proper
 
03:33:12.710 --> 03:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
notice Etc this is something that uh was
 
03:33:16.610 --> 03:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
given to me by our The Honorable uh
 
03:33:16.620 --> 03:33:19.010 align:start position:0%
given to me by our The Honorable uh
representative

03:33:19.010 --> 03:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:33:22.010 --> 03:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
personal annuities who served on this
 
03:33:24.229 --> 03:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
committee and had experience in human
 
03:33:26.510 --> 03:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
resources and this is something where I
 
03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
know people had said well what if I
 
03:33:30.650 --> 03:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
catch the person stealing or they punch
 
03:33:32.929 --> 03:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
the boss in the nose and this is really
 
03:33:35.090 --> 03:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
what what if that doesn't happen what if
 
03:33:36.290 --> 03:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
you had somebody who worked in your
 
03:33:38.690 --> 03:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
company contributed and now this is just
 
03:33:40.729 --> 03:33:40.739 align:start position:0%
the time for them to move on various
 
03:33:43.929 --> 03:33:43.939 align:start position:0%
reasons and they uh perhaps they'll even
 
03:33:47.150 --> 03:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
spend a little time helping train the
 
03:33:47.160 --> 03:33:48.110 align:start position:0%
spend a little time helping train the
replacement

03:33:48.110 --> 03:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
03:33:50.090 --> 03:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
this could be this could be worth
 
03:33:53.150 --> 03:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
something to you and you know earlier we
 
03:33:55.190 --> 03:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that businesses like
 
03:33:56.510 --> 03:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
their employees and I'd like to think
 
03:33:59.450 --> 03:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
that's true and so why would you deny
 
03:34:00.769 --> 03:34:00.779 align:start position:0%
them something that they've earned
 
03:34:03.110 --> 03:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
simply because you can
 
03:34:05.389 --> 03:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
so uh current law is Guided by the
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
employer's practice or policy which may
 
03:34:10.130 --> 03:34:10.140 align:start position:0%
include this blanket statement vacation
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
slash PTO is not paid upon termination I
 
03:34:14.809 --> 03:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
bring this legislation because
 
03:34:17.510 --> 03:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances matter and when they are
 
03:34:19.250 --> 03:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
beyond the employee's control they
 
03:34:21.410 --> 03:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
should not lose what they have earned I
 
03:34:22.729 --> 03:34:22.739 align:start position:0%
have cited the case where several
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
employees lost their earned time when
 
03:34:26.630 --> 03:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
the business was sold the employer's
 
03:34:28.370 --> 03:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
policy stated it is not paid on
 
03:34:30.410 --> 03:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
termination and they made no provision
 
03:34:32.269 --> 03:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
for their hours to be transferred to the
 
03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
new company where they continue to work
 
03:34:37.070 --> 03:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
in another case an employee lost three
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
weeks when laid off without notice the
 
03:34:40.610 --> 03:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
employer's policy required two weeks of
 
03:34:42.530 --> 03:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
dance notice when requesting time off
 
03:34:43.790 --> 03:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
which was impossible under the
 
03:34:47.150 --> 03:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
circumstance I want to point out the uh
 
03:34:48.849 --> 03:34:48.859 align:start position:0%
Pines of New Market
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
documents when the
 
03:34:56.690 --> 03:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:58.849 --> 03:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
a nice given a separate sheet listing
 
03:35:01.969 --> 03:35:01.979 align:start position:0%
the the the dollars that were claimed
 
03:35:04.250 --> 03:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
attempted to claim that were accrued
 
03:35:07.429 --> 03:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
vacation uh by five employees who did
 
03:35:10.729 --> 03:35:10.739 align:start position:0%
file and lost because the employer's
 
03:35:13.309 --> 03:35:13.319 align:start position:0%
policy said we don't pay out doesn't
 
03:35:15.530 --> 03:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
matter that you've earned it and that
 
03:35:18.490 --> 03:35:18.500 align:start position:0%
employer simply kept the
 
03:35:18.500 --> 03:35:20.110 align:start position:0%
employer simply kept the
2261.44

03:35:20.110 --> 03:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
2261.44
 
03:35:22.490 --> 03:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
that should have been paid to those five
 
03:35:22.500 --> 03:35:25.250 align:start position:0%
that should have been paid to those five
workers

03:35:25.250 --> 03:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
workers
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I digress
 
03:35:28.080 --> 03:35:29.929 align:start position:0%
sorry I digress
um

03:35:29.929 --> 03:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:33.290 --> 03:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
right so uh of the applicable conditions
 
03:35:35.389 --> 03:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
listed above only the only the last is
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
controversial in that the employee has a
 
03:35:39.469 --> 03:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
role in the decision consider the
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
vacation that vacation requests are
 
03:35:42.650 --> 03:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
approved by management and that the
 
03:35:44.330 --> 03:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
needs of the business the ability to
 
03:35:46.969 --> 03:35:46.979 align:start position:0%
cover the task Etc may not align with
 
03:35:48.830 --> 03:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
the employee's plans
 
03:35:51.110 --> 03:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
it may be in the best interest of the
 
03:35:52.910 --> 03:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
company for the departing employee to be
 
03:35:55.190 --> 03:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
at work the entire month the entire last
 
03:35:57.650 --> 03:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
month rather than taking two weeks off
 
03:36:00.710 --> 03:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
rather than lose them then giving notice
 
03:36:02.870 --> 03:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
this would be to be particularly helpful
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
if the new hire would benefit from the
 
03:36:06.290 --> 03:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
experience of the outgoing employee
 
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
during the transition
 
03:36:10.070 --> 03:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
so is this a problem for the legislature
 
03:36:13.370 --> 03:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
to solve some may say the policy was in
 
03:36:14.929 --> 03:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
the employee handbook it's a contract
 
03:36:16.969 --> 03:36:16.979 align:start position:0%
well yes this allows the employee to
 
03:36:19.309 --> 03:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
plan the vacations and comply with any
 
03:36:21.410 --> 03:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
user to lose it and carryovers in the
 
03:36:23.570 --> 03:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
handbook these Provisions are unaffected
 
03:36:25.309 --> 03:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
by the legislation it is primarily
 
03:36:27.710 --> 03:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
addressing the events the employee could
 
03:36:29.809 --> 03:36:29.819 align:start position:0%
not plan for like when Lucy moves the
 
03:36:29.819 --> 03:36:31.190 align:start position:0%
not plan for like when Lucy moves the
football

03:36:31.190 --> 03:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
football
 
03:36:33.950 --> 03:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
so I have data a link here to the data
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
from the labor Department's ways
 
03:36:38.690 --> 03:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
decisions and again not every claim not
 
03:36:41.809 --> 03:36:41.819 align:start position:0%
every call or claim is logged only those
 
03:36:43.610 --> 03:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
that go to a hearing were both parties
 
03:36:43.620 --> 03:36:45.349 align:start position:0%
that go to a hearing were both parties
attend

03:36:45.349 --> 03:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
attend
 
03:36:47.570 --> 03:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
so the numbers are probably a bit larger
 
03:36:50.030 --> 03:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
than what I report here but I did give
 
03:36:51.410 --> 03:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
you some numbers and that this is
 
03:36:56.030 --> 03:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:58.910 --> 03:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
and when people when people don't have
 
03:37:01.070 --> 03:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
their vacation pay at the end if they go
 
03:37:04.670 --> 03:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
to collect unemployment uh
 
03:37:06.769 --> 03:37:06.779 align:start position:0%
they started immediately whereas if they
 
03:37:09.710 --> 03:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
paid their vacation that those times is
 
03:37:12.530 --> 03:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
used up before any any funds come from
 
03:37:14.690 --> 03:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
the trust fund so if you have a week's
 
03:37:17.870 --> 03:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
vacation paid to you your your claim
 
03:37:20.269 --> 03:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
begins after that is used up so we
 
03:37:23.090 --> 03:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
protect the trust fund we honor the work
 
03:37:25.729 --> 03:37:25.739 align:start position:0%
of our employees and our commitment and
 
03:37:29.030 --> 03:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a value that we should be
 
03:37:30.349 --> 03:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
03:37:30.359 --> 03:37:33.110 align:start position:0%
doing this
so

03:37:33.110 --> 03:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:35.809 --> 03:37:35.819 align:start position:0%
with that I will end and take any
 
03:37:38.330 --> 03:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
03:37:38.340 --> 03:37:42.349 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
questions

03:37:42.349 --> 03:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:45.110 --> 03:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
I don't see any questions so thank you
 
03:37:46.849 --> 03:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
for your testimony may I add one more
 
03:37:49.729 --> 03:37:49.739 align:start position:0%
thing yes you may thank you Mr chair I
 
03:37:51.889 --> 03:37:51.899 align:start position:0%
did notice Mr arlinghaus and I think
 
03:37:53.330 --> 03:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
he's going to speak to the fiscal note
 
03:37:55.610 --> 03:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
which does seem like a large figure but
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
I believe that refers to a mass Exodus
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
of state employees which we will not
 
03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
happen I know we're not we're not famous
 
03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
for paying high wages but I don't think
 
03:38:06.469 --> 03:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to quit at once
 
03:38:08.170 --> 03:38:08.180 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:38:11.830 --> 03:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
with that introduction I I would ask
 
03:38:14.210 --> 03:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus
 
03:38:16.190 --> 03:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
of the Department of administrative
 
03:38:18.650 --> 03:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
services to speak he has checked off
 
03:38:20.990 --> 03:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
that he's in support of the bill and I'm
 
03:38:22.130 --> 03:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
a little concerned it looks like you
 
03:38:23.330 --> 03:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
said you're going to speak for an hour
 
03:38:26.330 --> 03:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
and an hour and a half uh a minute and
 
03:38:29.090 --> 03:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
30 seconds okay good
 
03:38:30.830 --> 03:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm Charlie arlinghaus I'm the
 
03:38:32.030 --> 03:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative Services
 
03:38:35.210 --> 03:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
I to be clear I'm neither in supporter
 
03:38:37.190 --> 03:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
or in opposition to the Bill I'm here to
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
explain our fiscal note
 
03:38:38.640 --> 03:38:39.530 align:start position:0%
explain our fiscal note
um

03:38:39.530 --> 03:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:42.889 --> 03:38:42.899 align:start position:0%
so the fiscal note was written uh by
 
03:38:44.210 --> 03:38:44.220 align:start position:0%
somebody saying what's the maximum
 
03:38:46.610 --> 03:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
possible impact of this and and the the
 
03:38:49.250 --> 03:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
number is extraordinarily large based on
 
03:38:50.990 --> 03:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
who doesn't accrue leave in our current
 
03:38:53.809 --> 03:38:53.819 align:start position:0%
system and I can explain that if state
 
03:38:55.550 --> 03:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
government shut down entirely and
 
03:38:57.530 --> 03:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
everybody were laid off these are the
 
03:38:59.510 --> 03:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
people who don't accrue leave I think
 
03:39:02.030 --> 03:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
that eventuality is unlikely State
 
03:39:03.530 --> 03:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
government's very unlikely to shut down
 
03:39:05.750 --> 03:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
and 11 000 people get laid off I'm not
 
03:39:08.030 --> 03:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
aware of any plans in that direction and
 
03:39:09.950 --> 03:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
they would concern me
 
03:39:12.110 --> 03:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
um but it it outlines who the people are
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
and they're about they're about 830
 
03:39:15.950 --> 03:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
people who don't accrue leave they fall
 
03:39:17.570 --> 03:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
into two buckets
 
03:39:18.769 --> 03:39:18.779 align:start position:0%
um they don't accrue leaving the system
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
one of them I'm going to actually
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
dismiss from the fiscal note immediately
 
03:39:24.290 --> 03:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
which is judicial branch employees
 
03:39:25.849 --> 03:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
because they track their leads
 
03:39:28.070 --> 03:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
separately judicial branch employees do
 
03:39:30.769 --> 03:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
get paid out leave upon Exodus upon
 
03:39:32.690 --> 03:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
retirement or dismissal resignation or
 
03:39:36.410 --> 03:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
dismissal and so 570 or so of those
 
03:39:36.420 --> 03:39:37.370 align:start position:0%
dismissal and so 570 or so of those
people

03:39:37.370 --> 03:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:39:39.769 --> 03:39:39.779 align:start position:0%
um you should ignore from your fiscal
 
03:39:42.050 --> 03:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
which would lower it the fiscal note
 
03:39:46.870 --> 03:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
then refers to about 259 260
 
03:39:50.330 --> 03:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
unclassified employees and and because
 
03:39:51.769 --> 03:39:51.779 align:start position:0%
of the way the bill is written we don't
 
03:39:53.389 --> 03:39:53.399 align:start position:0%
know if it applies to them or doesn't
 
03:39:56.690 --> 03:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
apply to them from this standpoint
 
03:39:58.790 --> 03:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
classified employees in the state system
 
03:40:01.849 --> 03:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
accrue leave the leave is is banked and
 
03:40:03.469 --> 03:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
managed and tracked in New Hampshire
 
03:40:06.530 --> 03:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
first the state computer system and upon
 
03:40:08.450 --> 03:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
their uh leaving in the system they do
 
03:40:10.490 --> 03:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
get paid out for annual time that's on
 
03:40:12.889 --> 03:40:12.899 align:start position:0%
the books and whether they're laid off
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
whether they resign or whatever the
 
03:40:17.210 --> 03:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
circumstances are unclassified employees
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
do not they don't accrue leave their
 
03:40:22.309 --> 03:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
leave is not managed in that way upon
 
03:40:25.070 --> 03:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
their leaving the system there is a
 
03:40:27.650 --> 03:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
there is a payout in lieu of that of
 
03:40:30.050 --> 03:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
three days per year worked
 
03:40:32.809 --> 03:40:32.819 align:start position:0%
and so regardless of regardless of what
 
03:40:34.429 --> 03:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
happened so that the leave is not
 
03:40:38.269 --> 03:40:38.279 align:start position:0%
tracked in that way if that payout is
 
03:40:41.210 --> 03:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
sufficient for the meaning of the bill
 
03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
um then there's no fiscal no whatsoever
 
03:40:44.990 --> 03:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
if it's not sufficient for the meaning
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill the cost because I want to
 
03:40:50.809 --> 03:40:50.819 align:start position:0%
exclude the judicial employees is about
 
03:40:52.610 --> 03:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
um a third of the number that's in your
 
03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and in addition to that it's
 
03:40:56.929 --> 03:40:56.939 align:start position:0%
worth noting that that is a thought
 
03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
exercise about what is the maximum
 
03:41:01.010 --> 03:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
possible liability
 
03:41:03.410 --> 03:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
and the unlikely event the state
 
03:41:05.870 --> 03:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
government were to end which is not
 
03:41:07.429 --> 03:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
probably something you want to use for
 
03:41:09.590 --> 03:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
your purposes I think for your planning
 
03:41:12.530 --> 03:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
purposes the fiscal impact on this is on
 
03:41:16.010 --> 03:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:18.830 --> 03:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony I do have a
 
03:41:18.840 --> 03:41:20.150 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony I do have a
question

03:41:20.150 --> 03:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:41:23.870 --> 03:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
um so given the situation where you have
 
03:41:26.570 --> 03:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
a payout but it's not
 
03:41:29.330 --> 03:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
let's say it's considered to not be in
 
03:41:33.710 --> 03:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
compliant with this bill would that then
 
03:41:36.729 --> 03:41:36.739 align:start position:0%
um in your mind make it a priority
 
03:41:39.889 --> 03:41:39.899 align:start position:0%
given this effect to say well we need to
 
03:41:43.190 --> 03:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
change the way remove the the payout
 
03:41:45.170 --> 03:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
that we have and replace it with
 
03:41:47.150 --> 03:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
something that matches the language it's
 
03:41:50.269 --> 03:41:50.279 align:start position:0%
possible for the 259 people we would
 
03:41:52.969 --> 03:41:52.979 align:start position:0%
have to do that for the unclassified
 
03:41:56.590 --> 03:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
employees I don't
 
03:42:00.110 --> 03:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
if I'm honest I think that I think what
 
03:42:02.510 --> 03:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
would probably happen and and lawyers
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
would decide that's not me is we would
 
03:42:06.710 --> 03:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
argue that that system is compliant with
 
03:42:09.110 --> 03:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
the bill and I think I think my quick
 
03:42:10.610 --> 03:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
read of the bill is that that's an
 
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
argument that could go either way and so
 
03:42:14.450 --> 03:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
that that's what I would argue first if
 
03:42:16.010 --> 03:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
it were found to be that case we would
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
merely have to have to tweak the way we
 
03:42:22.729 --> 03:42:22.739 align:start position:0%
um account for unclassified employees I
 
03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
don't think it would have any dramatic
 
03:42:26.330 --> 03:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
effect on state government
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you my pleasure any other question
 
03:42:31.910 --> 03:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
03:42:33.410 --> 03:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
03:42:33.420 --> 03:42:35.510 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
commissionerlinghaus

03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
commissionerlinghaus
 
03:42:40.370 --> 03:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal note with this did you include
 
03:42:44.210 --> 03:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
any County or local
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't I don't we don't really have
 
03:42:48.110 --> 03:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
any way to um to account for that we
 
03:42:49.429 --> 03:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
don't we don't have the data or the
 
03:42:51.349 --> 03:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
records to know the impact on County and
 
03:42:54.110 --> 03:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
local thank you thank you
 
03:42:57.050 --> 03:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:42:58.849 --> 03:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for a testimony
 
03:43:01.610 --> 03:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
thanks have a great day
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
um next up I'd like to ask Dave Juve he
 
03:43:08.690 --> 03:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
is representing the Bia he is in
 
03:43:10.130 --> 03:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill and there's a
 
03:43:16.849 --> 03:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:18.530 --> 03:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:43:19.969 --> 03:43:19.979 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
03:43:21.950 --> 03:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
David Juve I'm a senior vice president
 
03:43:24.290 --> 03:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
for public policy with the business and
 
03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
industry Association
 
03:43:29.570 --> 03:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to the bill but it's a
 
03:43:32.269 --> 03:43:32.279 align:start position:0%
issue that I have had frequent
 
03:43:34.849 --> 03:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative Cahill
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
about and I promised him today I would
 
03:43:39.950 --> 03:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
say something nice about it and the nice
 
03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
thing I will say is there is a germ of a
 
03:43:47.090 --> 03:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
fair idea in here that I want the
 
03:43:51.170 --> 03:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
committee to recognize and that is there
 
03:43:53.269 --> 03:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
may be situations
 
03:43:56.269 --> 03:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
in employment where an individual is
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
laid off with no notification whatsoever
 
03:44:02.090 --> 03:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
and if they are working for an employer
 
03:44:05.330 --> 03:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
who doesn't pay for earned but unused
 
03:44:05.340 --> 03:44:06.710 align:start position:0%
who doesn't pay for earned but unused
time

03:44:06.710 --> 03:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:44:10.250 --> 03:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
they lose that benefit and so I think
 
03:44:12.410 --> 03:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
the germ of the fair idea would be if
 
03:44:14.510 --> 03:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
you were to limit this
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
to employees
 
03:44:20.330 --> 03:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
who had no control over there leaving
 
03:44:23.389 --> 03:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
the company through a layoff
 
03:44:26.330 --> 03:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
or even if the company were sold and
 
03:44:28.130 --> 03:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
there were not arrangements for that
 
03:44:31.250 --> 03:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
vacation to carry over to be paid off
 
03:44:33.469 --> 03:44:33.479 align:start position:0%
that's something that I think you could
 
03:44:37.370 --> 03:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
legitimately say that's not fair and I
 
03:44:39.650 --> 03:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
think we would acknowledge that's not
 
03:44:39.660 --> 03:44:40.849 align:start position:0%
think we would acknowledge that's not
fair

03:44:40.849 --> 03:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
fair
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
but for us this bill is too broad and it
 
03:44:46.250 --> 03:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
creates problems the first is a
 
03:44:48.530 --> 03:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
philosophical one which you may or may
 
03:44:51.490 --> 03:44:51.500 align:start position:0%
not share with the Bia the philosophy is
 
03:44:54.170 --> 03:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
employers are in the best position to
 
03:44:56.330 --> 03:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
determine what benefits they want to
 
03:44:58.729 --> 03:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
offer to retain employees and attract
 
03:45:00.410 --> 03:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
new employees
 
03:45:02.570 --> 03:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
but there are other issues with the bill
 
03:45:05.630 --> 03:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
one of which is
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
it talks about the accrued time being
 
03:45:11.870 --> 03:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
paid when the employee leaves in good
 
03:45:14.570 --> 03:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
standing or the termination as a result
 
03:45:16.070 --> 03:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
of a layoff
 
03:45:18.170 --> 03:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of companies out
 
03:45:20.210 --> 03:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
there I work for one of them that have a
 
03:45:23.389 --> 03:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
use it or lose it benefit so I get a
 
03:45:26.570 --> 03:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
certain amount of days per year uh paid
 
03:45:29.690 --> 03:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
time off vacation time if I don't use
 
03:45:32.389 --> 03:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
that by the end of the year it's gone
 
03:45:35.750 --> 03:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
and we start afresh January 1st this
 
03:45:38.210 --> 03:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to take that into account
 
03:45:40.370 --> 03:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that was by Design
 
03:45:40.380 --> 03:45:42.050 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that was by Design
meaning

03:45:42.050 --> 03:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
03:45:44.990 --> 03:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's too bad for those employees but
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't use it so they lose it or if
 
03:45:50.570 --> 03:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
it was somehow
 
03:45:52.070 --> 03:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
thought that they should receive that
 
03:45:54.229 --> 03:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't written in the bill
 
03:45:57.710 --> 03:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
the second is
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
there are companies again I'll use my
 
03:46:02.809 --> 03:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
own employer as an example that we have
 
03:46:06.590 --> 03:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
vacation time paid time as a benefit but
 
03:46:08.330 --> 03:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
we also have something else that's
 
03:46:11.090 --> 03:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
called personal time which is also a
 
03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
paid benefit it's not meant to be used
 
03:46:16.849 --> 03:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
for vacations it could be used for sick
 
03:46:19.190 --> 03:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
but it's not called sick time
 
03:46:21.769 --> 03:46:21.779 align:start position:0%
or sick days it could be used if you
 
03:46:24.590 --> 03:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
have a sick child or a sick pet or in my
 
03:46:27.950 --> 03:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
case I used it recently I was flying
 
03:46:30.530 --> 03:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
home from Florida on Monday and my
 
03:46:33.050 --> 03:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
flight was canceled and I couldn't get a
 
03:46:34.849 --> 03:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
flight out until the next day on Tuesday
 
03:46:37.250 --> 03:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
so the day I was planning on being at
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
work I was unable to
 
03:46:41.030 --> 03:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's something that I would take a
 
03:46:43.610 --> 03:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
personal day for not a vacation day so
 
03:46:48.769 --> 03:46:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.809 --> 03:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
and then there are companies and they're
 
03:46:53.630 --> 03:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
becoming more and more common in the
 
03:46:56.510 --> 03:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
technology economy that we're in
 
03:46:59.150 --> 03:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
that don't have vacation days at all
 
03:47:02.269 --> 03:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
they just were time off paid time off is
 
03:47:04.490 --> 03:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
arranged between the individual and the
 
03:47:06.710 --> 03:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
employer and it's not something that's
 
03:47:08.990 --> 03:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
tracked so it's unclear how those
 
03:47:11.330 --> 03:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
companies would make arrangements for
 
03:47:12.530 --> 03:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
this so
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
all in all I think this bill has some
 
03:47:18.769 --> 03:47:18.779 align:start position:0%
problems but if the committee would like
 
03:47:23.090 --> 03:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
to refocus that on just employees who
 
03:47:25.969 --> 03:47:25.979 align:start position:0%
are laid off terminated with no
 
03:47:28.670 --> 03:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge and no ability to do anything
 
03:47:31.250 --> 03:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
about that that's something I think we
 
03:47:34.429 --> 03:47:34.439 align:start position:0%
could all consider thank you Mr chair
 
03:47:36.290 --> 03:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:47:39.889 --> 03:47:39.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:47:41.690 --> 03:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:47:44.150 --> 03:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
um you focus on
 
03:47:46.790 --> 03:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh with your fair idea the the employees
 
03:47:48.410 --> 03:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
that are unable to use the vacation
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have a notice of the
 
03:47:52.969 --> 03:47:52.979 align:start position:0%
of the termination of employment
 
03:47:54.290 --> 03:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
um would you go as far as to extend that
 
03:47:55.550 --> 03:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
to employees who are unable to use a
 
03:47:57.050 --> 03:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
vacation because of the needs of the
 
03:47:58.370 --> 03:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
business and they kept requesting
 
03:48:00.530 --> 03:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
vacation time but they said but the
 
03:48:02.750 --> 03:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
manager kept denying the request saying
 
03:48:04.670 --> 03:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
that's not too good time this is too
 
03:48:06.889 --> 03:48:06.899 align:start position:0%
busy and basically it snowballed
 
03:48:09.410 --> 03:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
bringing them out snowballed in to make
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
you make it completely unable to be used
 
03:48:15.170 --> 03:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
I um thank you for the question I think
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
it is certainly something worth having
 
03:48:19.610 --> 03:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
some discussion about I'm not sure how
 
03:48:19.620 --> 03:48:20.750 align:start position:0%
some discussion about I'm not sure how
one

03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
would track that or if it would be up to
 
03:48:26.990 --> 03:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
the employee to show repeated requests
 
03:48:30.590 --> 03:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
that were denied I I think your example
 
03:48:32.809 --> 03:48:32.819 align:start position:0%
is a good one where it was not in the
 
03:48:34.670 --> 03:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
employee's ability to take the vacation
 
03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
I just don't know if there would be
 
03:48:39.889 --> 03:48:39.899 align:start position:0%
difficulty tracking that or on the
 
03:48:41.469 --> 03:48:41.479 align:start position:0%
employer's part
 
03:48:45.110 --> 03:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
keeping track of of those requests I
 
03:48:48.050 --> 03:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
think it's worthy of discussion
 
03:48:51.050 --> 03:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
and follow follow-up so I think you
 
03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
mostly already answered this but um
 
03:48:55.550 --> 03:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
you you would foresee problems in
 
03:48:57.349 --> 03:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
administering that sort of extension of
 
03:48:59.030 --> 03:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
and determining who would qualify and
 
03:49:03.229 --> 03:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
who wouldn't and the point where it
 
03:49:04.490 --> 03:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
almost would be become unworkable
 
03:49:07.550 --> 03:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
possible possibly I I could I mean you
 
03:49:09.170 --> 03:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
you foresee problems in administering
 
03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
that delineation between if the employee
 
03:49:13.250 --> 03:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
was unable to use the time because of
 
03:49:15.050 --> 03:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
the needs of the business or just
 
03:49:16.910 --> 03:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
because they didn't use it
 
03:49:18.590 --> 03:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
and determining from a departmental
 
03:49:20.330 --> 03:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
labor standpoint which case is qualified
 
03:49:23.570 --> 03:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
which didn't them not using it as fairly
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
black and white the being able to
 
03:49:28.429 --> 03:49:28.439 align:start position:0%
distinguish a request that was turned
 
03:49:31.070 --> 03:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
down the employer could say well that
 
03:49:34.250 --> 03:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
particular week was not good
 
03:49:35.870 --> 03:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
but the next week would have been
 
03:49:38.030 --> 03:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
available but he didn't ask for that so
 
03:49:39.889 --> 03:49:39.899 align:start position:0%
it's it's that type of situation that
 
03:49:41.929 --> 03:49:41.939 align:start position:0%
that creates a gray area
 
03:49:43.790 --> 03:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:43.800 --> 03:49:45.469 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

03:49:45.469 --> 03:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:49:47.330 --> 03:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Juve
 
03:49:49.250 --> 03:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
good to see you again thank you
 
03:49:49.260 --> 03:49:50.450 align:start position:0%
good to see you again thank you
um

03:49:50.450 --> 03:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:54.410 --> 03:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of the layoff
 
03:49:56.090 --> 03:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
we have seasonal obviously New Hampshire
 
03:49:58.130 --> 03:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
has seasonal employees
 
03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
do you see a problem with that if the
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
employee goes back to work a month later
 
03:50:04.130 --> 03:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
after they're being laid off if you know
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
construction right behaving snow plowing
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
removal I mean any any industry that
 
03:50:11.929 --> 03:50:11.939 align:start position:0%
only operates nine months out of the
 
03:50:13.490 --> 03:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
year would lay off yeah for a temporary
 
03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
layoff and then have them come back
 
03:50:17.330 --> 03:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
would you see that being an issue
 
03:50:19.969 --> 03:50:19.979 align:start position:0%
I think it's an excellent question and I
 
03:50:22.010 --> 03:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
guess that is something I would my
 
03:50:23.330 --> 03:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
answer would be the same that is
 
03:50:25.190 --> 03:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
something that would be worthy of
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
discussion I don't know if if one
 
03:50:32.090 --> 03:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
outcome would be they would be paid for
 
03:50:34.670 --> 03:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
any accrued but unused time but then
 
03:50:36.650 --> 03:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
when they start up again two months
 
03:50:39.530 --> 03:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
later they start back at zero I I don't
 
03:50:40.610 --> 03:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
know I think it's something that would
 
03:50:42.590 --> 03:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
have to be discussed thank you thank you
 
03:50:45.469 --> 03:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:49.190 --> 03:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:51.830 --> 03:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
I don't see any so thank you very much
 
03:50:53.510 --> 03:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
for your test thank you
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
and let me see what's on the card
 
03:50:57.120 --> 03:50:59.410 align:start position:0%
and let me see what's on the card
um

03:50:59.410 --> 03:50:59.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
yes but I I think I'll go with this
 
03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
first uh representative Perez
 
03:51:07.190 --> 03:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
is going to speak four to five minutes
 
03:51:12.590 --> 03:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:14.269 --> 03:51:14.279 align:start position:0%
thank you again members of the committee
 
03:51:15.830 --> 03:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak my name is
 
03:51:17.809 --> 03:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
Maria Perez I'm a state representative
 
03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
from District 43 in Milford I'm here to
 
03:51:22.309 --> 03:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
speak and support of this bill because
 
03:51:24.229 --> 03:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
it is critical
 
03:51:26.990 --> 03:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
the people have the right to roll over
 
03:51:29.870 --> 03:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
whatever specific time a personal time
 
03:51:31.330 --> 03:51:31.340 align:start position:0%
they earn
 
03:51:34.670 --> 03:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases especially in some
 
03:51:37.969 --> 03:51:37.979 align:start position:0%
Industries people don't have a coverage
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to use that time before the
 
03:51:44.330 --> 03:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
end of the year
 
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
and if that person works so hard to earn
 
03:51:49.370 --> 03:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
that time I believe that should that
 
03:51:53.030 --> 03:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
they should have the right to roll over
 
03:51:55.550 --> 03:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
that time for example
 
03:51:55.560 --> 03:51:56.330 align:start position:0%
that time for example
um

03:51:56.330 --> 03:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:58.670 --> 03:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to be a little personal
 
03:52:02.210 --> 03:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
in this one my mother-in-law she was
 
03:52:07.849 --> 03:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:09.889 --> 03:52:09.899 align:start position:0%
my husband
 
03:52:12.650 --> 03:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
before preview of that hitting you to
 
03:52:16.130 --> 03:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
utilize the time that he he had
 
03:52:18.830 --> 03:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
he's an electrician so he earns a lot of
 
03:52:20.870 --> 03:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
personal time
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
but by the time at the end of the year
 
03:52:22.800 --> 03:52:24.710 align:start position:0%
but by the time at the end of the year
came

03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
came
 
03:52:26.990 --> 03:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
he still have time off that he can
 
03:52:29.150 --> 03:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
utilize the following year to take his
 
03:52:30.530 --> 03:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
mother for
 
03:52:33.170 --> 03:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
chemo and radiation
 
03:52:35.269 --> 03:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
but he wasn't allowed to roll over that
 
03:52:35.279 --> 03:52:37.130 align:start position:0%
but he wasn't allowed to roll over that
time

03:52:37.130 --> 03:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:52:39.889 --> 03:52:39.899 align:start position:0%
it was hard for us as a family to be
 
03:52:41.750 --> 03:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
able to take my mother love
 
03:52:44.450 --> 03:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
to chemo and radiation
 
03:52:47.690 --> 03:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
without wasting time and not having any
 
03:52:50.809 --> 03:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
more personal time but if we he were
 
03:52:50.819 --> 03:52:51.889 align:start position:0%
more personal time but if we he were
allowed

03:52:51.889 --> 03:52:51.899 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
03:52:54.590 --> 03:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
his employee would allow him to roll
 
03:52:55.969 --> 03:52:55.979 align:start position:0%
over that time
 
03:52:59.090 --> 03:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
he was be able to you know be with his
 
03:53:03.229 --> 03:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
mom and not me taking my personal time
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
or other relatives has to take a day off
 
03:53:09.229 --> 03:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
from work without getting paid because
 
03:53:11.870 --> 03:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
we didn't have someone to be with her
 
03:53:13.910 --> 03:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm supporting this bill and
 
03:53:15.530 --> 03:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
I that's why I think it's critical for
 
03:53:18.650 --> 03:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
us to support employees
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
03:53:20.399 --> 03:53:22.610 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
questions

03:53:22.610 --> 03:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:53:25.670 --> 03:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
I see none so thank you again
 
03:53:28.330 --> 03:53:28.340 align:start position:0%
uh next I would call Bruce Berkey
 
03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
representing nfib New Hampshire
 
03:53:40.250 --> 03:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:42.349 --> 03:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:53:44.090 --> 03:53:44.100 align:start position:0%
committee again Bruce sperkey with the
 
03:53:45.530 --> 03:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
national Federation of Independent
 
03:53:46.809 --> 03:53:46.819 align:start position:0%
Business here in New Hampshire
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
representing over 1400 small businesses
 
03:53:53.150 --> 03:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
and I think my testimony can be somewhat
 
03:53:55.670 --> 03:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
expedited given Mr juve's presentation
 
03:53:56.769 --> 03:53:56.779 align:start position:0%
to you
 
03:54:01.729 --> 03:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
ours is similar maybe a couple of tweaks
 
03:54:03.469 --> 03:54:03.479 align:start position:0%
um certainly
 
03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
um and and line four of the bill where
 
03:54:12.050 --> 03:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
it has the threshold of 15 employees
 
03:54:12.060 --> 03:54:13.550 align:start position:0%
it has the threshold of 15 employees
um

03:54:13.550 --> 03:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:16.010 --> 03:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the right number is
 
03:54:18.530 --> 03:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
but the concern would be once that is
 
03:54:21.229 --> 03:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
put into statute that that number could
 
03:54:23.630 --> 03:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
be lowered over time and that could have
 
03:54:26.809 --> 03:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
an impact on many many very very small
 
03:54:30.130 --> 03:54:30.140 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:54:34.490 --> 03:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
and in those lines four five six I think
 
03:54:38.389 --> 03:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
it's important that it's recognized that
 
03:54:40.849 --> 03:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
if there is a written policy that a
 
03:54:42.590 --> 03:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
business has
 
03:54:45.229 --> 03:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
but somewhat of a contract between the
 
03:54:48.530 --> 03:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
employer and the employee that there's a
 
03:54:50.929 --> 03:54:50.939 align:start position:0%
true understanding between the two of
 
03:54:53.530 --> 03:54:53.540 align:start position:0%
what rights each side has
 
03:54:53.540 --> 03:54:55.429 align:start position:0%
what rights each side has
and

03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:55:00.590 --> 03:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
um if that unearned time is delineated
 
03:55:04.910 --> 03:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
is is explained within that policy at
 
03:55:07.729 --> 03:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
and and says you can't take it with you
 
03:55:10.189 --> 03:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
or you can take it with you I think
 
03:55:12.650 --> 03:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
that's what should dictate
 
03:55:15.469 --> 03:55:15.479 align:start position:0%
the policy for that employee it should
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
not be State Statute it should be that
 
03:55:19.910 --> 03:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
relationship between the employer and
 
03:55:22.250 --> 03:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
the employee and not having the state of
 
03:55:25.070 --> 03:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire dictating what the policy
 
03:55:25.080 --> 03:55:26.450 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire dictating what the policy
is

03:55:26.450 --> 03:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:55:28.910 --> 03:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
and and I think that Mr juvet also
 
03:55:31.010 --> 03:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
brought up a very very good point on
 
03:55:34.070 --> 03:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
line 17 where if the person leaves in
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
good standing that really emphasizes the
 
03:55:40.070 --> 03:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
the concern that I just expressed in
 
03:55:41.929 --> 03:55:41.939 align:start position:0%
terms of that relationship between the
 
03:55:44.330 --> 03:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
employer employee if that person in good
 
03:55:47.030 --> 03:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
standing makes the decision to leave
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
and the policy lays out that they cannot
 
03:55:51.729 --> 03:55:51.739 align:start position:0%
take their
 
03:55:55.610 --> 03:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
unused earned income or earned time with
 
03:55:55.620 --> 03:55:56.469 align:start position:0%
unused earned income or earned time with
them

03:55:56.469 --> 03:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:56:00.530 --> 03:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
then they don't get it and and so I
 
03:56:02.450 --> 03:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
think that you know it has to be
 
03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
carefully crafted
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:56:08.450 --> 03:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
it isn't the state just stepping in and
 
03:56:08.460 --> 03:56:09.710 align:start position:0%
it isn't the state just stepping in and
saying

03:56:09.710 --> 03:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:56:11.570 --> 03:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
Mr business owner
 
03:56:13.610 --> 03:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
Mrs business owner this is the way you
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
have to do it
 
03:56:16.969 --> 03:56:16.979 align:start position:0%
I think it there needs to be that
 
03:56:19.250 --> 03:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
flexibility between the employer and the
 
03:56:22.969 --> 03:56:22.979 align:start position:0%
employee especially especially for very
 
03:56:25.189 --> 03:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
small businesses in the state
 
03:56:27.769 --> 03:56:27.779 align:start position:0%
with that I'll conclude my remarks and
 
03:56:29.389 --> 03:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
be happy to try and address any
 
03:56:31.070 --> 03:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
questions you may have right thank you
 
03:56:34.490 --> 03:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:37.010 --> 03:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
all right represent McKenzie thank you
 
03:56:37.020 --> 03:56:37.969 align:start position:0%
all right represent McKenzie thank you
um

03:56:37.969 --> 03:56:37.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
so what standing does a person have uh
 
03:56:43.070 --> 03:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
you talk about the relationship between
 
03:56:45.769 --> 03:56:45.779 align:start position:0%
employer employees that they they have a
 
03:56:48.530 --> 03:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
contract they use uh an agreement so
 
03:56:52.370 --> 03:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
yeah so what um what jurisdiction in the
 
03:56:53.689 --> 03:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
labor department is here they might be
 
03:56:55.189 --> 03:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
able to answer this but do they have
 
03:56:57.950 --> 03:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
standing under the law to be able to
 
03:56:59.630 --> 03:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
challenge that in a case where they have
 
03:57:03.530 --> 03:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
an agreement that has been worked out uh
 
03:57:06.050 --> 03:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
where they have you know clear
 
03:57:07.849 --> 03:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
um understanding and the employer does
 
03:57:11.929 --> 03:57:11.939 align:start position:0%
not abide by the uh by the document well
 
03:57:14.510 --> 03:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
if there's a clear written policy
 
03:57:16.490 --> 03:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
but you know between the employer and
 
03:57:19.429 --> 03:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
the employee and that employer violates
 
03:57:22.429 --> 03:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
that policy I would think they would you
 
03:57:24.530 --> 03:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
know definitely be an opportunity to
 
03:57:27.889 --> 03:57:27.899 align:start position:0%
contest that at the Department of Labor
 
03:57:29.450 --> 03:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
um but I think that you know that needs
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:34.370 --> 03:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I guess that's a question
 
03:57:36.530 --> 03:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
for the Department yes and he he will be
 
03:57:38.809 --> 03:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
coming up next terrific thank you very
 
03:57:41.929 --> 03:57:41.939 align:start position:0%
much thank you are there other questions
 
03:57:41.939 --> 03:57:45.710 align:start position:0%
much thank you are there other questions
yes

03:57:45.710 --> 03:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
03:57:47.279 --> 03:57:48.290 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
Burkey

03:57:48.290 --> 03:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
Burkey
 
03:57:52.309 --> 03:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
um online six
 
03:57:55.250 --> 03:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
um if upon reading it
 
03:57:57.889 --> 03:57:57.899 align:start position:0%
say If an employer under at 15 or more
 
03:58:00.590 --> 03:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
does not have an accrual policy
 
03:58:02.689 --> 03:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
it looks like current time shall be paid
 
03:58:05.630 --> 03:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
in a prorated basis is that is that
 
03:58:08.150 --> 03:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
starting a benefit for that because
 
03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
there's no policy or is that
 
03:58:12.530 --> 03:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
delineating what a cruel and earned time
 
03:58:12.540 --> 03:58:13.309 align:start position:0%
delineating what a cruel and earned time
is

03:58:13.309 --> 03:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
I was just want your take on that
 
03:58:20.570 --> 03:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if there's 15 or more if
 
03:58:23.689 --> 03:58:23.699 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding reading this that
 
03:58:25.849 --> 03:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
if I'm an employer with 15 or more
 
03:58:28.309 --> 03:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
employees that I must have that written
 
03:58:28.319 --> 03:58:29.870 align:start position:0%
employees that I must have that written
policy

03:58:29.870 --> 03:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:58:31.729 --> 03:58:31.739 align:start position:0%
and and to your earlier question
 
03:58:33.370 --> 03:58:33.380 align:start position:0%
representative Abalone
 
03:58:36.050 --> 03:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
when you were asking about the seasonal
 
03:58:36.060 --> 03:58:37.969 align:start position:0%
when you were asking about the seasonal
individual

03:58:37.969 --> 03:58:37.979 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that that too could be a part
 
03:58:42.889 --> 03:58:42.899 align:start position:0%
of that policy
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the relationship between
 
03:58:50.330 --> 03:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:53.510 --> 03:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you for clarifying that and if
 
03:58:55.429 --> 03:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
the employee happens to go back to the
 
03:58:55.439 --> 03:58:56.809 align:start position:0%
the employee happens to go back to the
employer

03:58:56.809 --> 03:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:58:58.670 --> 03:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
always panel all their time and they're
 
03:59:00.650 --> 03:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
starting again this would eliminate the
 
03:59:02.210 --> 03:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
ability for that employee to say okay
 
03:59:03.950 --> 03:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
well hold on to my vacation time I know
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
what's a month laid off you know I'll
 
03:59:08.689 --> 03:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
you know we can hold it over until I
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
tell I'm rehired because you know it's
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
the form of four weeks off because they
 
03:59:14.750 --> 03:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
shut down or something like that would
 
03:59:16.490 --> 03:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
that eliminate that ability for that
 
03:59:18.410 --> 03:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
employee and an employer to enter into
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
that agreement
 
03:59:23.389 --> 03:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
I would have to think about that I'm not
 
03:59:25.610 --> 03:59:25.620 align:start position:0%
sure all right thank you sorry
 
03:59:27.889 --> 03:59:27.899 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
colcom is that nope okay
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other questions so thank
 
03:59:34.670 --> 03:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
 
03:59:34.680 --> 03:59:35.689 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
you

03:59:35.689 --> 03:59:35.699 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:59:37.969 --> 03:59:37.979 align:start position:0%
um and as I said I have one final card
 
03:59:41.269 --> 03:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
if someone could pass the blue sheet for
 
03:59:43.689 --> 03:59:43.699 align:start position:0%
HB 74 forward
 
03:59:47.570 --> 03:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
and we welcome Deputy Commissioner Ogden
 
03:59:50.510 --> 03:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Labor
 
03:59:52.670 --> 03:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative seaworth uh for
 
03:59:54.530 --> 03:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
the record Rudy Ogden uh Department of
 
03:59:54.540 --> 03:59:55.550 align:start position:0%
the record Rudy Ogden uh Department of
Labor

03:59:55.550 --> 03:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
Labor
 
03:59:56.570 --> 03:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
um I'll just go through some of the
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
questions that have come up obviously if
 
03:59:59.929 --> 03:59:59.939 align:start position:0%
there's other questions I'm happy to
 
04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
take those as well
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
um first in reference to uh commissioner
 
04:00:06.290 --> 04:00:06.300 align:start position:0%
Rawlings House's Point uh following
 
04:00:07.550 --> 04:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
along with what he said while I
 
04:00:08.929 --> 04:00:08.939 align:start position:0%
ultimately agree that it could be and
 
04:00:10.849 --> 04:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
would be disputed between attorneys I
 
04:00:12.769 --> 04:00:12.779 align:start position:0%
think ultimately his question about how
 
04:00:14.630 --> 04:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
it would be handled for payout of those
 
04:00:17.389 --> 04:00:17.399 align:start position:0%
folks uh that he said they're paid the
 
04:00:19.849 --> 04:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
three days for years of service we would
 
04:00:21.650 --> 04:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
see that as not being problematic
 
04:00:23.450 --> 04:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
relative to this language this language
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
for the proposed legislation does not
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
seem to create a new benefit since
 
04:00:29.450 --> 04:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
instead speaking to instances in which
 
04:00:31.790 --> 04:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
there is a benefit provided so if the
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
present payout process for separated
 
04:00:36.290 --> 04:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
employees from unclassified Services is
 
04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
they get three days of pay that's not
 
04:00:42.469 --> 04:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
creating earn time or on on time that is
 
04:00:44.330 --> 04:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
unused rather it's just creating a
 
04:00:46.550 --> 04:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
payout at separation so I don't see that
 
04:00:48.349 --> 04:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
as being problematic to be clear
 
04:00:51.110 --> 04:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately it could be disputed speaking
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
to disputes representative avalani's or
 
04:00:55.309 --> 04:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
the question had come about but if is
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
there I forget who would ask that
 
04:00:58.969 --> 04:00:58.979 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie about uh is
 
04:01:00.830 --> 04:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
there opportunity or standing for folks
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
presently that is what happens and what
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
I mean by uh that's what happens now is
 
04:01:07.910 --> 04:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
right now existing law as was stead
 
04:01:10.250 --> 04:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
stated by representative Cahill is that
 
04:01:12.290 --> 04:01:12.300 align:start position:0%
policy controls policy or practice
 
04:01:14.510 --> 04:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
control so if an employer has written
 
04:01:16.849 --> 04:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
policy or has a standing practice or
 
04:01:18.830 --> 04:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's a combination of both policy and
 
04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
practice that is what controls if the
 
04:01:23.929 --> 04:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
employee feels as though that has been
 
04:01:25.670 --> 04:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
violated or something has not happened
 
04:01:27.769 --> 04:01:27.779 align:start position:0%
that should have happened they can and
 
04:01:29.630 --> 04:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
do file wage claims with the Department
 
04:01:32.570 --> 04:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
as representative Cahill brought up we
 
04:01:34.910 --> 04:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
frequently are called on these issues as
 
04:01:36.530 --> 04:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
you might imagine when folks separate
 
04:01:38.990 --> 04:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
from an employment they oftentimes say
 
04:01:41.809 --> 04:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
well what happens to my time even if the
 
04:01:43.670 --> 04:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
employer has a policy I will say a lot
 
04:01:44.929 --> 04:01:44.939 align:start position:0%
of employees
 
04:01:46.910 --> 04:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
they might not read the policy they
 
04:01:48.889 --> 04:01:48.899 align:start position:0%
might not fully understand the policy or
 
04:01:50.689 --> 04:01:50.699 align:start position:0%
they might just disagree with the policy
 
04:01:52.610 --> 04:01:52.620 align:start position:0%
so again we get a lot of calls of the
 
04:01:54.050 --> 04:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
calls that we get a certain number
 
04:01:56.570 --> 04:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
ultimately do result in hearings so to
 
04:01:58.490 --> 04:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
be clear there presently is a process or
 
04:02:00.830 --> 04:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
a platform in place whereby individuals
 
04:02:03.610 --> 04:02:03.620 align:start position:0%
can have those disputes uh brought out
 
04:02:05.929 --> 04:02:05.939 align:start position:0%
representative avalani your question
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
about the line in line seven and eight
 
04:02:11.090 --> 04:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
in the absence of an accrual system earn
 
04:02:13.010 --> 04:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
time shall be paid on a prorated basis
 
04:02:15.410 --> 04:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
again the Department's position on that
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
reading this language as is is not that
 
04:02:19.729 --> 04:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
that creates a new benefit we would see
 
04:02:21.410 --> 04:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
that language as being simply
 
04:02:23.570 --> 04:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
informative for purposes of how the
 
04:02:26.150 --> 04:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
payout under 5A would happen we're just
 
04:02:28.010 --> 04:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
seeing that it's not saying okay even if
 
04:02:30.110 --> 04:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
they don't get time they're going to get
 
04:02:32.030 --> 04:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
this payout we would see it as saying in
 
04:02:34.250 --> 04:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
5A it talks about there being a payout
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
and we would look at the language above
 
04:02:38.530 --> 04:02:38.540 align:start position:0%
and saying okay if they if it's not
 
04:02:40.910 --> 04:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
accrued there's going to be a proration
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
of the payout based on how long they've
 
04:02:43.790 --> 04:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
been there
 
04:02:45.590 --> 04:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to the only other thing I
 
04:02:47.150 --> 04:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
would point out and this wasn't directly
 
04:02:49.490 --> 04:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
asked but it's come up in previous
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
um iterations of this bill is the uh
 
04:02:54.650 --> 04:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
instances or occasions in which there is
 
04:02:56.929 --> 04:02:56.939 align:start position:0%
an acquisition or a company changes
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
hands that does come up and just to be
 
04:03:01.070 --> 04:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
clear what the department can and cannot
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
do if a new entity buys an existing
 
04:03:06.349 --> 04:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
employer we are not entitled or
 
04:03:09.110 --> 04:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
authorized to then hold past practice
 
04:03:11.570 --> 04:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
against the new entity we can and do go
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
after that old employer but oftentimes
 
04:03:15.889 --> 04:03:15.899 align:start position:0%
as you might imagine when someone sells
 
04:03:17.990 --> 04:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
their business The Entity that's been
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
sold that becomes defunct and it is
 
04:03:23.150 --> 04:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
difficult to get money out of a defunct
 
04:03:24.590 --> 04:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
entity but to be clear the department
 
04:03:27.530 --> 04:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
can't go to the new employer and say new
 
04:03:29.809 --> 04:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
employer you're on the hook for time
 
04:03:31.849 --> 04:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
that should have been paid out so I just
 
04:03:32.990 --> 04:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
want to be clear because that question
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
has come up in the past of how we handle
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
those instances again what we would do
 
04:03:40.189 --> 04:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
now is if the policy was that time
 
04:03:41.929 --> 04:03:41.939 align:start position:0%
should have been paid out we would look
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
to hold the old employer reliable but
 
04:03:47.090 --> 04:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
that's not always possible especially if
 
04:03:49.429 --> 04:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
they dissolve or in some other way
 
04:03:49.439 --> 04:03:50.809 align:start position:0%
they dissolve or in some other way
disappear

04:03:50.809 --> 04:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
disappear
 
04:03:53.570 --> 04:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to take any other questions
 
04:03:56.450 --> 04:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
all right thank you other questions
 
04:03:59.210 --> 04:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
can you um give us your opinion about uh
 
04:04:04.370 --> 04:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
04:04:07.250 --> 04:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
the contracts come in different forms
 
04:04:09.170 --> 04:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
the written contracts and then there are
 
04:04:11.330 --> 04:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
oral contracts verbal contracts it can
 
04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
be they can be agreed to by employers
 
04:04:15.950 --> 04:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
and employees have you ever had a
 
04:04:17.809 --> 04:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
instance where there was a verbal
 
04:04:20.090 --> 04:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
contract that came before the department
 
04:04:22.790 --> 04:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
no I think most off the top of my head I
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
can't remember one most often if it's
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
not written then what happens is the
 
04:04:28.670 --> 04:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
practice is what is referenced so it's
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
instead of saying what was said the
 
04:04:32.510 --> 04:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
first day I was hired they look at what
 
04:04:34.010 --> 04:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
happened when other people separated
 
04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
from employment so representative
 
04:04:36.889 --> 04:04:36.899 align:start position:0%
McKenzie I can't say that that's never
 
04:04:39.410 --> 04:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
happened but in my direct recollection I
 
04:04:41.870 --> 04:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
can't remember us going off of a verbal
 
04:04:41.880 --> 04:04:44.410 align:start position:0%
can't remember us going off of a verbal
only

04:04:44.410 --> 04:04:44.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:47.150 --> 04:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
one quick follow-up follow-up so the
 
04:04:50.090 --> 04:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
burden then become is on the employee to
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
prove past practice correct or the
 
04:04:53.750 --> 04:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
department if it was something the
 
04:04:55.309 --> 04:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
department was doing on its own motion
 
04:04:58.189 --> 04:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
04:04:58.199 --> 04:05:01.370 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
representative

04:05:01.370 --> 04:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:03.170 --> 04:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good to see you
 
04:05:05.450 --> 04:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
again commissioner
 
04:05:05.460 --> 04:05:06.290 align:start position:0%
again commissioner
um

04:05:06.290 --> 04:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:06.300 --> 04:05:08.750 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:05:08.750 --> 04:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:11.290 --> 04:05:11.300 align:start position:0%
some employers front load their time
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
earn time vacation time or anything like
 
04:05:13.920 --> 04:05:15.050 align:start position:0%
earn time vacation time or anything like
that

04:05:15.050 --> 04:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
um under this would they be entitled to
 
04:05:18.769 --> 04:05:18.779 align:start position:0%
the full amount
 
04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
um say they loaded up on January 1st say
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
February 1st they quit would they be
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
entitled to their full complement of
 
04:05:28.010 --> 04:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
earn time even though they technically
 
04:05:30.769 --> 04:05:30.779 align:start position:0%
haven't accrued it and again I think
 
04:05:32.750 --> 04:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
that is what the language in seven and
 
04:05:34.610 --> 04:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
eight are speaking to is that if there
 
04:05:37.370 --> 04:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
was some front loading so if it was a a
 
04:05:40.490 --> 04:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know one tranche given uh at January
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
1st where again in seven and eight where
 
04:05:44.030 --> 04:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
it says in the absence of an accrual
 
04:05:45.769 --> 04:05:45.779 align:start position:0%
system earn time should be paid on a
 
04:05:48.170 --> 04:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
prorated basis I believe that the payout
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
would be prorated I believe that's the
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
intent of that language certainly I
 
04:05:52.370 --> 04:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
don't mean to speak for representative
 
04:05:54.170 --> 04:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
Cahill but that's the Department's
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:01.130 --> 04:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
any further questions yes representative
 
04:06:03.530 --> 04:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:06:06.590 --> 04:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
um Deputy Commissioner do you think that
 
04:06:09.769 --> 04:06:09.779 align:start position:0%
if this passed it would make a company
 
04:06:12.769 --> 04:06:12.779 align:start position:0%
aware of the law and probably recognize
 
04:06:15.769 --> 04:06:15.779 align:start position:0%
the problem before they sold it or would
 
04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
interesting question I'm not sure if I
 
04:06:22.969 --> 04:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
can fully answer that I will say that
 
04:06:24.590 --> 04:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
there have been instances where we've
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
dealt with employers that
 
04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
they're not thinking of that in the
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
process of selling their company it does
 
04:06:32.570 --> 04:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
not come to mind so I don't know if that
 
04:06:34.969 --> 04:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
answers the question I can say it has
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
come up where it's been something
 
04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
overlooked oftentimes people selling
 
04:06:40.429 --> 04:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
their companies there's a lot going on
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot they're trying to figure
 
04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
out and sometimes this is an issue
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's lost
 
04:06:47.929 --> 04:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman but but
 
04:06:50.269 --> 04:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
by passing this there'll be one more
 
04:06:52.370 --> 04:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
thing for them to look at before they
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
sold the company so they would be aware
 
04:06:56.030 --> 04:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
of it
 
04:06:58.370 --> 04:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
or they would recognize it and do
 
04:07:00.349 --> 04:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
something about it
 
04:07:02.450 --> 04:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
correct I guess yes it would be an
 
04:07:05.150 --> 04:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
obligation to look at it thank you
 
04:07:05.160 --> 04:07:06.950 align:start position:0%
obligation to look at it thank you
representative

04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:08.870 --> 04:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for Mr
 
04:07:10.729 --> 04:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
for uh taking my question
 
04:07:13.849 --> 04:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
if this law were to pass in the case of
 
04:07:16.130 --> 04:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
a company sale where the old entity is
 
04:07:18.349 --> 04:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
going defunct do you think this law
 
04:07:20.389 --> 04:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
would help at all or would the defunct
 
04:07:22.370 --> 04:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
entity still be you wouldn't be able to
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
get payouts from them even if this law
 
04:07:25.969 --> 04:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
existed and it was more clear that they
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:30.290 --> 04:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
there could still there could always be
 
04:07:32.210 --> 04:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
difficulties in collect I mean anytime
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
you're trying to assert or uh seek
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
recovery of monies there's always
 
04:07:37.849 --> 04:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
difficulties in collecting those so I
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
imagine there would still or could still
 
04:07:42.349 --> 04:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
be difficulties I think the uh most
 
04:07:44.030 --> 04:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
important piece in terms of what's
 
04:07:46.010 --> 04:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
operative language here is the fact that
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's strictly saying if there is one of
 
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
these transitions in ownership uh it
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
should be taken care of before that is
 
04:07:55.729 --> 04:07:55.739 align:start position:0%
fully effectuated I understand what
 
04:07:57.290 --> 04:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
you're saying if it's ignored it would
 
04:07:58.969 --> 04:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
it would still be an issue to collect
 
04:08:01.130 --> 04:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
04:08:02.809 --> 04:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
do you see that language in the bill
 
04:08:04.070 --> 04:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
that says it should be taken care of
 
04:08:05.809 --> 04:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
part of the transition as imposing a
 
04:08:08.210 --> 04:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
requirement on the new company the per
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
the company that's acquiring it is there
 
04:08:10.319 --> 04:08:11.330 align:start position:0%
the company that's acquiring it is there
a

04:08:11.330 --> 04:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
is there a responsibility for the new
 
04:08:14.570 --> 04:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
company now being created by this bill
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
no the only responsibility I see here is
 
04:08:18.889 --> 04:08:18.899 align:start position:0%
where it talks about the fact that the
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
time could be transitioned over if
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's how it was arranged then it would
 
04:08:25.849 --> 04:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
be viewed as the new company taking on
 
04:08:27.889 --> 04:08:27.899 align:start position:0%
that responsibility but I don't see this
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
language as imputing responsibility to
 
04:08:32.450 --> 04:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
the new entity to take on the liability
 
04:08:35.389 --> 04:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
for payout thank you
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:42.650 --> 04:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so if if the old
 
04:08:44.990 --> 04:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
company sold because there was a
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy coming up and they sold their
 
04:08:47.520 --> 04:08:48.710 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy coming up and they sold their
assets

04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
assets
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
would these people be entitled to a
 
04:08:55.729 --> 04:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
claim such as lost wages of lost earned
 
04:08:55.739 --> 04:08:57.229 align:start position:0%
claim such as lost wages of lost earned
wages

04:08:57.229 --> 04:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
wages
 
04:08:58.969 --> 04:08:58.979 align:start position:0%
would it be into that category of
 
04:09:00.769 --> 04:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
thinking of bankruptcy
 
04:09:02.510 --> 04:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
I mean if there's owed money in the
 
04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
context of a bankruptcy they they would
 
04:09:05.990 --> 04:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
be entitled to file a claim in terms of
 
04:09:07.790 --> 04:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
order of Precedence I'm not a bankruptcy
 
04:09:09.410 --> 04:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
expert but I don't so I don't know how
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
that would sort out but if they they're
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
deemed which they would be deemed as
 
04:09:15.710 --> 04:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
owed money they'd be creditors they
 
04:09:17.450 --> 04:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
they'd have a claim that could be filed
 
04:09:20.269 --> 04:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
arguably all right thank you
 
04:09:23.689 --> 04:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:26.510 --> 04:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
I see no further questions so thank you
 
04:09:28.969 --> 04:09:28.979 align:start position:0%
very much for your contribution that was
 
04:09:31.520 --> 04:09:31.530 align:start position:0%
the final card on this
 
04:09:31.530 --> 04:09:32.150 align:start position:0%
the final card on this
[Music]

04:09:32.150 --> 04:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:09:32.160 --> 04:09:32.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:37.090 --> 04:09:37.100 align:start position:0%
I'll read out we have online 16 people
 
04:09:40.670 --> 04:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
signed in to support this bill none were
 
04:09:40.680 --> 04:09:41.929 align:start position:0%
signed in to support this bill none were
opposed

04:09:41.929 --> 04:09:41.939 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
04:09:45.290 --> 04:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
and in person seven people signed in
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
support and two were opposed
 
04:09:51.530 --> 04:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
and with that I will close the hearing
 
04:09:56.330 --> 04:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
on HB 74 our next hearing for hb82
 
04:09:58.969 --> 04:09:58.979 align:start position:0%
starts at 2 30 so we'll stand in recess
 
04:30:20.889 --> 04:30:20.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:24.670 --> 04:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
it looks like 2 30 so if we can get
 
04:30:34.910 --> 04:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:38.990 --> 04:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
so I will open the hearing on HB 82 this
 
04:30:40.849 --> 04:30:40.859 align:start position:0%
is relative to employment protection for
 
04:30:42.889 --> 04:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
participants in the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:30:42.899 --> 04:30:44.030 align:start position:0%
participants in the therapeutic cannabis
program

04:30:44.030 --> 04:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:30:47.630 --> 04:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
and I would ask the sponsor
 
04:30:50.149 --> 04:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative Vale to introduce the
 
04:30:52.189 --> 04:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
04:30:55.250 --> 04:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
um if you haven't if a pink card isn't
 
04:30:56.990 --> 04:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
on the way before you leave make sure
 
04:30:59.689 --> 04:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
you fill out a pink card for the record
 
04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.189 --> 04:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%

County six and I'm here today to ask
 
04:31:19.309 --> 04:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
your committee to consider my bill House
 
04:31:22.010 --> 04:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
Bill 82 which will give relief to
 
04:31:24.110 --> 04:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
patients of the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:31:26.210 --> 04:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
program by sending the bill to the state
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
house floor with a positive
 
04:31:28.080 --> 04:31:30.290 align:start position:0%
house floor with a positive
recommendation

04:31:30.290 --> 04:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
04:31:31.790 --> 04:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
um you may be familiar with this bill
 
04:31:33.710 --> 04:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
has come before the committee I don't
 
04:31:35.570 --> 04:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
believe the last term but the term
 
04:31:35.580 --> 04:31:37.250 align:start position:0%
believe the last term but the term
before

04:31:37.250 --> 04:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:31:39.110 --> 04:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and I just wanted to let you know
 
04:31:40.910 --> 04:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm open to working on this bill
 
04:31:43.849 --> 04:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
and to any amendments that you may find
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
necessary to put this in the place where
 
04:31:50.030 --> 04:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
the Bill's intent is most represented in
 
04:31:53.570 --> 04:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:56.570 --> 04:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
some some states uh protect employees
 
04:31:58.490 --> 04:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
who participate in their therapeutic
 
04:32:01.309 --> 04:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis programs but in that in New
 
04:32:02.990 --> 04:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are no explicit
 
04:32:05.090 --> 04:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
protection for programs for employees
 
04:32:07.969 --> 04:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
who participate in our state's program
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
they may be at risk of termination or
 
04:32:13.790 --> 04:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
other adverse employment actions if
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
their participation is discovered versus
 
04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledged and as legitimate Medical
 
04:32:21.349 --> 04:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
Care where they're covered under HIPAA
 
04:32:23.030 --> 04:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
Provisions they're not covered
 
04:32:25.370 --> 04:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
necessarily if they have a positive
 
04:32:27.469 --> 04:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
urine screen during their employment
 
04:32:29.450 --> 04:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
pre-screening process or in the course
 
04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
of their employment when these tests are
 
04:32:35.149 --> 04:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
acknowledged as necessary and
 
04:32:37.729 --> 04:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
contributed to their humans or human
 
04:32:37.739 --> 04:32:39.050 align:start position:0%
contributed to their humans or human
resources

04:32:39.050 --> 04:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
resources
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
portfolio on the person typically during
 
04:32:45.469 --> 04:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
a urine drug screening where there are
 
04:32:48.349 --> 04:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
substances that are prescribed
 
04:32:51.170 --> 04:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
are only are detected the lab will call
 
04:32:53.570 --> 04:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
you and they will ask you
 
04:32:55.550 --> 04:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
um is there a reason why this medication
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
is in your you have a prescription can
 
04:32:59.889 --> 04:32:59.899 align:start position:0%
you provide us with information
 
04:33:02.809 --> 04:33:02.819 align:start position:0%
this is a pre-employment drugs cleaning
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
we are required to release these results
 
04:33:09.709 --> 04:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
to your potential employer and when the
 
04:33:11.869 --> 04:33:11.879 align:start position:0%
potential employer gets these results
 
04:33:14.810 --> 04:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
they're going to see this substance on
 
04:33:18.410 --> 04:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:18.420 --> 04:33:19.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:33:19.970 --> 04:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:22.429 --> 04:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
so when you're not able to do that
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
you send this proof to the lab but when
 
04:33:26.449 --> 04:33:26.459 align:start position:0%
you're not able to do that we don't have
 
04:33:28.849 --> 04:33:28.859 align:start position:0%
a provision in the law then we can't ask
 
04:33:31.609 --> 04:33:31.619 align:start position:0%
for a lab to clear us for therapeutic
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
cannabis to work in an industry where
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
that is not necessarily
 
04:33:37.680 --> 04:33:39.529 align:start position:0%
that is not necessarily
um indicated

04:33:39.529 --> 04:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
um indicated
 
04:33:42.051 --> 04:33:42.061 align:start position:0%
there are places in the statute on
 
04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and I have sent you
 
04:33:49.490 --> 04:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
around a handout that has
 
04:33:52.730 --> 04:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
information on the restrictions that are
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
already placed on people that are
 
04:33:56.330 --> 04:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
participating in the therapeutic
 
04:33:58.490 --> 04:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
cannabis program in the law
 
04:34:02.631 --> 04:34:02.641 align:start position:0%
so as far as contradictions or
 
04:34:05.150 --> 04:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
contraindications between certain types
 
04:34:06.890 --> 04:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
of Labor and certain types of heavy
 
04:34:09.131 --> 04:34:09.141 align:start position:0%
equipment these things are enumerated
 
04:34:12.590 --> 04:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
and the um the process for
 
04:34:15.830 --> 04:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
storing keeping managing and using your
 
04:34:17.570 --> 04:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
medication are really up to you like
 
04:34:20.631 --> 04:34:20.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:20.641 --> 04:34:22.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
here's my story this actually came up
 
04:34:26.810 --> 04:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
for me as an issue
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
and I am a patient in the therapeutic
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis program in the state of New
 
04:34:34.849 --> 04:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I have been since 2017.
 
04:34:37.131 --> 04:34:37.141 align:start position:0%
a urine test was required by a company
 
04:34:38.990 --> 04:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
then I wanted to work for over the
 
04:34:39.000 --> 04:34:40.250 align:start position:0%
then I wanted to work for over the
summer

04:34:40.250 --> 04:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
summer
 
04:34:44.390 --> 04:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
and it this company was based out of New
 
04:34:44.400 --> 04:34:45.529 align:start position:0%
and it this company was based out of New
Jersey

04:34:45.529 --> 04:34:45.539 align:start position:0%
Jersey
 
04:34:48.890 --> 04:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
New Jersey has laws in place where they
 
04:34:51.230 --> 04:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
protect medical cannabis participants
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
from discrimination in the workplace
 
04:34:56.390 --> 04:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
they have a thing called the Jake honig
 
04:34:58.970 --> 04:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
compassionate use medical cannabis act
 
04:35:02.090 --> 04:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
signed into law in 2019 and that
 
04:35:04.849 --> 04:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
prohibits employers from taking adverse
 
04:35:07.310 --> 04:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
employment actions against employees who
 
04:35:10.429 --> 04:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
are medical cannabis participants
 
04:35:13.250 --> 04:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
this includes non-hiring terminating or
 
04:35:14.750 --> 04:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise discriminating against
 
04:35:17.269 --> 04:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
employees based on their status as a
 
04:35:19.490 --> 04:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis participant
 
04:35:21.890 --> 04:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
they are also employers are also
 
04:35:23.449 --> 04:35:23.459 align:start position:0%
prohibited from taking adverse
 
04:35:26.209 --> 04:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
employment actions against someone on a
 
04:35:28.910 --> 04:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
positive drug test and the use is in
 
04:35:31.789 --> 04:35:31.799 align:start position:0%
compliance with the State Medical
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
program is taken into consideration
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
so in my case nonetheless I went and I
 
04:35:40.131 --> 04:35:40.141 align:start position:0%
did the urine specimen the employee
 
04:35:43.369 --> 04:35:43.379 align:start position:0%
reported that they would like to take my
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
my test which the company had to report
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
to this potential employer in New Jersey
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
and they could not exclude it they said
 
04:35:55.609 --> 04:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
we can't clear you for this so I I said
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
we'll just go ahead and we'll see what
 
04:35:58.910 --> 04:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
happens and if they don't want to hire
 
04:36:00.890 --> 04:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
somebody based on their own state law
 
04:36:02.810 --> 04:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
and they don't want to protect people
 
04:36:04.910 --> 04:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
who are working remotely based on their
 
04:36:07.849 --> 04:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
own state law we can at least look at at
 
04:36:10.369 --> 04:36:10.379 align:start position:0%
what's going on with ours
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
so I waited and I waited three weeks
 
04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
three and a half weeks and this is time
 
04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
where I could have used the income and I
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
was hired but I never felt like the same
 
04:36:24.230 --> 04:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
as if I hadn't opened my medical record
 
04:36:28.010 --> 04:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
to my potential employer and I felt that
 
04:36:30.170 --> 04:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
this was a way of trying to reduce risk
 
04:36:32.631 --> 04:36:32.641 align:start position:0%
at a time when we really need people in
 
04:36:34.730 --> 04:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
the workforce that have skills and know
 
04:36:36.470 --> 04:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
how to do a good job and that
 
04:36:39.310 --> 04:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
discriminate to somebody on the basis of
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis when it is part of your medical
 
04:36:44.750 --> 04:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
regimen and in many cases a very serious
 
04:36:44.760 --> 04:36:46.730 align:start position:0%
regimen and in many cases a very serious
illnesses

04:36:46.730 --> 04:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
illnesses
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
um that can only be controlled in some
 
04:36:50.631 --> 04:36:50.641 align:start position:0%
ways in this manner
 
04:36:53.570 --> 04:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
so in this Society where we hire and
 
04:36:55.369 --> 04:36:55.379 align:start position:0%
fire according to a patchwork of state
 
04:36:58.429 --> 04:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
laws we have to refer to how others
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
states have solved this problem
 
04:37:03.109 --> 04:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
we don't want to systematically reject
 
04:37:06.170 --> 04:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
people or workers in a world that we
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
can't keep up the Business Without
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
humans right now we're really suffering
 
04:37:11.810 --> 04:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the people between
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
the machines and because we lost many
 
04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
laborers to this pandemic
 
04:37:20.810 --> 04:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
it's all a big it's all a big um
 
04:37:23.209 --> 04:37:23.219 align:start position:0%
recipe where we need workers and that's
 
04:37:25.070 --> 04:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
what we have to focus on how much we
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
need workers
 
04:37:30.051 --> 04:37:30.061 align:start position:0%
there are several folks here to testify
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
today what I wound up doing in response
 
04:37:37.551 --> 04:37:37.561 align:start position:0%
to my situation was I contacted OLS and
 
04:37:39.289 --> 04:37:39.299 align:start position:0%
I said I think there was a bill in the
 
04:37:41.590 --> 04:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
past that was filed that had cannabis
 
04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
protections for people who want to use
 
04:37:46.910 --> 04:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic or you just even want to
 
04:37:48.769 --> 04:37:48.779 align:start position:0%
try it to try to get their lifelong
 
04:37:50.929 --> 04:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
problem under control so that they can
 
04:37:52.670 --> 04:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
continue to work and not lose their jobs
 
04:37:55.189 --> 04:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
they can embark on it in the middle of
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
employment and it doesn't have to be a
 
04:37:58.970 --> 04:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
conversation the person has with the
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
employer when they walk in the door
 
04:38:03.769 --> 04:38:03.779 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't have a lasting effect
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
like the job I left because it just was
 
04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable after
 
04:38:12.289 --> 04:38:12.299 align:start position:0%
having waited to see if they approved me
 
04:38:14.990 --> 04:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
or not knowing how qualified I was
 
04:38:17.090 --> 04:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
so again there are several folks here to
 
04:38:19.551 --> 04:38:19.561 align:start position:0%
testify today and if I have said
 
04:38:21.170 --> 04:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
anything that they need to correct I've
 
04:38:23.150 --> 04:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
asked them to do that and if you have
 
04:38:25.849 --> 04:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
other questions we'll be listening While
 
04:38:28.910 --> 04:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
others testify I'm happy to take
 
04:38:31.070 --> 04:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
questions it turned out that I had been
 
04:38:33.410 --> 04:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor on this bill and I did not
 
04:38:36.310 --> 04:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
remember that I had
 
04:38:38.631 --> 04:38:38.641 align:start position:0%
and the primary sponsor was
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas who I would
 
04:38:42.830 --> 04:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
like to give most of the credit for this
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
bill because if it it just would never
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
have occurred to me and I was like wait
 
04:38:48.650 --> 04:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
a minute we need to do something about
 
04:38:52.131 --> 04:38:52.141 align:start position:0%
this especially when it hits home and I
 
04:38:54.590 --> 04:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
am so sorry that it wasn't somebody that
 
04:38:56.869 --> 04:38:56.879 align:start position:0%
came to me it was me that came to me but
 
04:38:58.609 --> 04:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
I can tell by the interest in this bill
 
04:39:00.349 --> 04:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
that this is affecting other people and
 
04:39:02.631 --> 04:39:02.641 align:start position:0%
they wanted you to consider it so again
 
04:39:04.609 --> 04:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
please thank you so much for your time
 
04:39:06.769 --> 04:39:06.779 align:start position:0%
and attention and
 
04:39:08.390 --> 04:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
um I'll take any questions that you
 
04:39:10.010 --> 04:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
might have all right thank you very much
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
04:39:14.990 --> 04:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:16.551 --> 04:39:16.561 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was passed out
 
04:39:18.349 --> 04:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
it's got your name on it
 
04:39:20.810 --> 04:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
um is this document that refers to
 
04:39:24.670 --> 04:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
section 126x colon 3.
 
04:39:28.010 --> 04:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
where did this come from
 
04:39:36.289 --> 04:39:36.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
this this is uh this is the RSA 126. yes
 
04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay that is I'm so sorry I just pulled
 
04:39:44.330 --> 04:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
out that one section I thought I put one
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
I thought I put and I don't have that
 
04:39:49.490 --> 04:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
one with me right now
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:53.448 --> 04:39:53.458 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:39:53.458 --> 04:39:55.310 align:start position:0%
other questions
yes

04:39:55.310 --> 04:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:39:56.750 --> 04:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:39:58.130 --> 04:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering are there any
 
04:39:59.390 --> 04:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
other prescription drugs or
 
04:40:01.368 --> 04:40:01.378 align:start position:0%
non-prescription drugs with these sort
 
04:40:05.890 --> 04:40:05.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:08.930 --> 04:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know what drugs specifically
 
04:40:11.090 --> 04:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
have Protections in the state law but
 
04:40:13.070 --> 04:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
what I do know is that when you have a
 
04:40:15.410 --> 04:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
urine drug screen and it's a marketed
 
04:40:18.410 --> 04:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
drug that's prescribed to people that
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
depending on again depending on whether
 
04:40:23.448 --> 04:40:23.458 align:start position:0%
you're operating heavy equipment or
 
04:40:26.330 --> 04:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
whether you're in a job where all of the
 
04:40:29.570 --> 04:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
other things and the snippet of Statute
 
04:40:32.330 --> 04:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
that I sent around the room
 
04:40:35.810 --> 04:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
so all of these things are the same if
 
04:40:39.170 --> 04:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
you were to take Oxycontin or oxycodone
 
04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
but those are medically prescribed
 
04:40:41.920 --> 04:40:42.288 align:start position:0%
but those are medically prescribed
[Music]

04:40:42.288 --> 04:40:42.298 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:40:42.298 --> 04:40:45.230 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:46.970 --> 04:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to call them pills
 
04:40:49.250 --> 04:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
they're just they're they're
 
04:40:51.530 --> 04:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
and so what winds up happening is that
 
04:40:53.330 --> 04:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
they say do you have a prescription for
 
04:40:56.390 --> 04:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
this the lab calls you you go back and
 
04:40:58.850 --> 04:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
forth with the lab you don't disclose
 
04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
anything to the employer you disclose it
 
04:41:03.948 --> 04:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
to the lab and you say oh yes I have a
 
04:41:05.810 --> 04:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
prescription for that they will tell you
 
04:41:07.730 --> 04:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
what kind of proof they need for you to
 
04:41:08.690 --> 04:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
send in
 
04:41:10.788 --> 04:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
04:41:13.730 --> 04:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
do what they call clearing you for
 
04:41:13.740 --> 04:41:16.850 align:start position:0%
do what they call clearing you for
employment

04:41:16.850 --> 04:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:16.860 --> 04:41:18.350 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:41:18.350 --> 04:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:41:20.690 --> 04:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm not very familiar with the
 
04:41:22.970 --> 04:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
pers the Cannabis program uh I got I got
 
04:41:24.530 --> 04:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
to hear but is there actually a
 
04:41:27.530 --> 04:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
prescription for it or how does that
 
04:41:30.890 --> 04:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
work so like if a lab asks you know do
 
04:41:33.410 --> 04:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
you have a prescription for cannabis do
 
04:41:34.970 --> 04:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
you provide like do you provide them
 
04:41:36.650 --> 04:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
that and I know you said that they still
 
04:41:38.270 --> 04:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
had to show it to the employer but I
 
04:41:43.850 --> 04:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:43.860 --> 04:41:46.368 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:41:46.368 --> 04:41:46.378 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:41:50.090 --> 04:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
if if this is beyond you I there might
 
04:41:52.010 --> 04:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
be somebody coming up next that can
 
04:41:54.110 --> 04:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
answer it better whatever you're
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable with but
 
04:41:57.948 --> 04:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:41:59.150 --> 04:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'm hearing that someone
 
04:42:01.310 --> 04:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
else wants to answer that
 
04:42:02.930 --> 04:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
um thank you if you don't mind waiting
 
04:42:05.150 --> 04:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
until the next person does I have an
 
04:42:06.830 --> 04:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
answer but it's probably not as good as
 
04:42:06.840 --> 04:42:10.490 align:start position:0%
answer but it's probably not as good as
Jerry's

04:42:10.490 --> 04:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:14.090 --> 04:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else have questions
 
04:42:16.310 --> 04:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for introducing
 
04:42:17.208 --> 04:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:42:19.010 --> 04:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for taking the time to
 
04:42:20.448 --> 04:42:20.458 align:start position:0%
hear my bill
 
04:42:23.330 --> 04:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
and as we've all been mumbling next up
 
04:42:26.750 --> 04:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
we'll ask the honorable Jerry knurk uh
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
back with us he is on the therapeutic
 
04:42:33.230 --> 04:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board
 
04:42:35.930 --> 04:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
and he has provided some written
 
04:42:38.090 --> 04:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
testimony and asked to speak for three
 
04:42:41.948 --> 04:42:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:45.288 --> 04:42:45.298 align:start position:0%
more of an overview of the therapeutic
 
04:42:49.490 --> 04:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:51.530 --> 04:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
what I was doing Wendy obviously has
 
04:42:53.690 --> 04:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
first dibs because she's just she still
 
04:42:56.208 --> 04:42:56.218 align:start position:0%
is a rep and I'm not but we're both
 
04:42:58.190 --> 04:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
trying to ping pong between this and a
 
04:43:00.350 --> 04:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee downstairs
 
04:43:03.530 --> 04:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
yes so um as the chair has said
 
04:43:06.170 --> 04:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
um I served as a state rep and I still
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
serve as a chair of the therapeutic
 
04:43:09.350 --> 04:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board so I
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
can give some input into this I also am
 
04:43:13.970 --> 04:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
a retired orthopedic surgeon
 
04:43:16.368 --> 04:43:16.378 align:start position:0%
um so the issue is that in its November
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
22 meeting the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board uh I should
 
04:43:24.288 --> 04:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
explain what that is that's a group of
 
04:43:26.030 --> 04:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
about 10 providers along with a patient
 
04:43:27.890 --> 04:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative who is also here to
 
04:43:29.930 --> 04:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
testify and
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
a representative from the atcs the
 
04:43:34.868 --> 04:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
dispensaries we worked together to
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
provide oversight in the medical aspects
 
04:43:39.890 --> 04:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
of the therapeutic cannabis program and
 
04:43:41.810 --> 04:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
in the November 22 meeting we considered
 
04:43:43.610 --> 04:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
this bill and we voted unanimously in
 
04:43:45.110 --> 04:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
favor of the concept we didn't worry
 
04:43:46.730 --> 04:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
about parsing out all the language
 
04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
because we're not Labor uh in Monks we
 
04:43:51.410 --> 04:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
don't know that stuff as well
 
04:43:53.570 --> 04:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
point is cannabis has been demonstrated
 
04:43:55.550 --> 04:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
to be of oh by the way I did distribute
 
04:43:57.708 --> 04:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
the written testimony you all have it I
 
04:43:59.150 --> 04:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
did it before
 
04:44:00.948 --> 04:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
um therapy value in a number of
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
conditions such as pain PTSD and others
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
now to enroll in the program you have to
 
04:44:09.770 --> 04:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
be certified by your medical provider
 
04:44:11.570 --> 04:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
that you have one of the qualifying
 
04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
conditions that exist in law
 
04:44:16.550 --> 04:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
so you're certified for it
 
04:44:19.310 --> 04:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
the prescriber does not prescribe
 
04:44:21.050 --> 04:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
cannabis we cannot do that because it's
 
04:44:23.208 --> 04:44:23.218 align:start position:0%
a schedule one drug schedule one drugs
 
04:44:26.090 --> 04:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
are drugs which ostensibly have high
 
04:44:27.650 --> 04:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
abuse for potential and have no
 
04:44:29.150 --> 04:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
therapeutic benefit of course that's
 
04:44:30.530 --> 04:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
actually kind of nonsense because we
 
04:44:32.208 --> 04:44:32.218 align:start position:0%
have cannabis derived drugs that are
 
04:44:34.910 --> 04:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
approved by the FDA so it's the DEA
 
04:44:36.288 --> 04:44:36.298 align:start position:0%
needs to get their act together but they
 
04:44:38.270 --> 04:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
haven't done that for a long time
 
04:44:39.890 --> 04:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
so they certify that you have a
 
04:44:41.208 --> 04:44:41.218 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition
 
04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
and then once you're approved by the
 
04:44:44.448 --> 04:44:44.458 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program you're
 
04:44:46.910 --> 04:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
given a registry ID card
 
04:44:49.250 --> 04:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
that enables you to enter the
 
04:44:51.770 --> 04:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center or ATC
 
04:44:53.990 --> 04:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
those are the dispensaries where you'll
 
04:44:56.448 --> 04:44:56.458 align:start position:0%
receive counseling about the appropriate
 
04:44:57.890 --> 04:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
strains and about the roots of
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
administration that might work best for
 
04:45:01.128 --> 04:45:01.138 align:start position:0%
you and that's where you obtain the
 
04:45:03.230 --> 04:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
provides valuable educational and
 
04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
therapeutic benefits to over 13 000
 
04:45:10.910 --> 04:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
patients in New Hampshire and the
 
04:45:12.590 --> 04:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
majority of the patients to qualified
 
04:45:15.830 --> 04:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
are patients between ages 50 and 70. the
 
04:45:17.690 --> 04:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
vast majority are in the working age
 
04:45:17.700 --> 04:45:18.830 align:start position:0%
vast majority are in the working age
group

04:45:18.830 --> 04:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
group
 
04:45:20.990 --> 04:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
about 82 percent of patients have
 
04:45:22.730 --> 04:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
reported that they are able to reduce
 
04:45:24.890 --> 04:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
their prescription drug use
 
04:45:27.050 --> 04:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
over 70 percent of the patients are
 
04:45:29.030 --> 04:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
certified for treating pain
 
04:45:30.948 --> 04:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
and that often allows them to either
 
04:45:32.930 --> 04:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
lessen or actually avoid the use of
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
opioids and I followed up I was not able
 
04:45:38.150 --> 04:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
to to certify back when I was still in
 
04:45:40.368 --> 04:45:40.378 align:start position:0%
practice because the law wasn't in yet
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
but I followed up with some of my
 
04:45:43.970 --> 04:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
patients and some of them who I could
 
04:45:46.610 --> 04:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
never get off opioids because I did back
 
04:45:48.530 --> 04:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
pain stuff so
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
um we're able to get off opioids using
 
04:45:52.250 --> 04:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
just an occasional dose of cannabis and
 
04:45:54.170 --> 04:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
they were free of them
 
04:45:55.610 --> 04:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
so it's important to understand though
 
04:45:57.770 --> 04:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
that patients who use therapeutic
 
04:46:00.050 --> 04:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
cannabis they use it to treat a disorder
 
04:46:03.010 --> 04:46:03.020 align:start position:0%
they do not use it to get intoxicated
 
04:46:05.948 --> 04:46:05.958 align:start position:0%
intoxication is not the intended effect
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
it is a negative side effect
 
04:46:11.570 --> 04:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
the strategy that we use the patients is
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
to start low and go slow so we start at
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
a very low dose and we titrate that dose
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
upward until the person reaches their
 
04:46:20.208 --> 04:46:20.218 align:start position:0%
therapeutic benefit without any toxic
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
side effects if they do then they may
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
have to try to change to a different
 
04:46:24.770 --> 04:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
strain or something like that because
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
again we're working for function we
 
04:46:28.550 --> 04:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
relieve the pain so the person can
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
function if you make them intoxicated
 
04:46:32.030 --> 04:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
they're not functional you've not done
 
04:46:33.470 --> 04:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
your job so we're trying to find that
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
happy medium of the appropriate dose and
 
04:46:38.810 --> 04:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
you know you'd be amazed to find out
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
there are a handful of are well our
 
04:46:42.288 --> 04:46:42.298 align:start position:0%
fellow I guess I can't say that anymore
 
04:46:44.570 --> 04:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
your fellow Representatives who are
 
04:46:46.070 --> 04:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
members who are patients in the
 
04:46:47.690 --> 04:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program happily
 
04:46:50.750 --> 04:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
serving and doing a good job
 
04:46:53.208 --> 04:46:53.218 align:start position:0%
so there are two ways that therapeutic
 
04:46:54.890 --> 04:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients actually face
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
discrimination in comparison to patients
 
04:46:58.850 --> 04:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
with other prescription medications the
 
04:47:01.090 --> 04:47:01.100 align:start position:0%
first one has to do with unique
 
04:47:03.650 --> 04:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
pharmacokinetics of THC
 
04:47:06.350 --> 04:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
THC is a psychoactive component in
 
04:47:08.690 --> 04:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
cannabis and therapeutic cannabis will
 
04:47:10.850 --> 04:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
contain differing amounts of THC some
 
04:47:12.830 --> 04:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
will be high in THC some will be low in
 
04:47:15.708 --> 04:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
THC but the point is that when you take
 
04:47:19.730 --> 04:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
THC it is fat soluble it binds to the
 
04:47:22.128 --> 04:47:22.138 align:start position:0%
fat in your body and then it is very
 
04:47:24.830 --> 04:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
slowly released and then excreted in the
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
urine and the issue is that you may
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
still test positive for THC even if you
 
04:47:32.448 --> 04:47:32.458 align:start position:0%
haven't taken any cannabis for a week or
 
04:47:34.610 --> 04:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
even more if you're using a fairly high
 
04:47:34.620 --> 04:47:35.990 align:start position:0%
even more if you're using a fairly high
dose

04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
dose
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
so the issue is that the mere presence
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
of THC does not denote impairment
 
04:47:44.510 --> 04:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
and uh this is very different that we
 
04:47:46.368 --> 04:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
see in opioids opioids are not fat
 
04:47:47.868 --> 04:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
soluble they're basically in the
 
04:47:50.448 --> 04:47:50.458 align:start position:0%
intravenous and intracellular space and
 
04:47:52.070 --> 04:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
when you find an opioid under routine
 
04:47:55.250 --> 04:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
testing that indicates recent dosing if
 
04:47:57.288 --> 04:47:57.298 align:start position:0%
you find therapeutic cannabis it could
 
04:47:59.208 --> 04:47:59.218 align:start position:0%
have been a week ago so think about the
 
04:48:01.070 --> 04:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
person who took a some therapeutic
 
04:48:02.930 --> 04:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
cannabis the night before to treat their
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
PTSD or their pain problems they get a
 
04:48:06.530 --> 04:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
decent night's sleep they come to work
 
04:48:08.690 --> 04:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
the next day they've still got THC in
 
04:48:10.070 --> 04:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
their urine if they took an opioid it
 
04:48:12.288 --> 04:48:12.298 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be there so that's one way that
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit difficult the second
 
04:48:16.128 --> 04:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
though is what uh representative Thomas
 
04:48:17.690 --> 04:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Vale was just
 
04:48:19.128 --> 04:48:19.138 align:start position:0%
speaking about
 
04:48:20.810 --> 04:48:20.820 align:start position:0%
um they are discriminated against in
 
04:48:22.910 --> 04:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
terms of how the case is handled when it
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
comes back with a positive test for THC
 
04:48:28.128 --> 04:48:28.138 align:start position:0%
so consider that hypothetical of a
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
patient taking opioids for pain
 
04:48:33.410 --> 04:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
and the versus taking therapeutic
 
04:48:33.420 --> 04:48:34.670 align:start position:0%
and the versus taking therapeutic
cannabis

04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
the DOT drug testing employee notice
 
04:48:38.690 --> 04:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
states that if you test positive and
 
04:48:40.490 --> 04:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
opioid but you present a valid
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
prescription the medical review officer
 
04:48:43.850 --> 04:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
will report the result of your test to
 
04:48:45.890 --> 04:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
your employer as negative
 
04:48:48.350 --> 04:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
that person's disability will be
 
04:48:50.570 --> 04:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
accommodated but no such protection
 
04:48:52.550 --> 04:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
exists for the patient using therapeutic
 
04:48:54.350 --> 04:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis because back to your question
 
04:48:57.050 --> 04:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
there is no prescription that's why this
 
04:48:59.208 --> 04:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
bill refers to the certification card
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
not a prescription
 
04:49:02.868 --> 04:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
now the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
04:49:05.628 --> 04:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
already addressed this issue in 2022
 
04:49:08.750 --> 04:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
with their unanimous decision and the
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
pain Scott Payne versus right-of-way
 
04:49:12.830 --> 04:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
Incorporated case Payne was using
 
04:49:14.510 --> 04:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic interesting name actually
 
04:49:16.970 --> 04:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
but he was Payne was using therapeutic
 
04:49:19.850 --> 04:49:19.860 align:start position:0%
cannabis for PTSD and he requested
 
04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
exemption for routine drug testing is a
 
04:49:23.330 --> 04:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation of his
 
04:49:27.948 --> 04:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court stated that RSA quote
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
RSA chapter 354-a does not contain any
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
language categorically excluding the use
 
04:49:39.530 --> 04:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
of therapeutic cannabis as an
 
04:49:42.350 --> 04:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
accommodation end quote
 
04:49:44.208 --> 04:49:44.218 align:start position:0%
therefore their employer by the way
 
04:49:46.490 --> 04:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
while we're at it the 126x that is the
 
04:49:48.288 --> 04:49:48.298 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis statute that's what
 
04:49:49.730 --> 04:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
established the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:49:51.708 --> 04:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
program so that's what that is when it
 
04:49:53.690 --> 04:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
got distributed
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
um so therefore the employer uh the
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said the employer might
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
have to consider therapeutic cannabis as
 
04:50:01.128 --> 04:50:01.138 align:start position:0%
a reasonable accommodation
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled in
 
04:50:04.010 --> 04:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
support of equal treatment for
 
04:50:06.110 --> 04:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients this
 
04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't preclude the need for this bill
 
04:50:09.410 --> 04:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
because we need to put this protection
 
04:50:11.628 --> 04:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
into statute so that thousands of
 
04:50:13.250 --> 04:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients don't have
 
04:50:15.288 --> 04:50:15.298 align:start position:0%
to go through litigation to have their
 
04:50:17.090 --> 04:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
disability protected
 
04:50:18.708 --> 04:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
I do have a recommendation regarding
 
04:50:20.330 --> 04:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
what I see is one flaw in this bill and
 
04:50:22.190 --> 04:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
in this sense I'm not speaking for tcmob
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
because we did not parse out the
 
04:50:25.310 --> 04:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
language since we are not diverse in
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
labor law but um this is my view lines
 
04:50:32.448 --> 04:50:32.458 align:start position:0%
seven and eight of the bill
 
04:50:34.250 --> 04:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
they State this section shall not apply
 
04:50:35.868 --> 04:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
to employment where drug screening tests
 
04:50:37.610 --> 04:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
are required for the safety of persons
 
04:50:39.948 --> 04:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
and property at the job site
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
that is a loophole so big you can drive
 
04:50:43.788 --> 04:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
a truck right through it
 
04:50:46.250 --> 04:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
and that's a problem because any any
 
04:50:49.310 --> 04:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
employer could just say you know uh it's
 
04:50:50.810 --> 04:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
important in my business I don't want
 
04:50:52.610 --> 04:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
you to do that and they're completely
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
undercut the goal of this bill
 
04:50:57.470 --> 04:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
so I would recommend amending this to
 
04:50:59.930 --> 04:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
keep it compliant with federal law and
 
04:51:01.550 --> 04:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
federal rule
 
04:51:03.890 --> 04:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
but remove that option of any random
 
04:51:05.570 --> 04:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
employer exempting themselves by the
 
04:51:07.128 --> 04:51:07.138 align:start position:0%
language I've put in which would be to
 
04:51:08.628 --> 04:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
strike the part that says required for
 
04:51:10.128 --> 04:51:10.138 align:start position:0%
safety or persons and property the job
 
04:51:13.010 --> 04:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
job site and have it say shall not apply
 
04:51:14.628 --> 04:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
to employment or drug screening tests
 
04:51:18.310 --> 04:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
are required by federal rule or law
 
04:51:20.390 --> 04:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
therefore you're still covered by the
 
04:51:22.190 --> 04:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Transportation Act which says
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
that pilots and anybody in the
 
04:51:26.708 --> 04:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
transportation sector have to be tested
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement all that kind of stuff
 
04:51:31.128 --> 04:51:31.138 align:start position:0%
plus also as I understand there was a
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
rule that was made that said that
 
04:51:35.930 --> 04:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
federal employees could not use cannabis
 
04:51:38.270 --> 04:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
or any other kind of drugs so this would
 
04:51:42.350 --> 04:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
make us not so keep us compliant with
 
04:51:44.690 --> 04:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
federal law which is important obviously
 
04:51:47.390 --> 04:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
but it would be I was thinking of making
 
04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
a laundry list but I didn't want to make
 
04:51:50.030 --> 04:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
a laundry list because as we know then
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
you exclude certain things that you
 
04:51:52.850 --> 04:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
should have put in or whatever the
 
04:51:54.830 --> 04:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
government's already done that for us we
 
04:51:56.690 --> 04:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
can just uh the federal government we
 
04:51:59.090 --> 04:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
can just defer to them and I kept it
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
vague and didn't refer to the Omnibus
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation bill because that might
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
get changed this way we don't have to
 
04:52:04.910 --> 04:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
change the statute every time the
 
04:52:07.430 --> 04:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
federal stuff changes so in summary if a
 
04:52:09.230 --> 04:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
patient is found to have THC in a drug
 
04:52:11.208 --> 04:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
test and they have a current valid
 
04:52:13.368 --> 04:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program registry ID
 
04:52:13.378 --> 04:52:14.330 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program registry ID
card

04:52:14.330 --> 04:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
card
 
04:52:16.550 --> 04:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
then that drug test should be treated
 
04:52:18.590 --> 04:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
just the same is that they were found to
 
04:52:20.570 --> 04:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
have an opioid in their drug test and
 
04:52:22.190 --> 04:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
they have a valid prescription that's
 
04:52:23.990 --> 04:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
all that's being asked by this bill
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
again with the usual exceptions to be
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
compliant with federal law
 
04:52:32.448 --> 04:52:32.458 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions thank you for
 
04:52:34.610 --> 04:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
your testimony I do have a question
 
04:52:36.910 --> 04:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for
 
04:52:39.050 --> 04:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
making the suggestion about the federal
 
04:52:42.050 --> 04:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
law are you aware is there any place
 
04:52:44.930 --> 04:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
remaining in state law that as a state
 
04:52:47.330 --> 04:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
we require testing for certain
 
04:52:50.570 --> 04:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
professions that I do not know
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
um because I think and I think that the
 
04:52:54.288 --> 04:52:54.298 align:start position:0%
sergeant and I were speaking about this
 
04:52:57.530 --> 04:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
earlier I think that they for the uh for
 
04:52:59.150 --> 04:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
law enforcement I think that has covered
 
04:53:01.128 --> 04:53:01.138 align:start position:0%
federally anyway so we're all set on
 
04:53:02.570 --> 04:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
that one
 
04:53:04.910 --> 04:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
um obviously if in the testimony if we
 
04:53:06.650 --> 04:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
find out that there is a state issue
 
04:53:08.330 --> 04:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
then we might have to put in some other
 
04:53:09.948 --> 04:53:09.958 align:start position:0%
exceptions but I think this would
 
04:53:12.050 --> 04:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
probably cover it though I'm no expert
 
04:53:13.810 --> 04:53:13.820 align:start position:0%
in labor law
 
04:53:18.410 --> 04:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Lowe
 
04:53:19.850 --> 04:53:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:53:20.930 --> 04:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
um when you made the uh the statement
 
04:53:24.830 --> 04:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
about line seven here uh line seven and
 
04:53:24.840 --> 04:53:25.730 align:start position:0%
about line seven here uh line seven and
eight

04:53:25.730 --> 04:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
eight
 
04:53:28.010 --> 04:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
um I've been involved in dangerous
 
04:53:30.770 --> 04:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
employment and uh how would you
 
04:53:33.410 --> 04:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
differentiate between someone who is
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
using record uh can't uh
 
04:53:39.230 --> 04:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
not recreational uh therapeutic cannabis
 
04:53:42.288 --> 04:53:42.298 align:start position:0%
and maybe recreationally too
 
04:53:44.810 --> 04:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
um you know that I I see a problem there
 
04:53:46.368 --> 04:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
like I said I've been involved in
 
04:53:48.410 --> 04:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
dangerous employment and I don't want
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's you know Stone putting up
 
04:53:51.410 --> 04:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
staging on the side of a house for me
 
04:53:53.570 --> 04:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
and I go up and it falls down yeah
 
04:53:55.070 --> 04:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things about that
 
04:53:56.448 --> 04:53:56.458 align:start position:0%
number one is
 
04:53:56.458 --> 04:53:57.590 align:start position:0%
number one is
um

04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:00.770 --> 04:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
you know it's the the issue would be
 
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
that we would hope that you would pick
 
04:54:05.448 --> 04:54:05.458 align:start position:0%
it up refresh it back up there's nothing
 
04:54:06.590 --> 04:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:54:09.288 --> 04:54:09.298 align:start position:0%
um in the 126x it is stated that there
 
04:54:11.030 --> 04:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
is nothing that it would uh allow
 
04:54:12.650 --> 04:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
nothing in that statute that would allow
 
04:54:15.410 --> 04:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
a person to actually be uh intoxicated
 
04:54:18.350 --> 04:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
during the time of their employment and
 
04:54:20.390 --> 04:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
in the labor law stuff that I was
 
04:54:23.090 --> 04:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
reading in in D.O.T or when the from
 
04:54:25.550 --> 04:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
when the labor law law firms they were
 
04:54:27.288 --> 04:54:27.298 align:start position:0%
saying you know if you see the person
 
04:54:31.010 --> 04:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
they reek of cannabis uh their bloodshot
 
04:54:32.750 --> 04:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
eyes they're not they're slurring their
 
04:54:32.760 --> 04:54:33.590 align:start position:0%
eyes they're not they're slurring their
speech

04:54:33.590 --> 04:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
speech
 
04:54:35.448 --> 04:54:35.458 align:start position:0%
that's a different issue then they're
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
impaired we're not just talking about a
 
04:54:38.810 --> 04:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
positive urine test and then you'd have
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
to handle that differently and that
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
would be a separate case
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
um in the bill
 
04:54:46.970 --> 04:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
It also says that in eight lines eight
 
04:54:48.890 --> 04:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
and nine and ten nothing in this section
 
04:54:50.270 --> 04:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
should be construed to require an
 
04:54:52.850 --> 04:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
employer to allow being impaired by
 
04:54:55.010 --> 04:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
cannabis products but it's the same
 
04:54:56.628 --> 04:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
thing for recreational let's say you are
 
04:54:58.310 --> 04:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
a recreational user and you used it a
 
04:54:59.810 --> 04:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
week ago and haven't touched it since
 
04:55:02.208 --> 04:55:02.218 align:start position:0%
that time your drug test could come back
 
04:55:04.010 --> 04:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
positive and you're perfectly normal
 
04:55:05.628 --> 04:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
this is the big problem in law
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement for driving impairment
 
04:55:09.890 --> 04:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
testing is that we do not the the urine
 
04:55:11.810 --> 04:55:11.820 align:start position:0%
tests and blood tests are not great in
 
04:55:13.850 --> 04:55:13.860 align:start position:0%
terms of they don't measure impairment
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
they just measure the drug
 
04:55:17.628 --> 04:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
but basically it lines eight nine and
 
04:55:19.010 --> 04:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
ten already say that you can't we're
 
04:55:19.020 --> 04:55:22.850 align:start position:0%
ten already say that you can't we're
compared

04:55:22.850 --> 04:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:22.860 --> 04:55:25.730 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:55:25.730 --> 04:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:28.430 --> 04:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
I guess my question would be is is there
 
04:55:30.770 --> 04:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
any test or any tests in the pipeline
 
04:55:33.530 --> 04:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
okay that uh that would differentiate
 
04:55:35.628 --> 04:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
between the guy that smoked a bone
 
04:55:38.390 --> 04:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
before work or at lunchtime okay and
 
04:55:40.010 --> 04:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
Andy's got this card sitting in his
 
04:55:42.410 --> 04:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
pocket okay um you know is there
 
04:55:44.810 --> 04:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
anything that'll differentiate no there
 
04:55:47.330 --> 04:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
are no markers in therapeutic cannabis
 
04:55:50.330 --> 04:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
um it is oftentimes highly refined and
 
04:55:53.868 --> 04:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
maybe uh extracts and tinctures that are
 
04:55:56.208 --> 04:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
that have been developed but that they
 
04:55:57.948 --> 04:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
still would still what's being tested
 
04:56:00.890 --> 04:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
for is a metabolite of THC and depending
 
04:56:02.810 --> 04:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
on the dose or the level of THC that
 
04:56:03.890 --> 04:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
would be there one this is one of the
 
04:56:06.530 --> 04:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
issues with uh the hemp stuff that we
 
04:56:08.090 --> 04:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
went through just a few years ago the
 
04:56:09.708 --> 04:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
federal hemp law says it can't be more
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
than 0.3 percent THC to be legal for for
 
04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
him but you have to be very cautious
 
04:56:18.410 --> 04:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
because if you're just using CBD oil I
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
might have a little bit of hemp in it a
 
04:56:21.770 --> 04:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
little bit THC I'm sorry and you could
 
04:56:24.650 --> 04:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
flunk a drug test so uh but there's no
 
04:56:26.150 --> 04:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
way to discriminate that there's no
 
04:56:28.670 --> 04:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
marker in the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:56:30.050 --> 04:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
but by the way that would be the same
 
04:56:31.128 --> 04:56:31.138 align:start position:0%
thing as a person who might have a
 
04:56:33.350 --> 04:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
prescription for an opioid but they just
 
04:56:34.910 --> 04:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
happen to also be buying street drugs
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
and taking that on the job and being
 
04:56:38.270 --> 04:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
impaired it's really no difference
 
04:56:42.050 --> 04:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:42.060 --> 04:56:44.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:56:44.750 --> 04:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:56:46.850 --> 04:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh good to see you
 
04:56:49.730 --> 04:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
again thank you
 
04:56:49.740 --> 04:56:51.650 align:start position:0%
again thank you
um

04:56:51.650 --> 04:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:53.390 --> 04:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
we're gonna dovetail off of what
 
04:56:55.310 --> 04:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative love said nothing uh
 
04:56:57.770 --> 04:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
sections a number to excuse me sentences
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
8 9 and 10. nothing in this section
 
04:57:01.910 --> 04:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
shall be construed to require an
 
04:57:03.948 --> 04:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
employer to allow being impaired by
 
04:57:06.830 --> 04:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis products while at work
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
um during a testimony you said that it
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
was difficult to
 
04:57:12.670 --> 04:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
um determine a level of impairment
 
04:57:15.288 --> 04:57:15.298 align:start position:0%
police officers and whatnot so now we're
 
04:57:17.690 --> 04:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
leaving it to an employer to decide
 
04:57:19.730 --> 04:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
whether they're impaired or not and if
 
04:57:21.288 --> 04:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
the employer decides to dismiss them for
 
04:57:22.610 --> 04:57:22.620 align:start position:0%
the day or dismiss them from the job
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
because they seem to be impaired this
 
04:57:26.208 --> 04:57:26.218 align:start position:0%
would give them the ability to go to
 
04:57:28.250 --> 04:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
Labor Commission and say I wasn't
 
04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
impaired that day there'd be no test for
 
04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
it yeah they know that would be another
 
04:57:35.208 --> 04:57:35.218 align:start position:0%
set of that would be a whole separate
 
04:57:36.830 --> 04:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
type of case and I'm not quite sure how
 
04:57:38.570 --> 04:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
to resolve that
 
04:57:42.590 --> 04:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
um I there are some very highly
 
04:57:44.868 --> 04:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
sensitive jobs that use some types of
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
cotton neurocognitive testing that look
 
04:57:49.788 --> 04:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
at reflexes and in your cognition to be
 
04:57:51.350 --> 04:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
able to test a person for impairment
 
04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
from any Source
 
04:57:56.208 --> 04:57:56.218 align:start position:0%
um and uh but we do not have that
 
04:57:58.850 --> 04:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
routinely available to test impairment I
 
04:58:00.530 --> 04:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
mean because you give them a you know a
 
04:58:02.930 --> 04:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
field sobriety test see if they passed
 
04:58:04.730 --> 04:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
that but you'd have to Doc the employer
 
04:58:07.010 --> 04:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
would need to document that
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
um but I mean again it's the same thing
 
04:58:10.670 --> 04:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
for an opioid
 
04:58:13.430 --> 04:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
or an alcohol I mean if you're doing if
 
04:58:17.208 --> 04:58:17.218 align:start position:0%
they're at work and they are uh
 
04:58:18.770 --> 04:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
the drunk
 
04:58:20.270 --> 04:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
what would you do then
 
04:58:23.810 --> 04:58:23.820 align:start position:0%
you know huh but there's Marcus for that
 
04:58:25.610 --> 04:58:25.620 align:start position:0%
say what there's Marcus for that you
 
04:58:28.610 --> 04:58:28.620 align:start position:0%
would smell it yes but outward things
 
04:58:32.810 --> 04:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
but if there was a base follow-up yes
 
04:58:35.030 --> 04:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
if there's a baseline of
 
04:58:36.948 --> 04:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
intoxication because of medical
 
04:58:39.050 --> 04:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
marijuana and they're at work you're
 
04:58:40.430 --> 04:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
leaving it to the employer to say well
 
04:58:42.770 --> 04:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
you're imperative you're not impaired I
 
04:58:44.208 --> 04:58:44.218 align:start position:0%
mean and then by the time it gets to
 
04:58:45.288 --> 04:58:45.298 align:start position:0%
labor department it's weeks later
 
04:58:46.490 --> 04:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's going to be no testing there's
 
04:58:47.868 --> 04:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
going to be it's going to be he said she
 
04:58:49.610 --> 04:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
said and then it's going to be well that
 
04:58:50.750 --> 04:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
would be the case from what you've just
 
04:58:52.368 --> 04:58:52.378 align:start position:0%
laid out with the
 
04:58:54.288 --> 04:58:54.298 align:start position:0%
with alcohol you say you smelled it on
 
04:58:55.730 --> 04:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
his breath but you don't have a test you
 
04:58:56.570 --> 04:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
haven't proven that you didn't do
 
04:58:59.690 --> 04:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
breathalyzer test so unless you do a
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
breathalyzer test which I think most
 
04:59:02.810 --> 04:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
employees aren't going to do employers
 
04:59:04.910 --> 04:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
aren't going to do so as a result
 
04:59:06.170 --> 04:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
um it's still going to be he said she
 
04:59:08.090 --> 04:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
said situation and so I think that would
 
04:59:10.010 --> 04:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
be a it might be an indication law on
 
04:59:12.050 --> 04:59:12.060 align:start position:0%
that one right but you
 
04:59:12.060 --> 04:59:13.270 align:start position:0%
that one right but you
oh

04:59:13.270 --> 04:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
they would still be um markers for a
 
04:59:19.850 --> 04:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
talk for alcohol intoxication work well
 
04:59:22.368 --> 04:59:22.378 align:start position:0%
if it were two days later there's no
 
04:59:24.110 --> 04:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
market for alcohol either in fact there
 
04:59:25.910 --> 04:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
would still be for THC perhaps but there
 
04:59:27.650 --> 04:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be for alcohol and so the THC
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
person again would be discriminated
 
04:59:29.868 --> 04:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
against even though at that point
 
04:59:31.788 --> 04:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
they're you know Stone Cold's over right
 
04:59:34.310 --> 04:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is this is the where I say
 
04:59:37.250 --> 04:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
it's the the physiology kind of makes it
 
04:59:39.170 --> 04:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
a little harder with THC that's just a
 
04:59:43.490 --> 04:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edge
 
04:59:47.448 --> 04:59:47.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
04:59:53.628 --> 04:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
person a used cannabis a week ago
 
04:59:58.128 --> 04:59:58.138 align:start position:0%
person B used cannabis 10 minutes ago
 
05:00:03.110 --> 05:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
can you explain what symptoms or markers
 
05:00:06.770 --> 05:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
may help distinguish a person who is
 
05:00:10.610 --> 05:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
very obviously intoxicated versus a
 
05:00:12.410 --> 05:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
person who would still register for a
 
05:00:14.570 --> 05:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
urine test
 
05:00:16.788 --> 05:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
um symptoms including like you said
 
05:00:21.288 --> 05:00:21.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:23.628 --> 05:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have it with me for that
 
05:00:25.750 --> 05:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
reference although I think there's no
 
05:00:28.128 --> 05:00:28.138 align:start position:0%
solid things but I think the things you
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
might use would be the same things that
 
05:00:31.610 --> 05:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
your local
 
05:00:34.190 --> 05:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
um police officer might use you know
 
05:00:37.550 --> 05:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
bloodshot eyes slurred speech difficulty
 
05:00:40.610 --> 05:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
with uh coordination
 
05:00:42.590 --> 05:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
um ordering a pizza while you're talking
 
05:00:45.110 --> 05:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
to them a few other things like that
 
05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
that might say this person is currently
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
intoxicated with cannabis but the thing
 
05:00:53.090 --> 05:00:53.100 align:start position:0%
is again the great majority of our
 
05:00:55.490 --> 05:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
patients they're using it they're not
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
trying to go for intoxication I mean one
 
05:00:59.628 --> 05:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
of the this is one of the stigma issues
 
05:01:01.070 --> 05:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
we see in therapeutic cannabis people
 
05:01:03.410 --> 05:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
think they're a whole bunch of stoners
 
05:01:06.050 --> 05:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
these are people again the primary age
 
05:01:08.990 --> 05:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
group age 50 to 70 and these are people
 
05:01:10.430 --> 05:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
that are highly functional people
 
05:01:12.170 --> 05:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
including many people in the legislature
 
05:01:15.410 --> 05:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
and uh they're they're not looking for
 
05:01:15.420 --> 05:01:16.810 align:start position:0%
and uh they're they're not looking for
intoxication

05:01:16.810 --> 05:01:16.820 align:start position:0%
intoxication
 
05:01:20.090 --> 05:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um my employer is
 
05:01:22.430 --> 05:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth health and if we have an
 
05:01:24.350 --> 05:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
employee that comes in and we suspect
 
05:01:25.910 --> 05:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
they are intoxicated we have a fitness
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
for Duty test
 
05:01:27.840 --> 05:01:28.490 align:start position:0%
for Duty test
um

05:01:28.490 --> 05:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:31.490 --> 05:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify that it is not
 
05:01:33.948 --> 05:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
impossible to discern whether or not
 
05:01:36.288 --> 05:01:36.298 align:start position:0%
somebody is intoxicated without your
 
05:01:38.990 --> 05:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
analysis correct I I think you can
 
05:01:40.490 --> 05:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
usually get a pretty good hunch as
 
05:01:42.590 --> 05:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative avalani pointed out you
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
know if there's a reek of alcohol and
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
and there are some signs that uh many of
 
05:01:49.610 --> 05:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
us might know from having seen somebody
 
05:01:51.708 --> 05:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
who's intoxicated with either alcohol or
 
05:01:54.410 --> 05:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
cannabis but I think it's again still a
 
05:01:56.690 --> 05:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
rather similar situation and in cannabis
 
05:01:59.448 --> 05:01:59.458 align:start position:0%
those kind of unfairly singled out even
 
05:02:01.128 --> 05:02:01.138 align:start position:0%
if or an opioid if it came in with an
 
05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
opioid and you're sitting there falling
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
asleep in the corner
 
05:02:05.270 --> 05:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
um you know you might be a little
 
05:02:07.430 --> 05:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
suspicious of course impairment can come
 
05:02:10.970 --> 05:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:13.610 --> 05:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative colcum
 
05:02:15.170 --> 05:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
05:02:19.010 --> 05:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
question I actually now I have two
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
um is there currently a a lawn place
 
05:02:24.170 --> 05:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
that prohibits an employer from refusing
 
05:02:26.330 --> 05:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
to hire somebody because they're on
 
05:02:30.170 --> 05:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:33.708 --> 05:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
I I'm not an expert in law I would a
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
labor law as my understanding though is
 
05:02:39.530 --> 05:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
that if for certain jobs such as if
 
05:02:41.810 --> 05:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
you're an airline pilot I'm not quite
 
05:02:43.610 --> 05:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
sure that you would be allowed if you
 
05:02:45.708 --> 05:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
had a positive test even if you had a
 
05:02:47.390 --> 05:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
prescription that part is above my pay
 
05:02:49.490 --> 05:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
grade I don't know
 
05:02:49.500 --> 05:02:51.170 align:start position:0%
grade I don't know
um

05:02:51.170 --> 05:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:54.650 --> 05:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
so I don't think you required now
 
05:02:56.050 --> 05:02:56.060 align:start position:0%
um when answering the previous question
 
05:02:58.670 --> 05:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh you you made a comment that there are
 
05:03:01.128 --> 05:03:01.138 align:start position:0%
many representatives that um are taking
 
05:03:02.868 --> 05:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
therapeutically well a few I should say
 
05:03:05.390 --> 05:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
not many but they do have statistics on
 
05:03:06.770 --> 05:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
how many representatives that you
 
05:03:09.288 --> 05:03:09.298 align:start position:0%
believe are taking therapeutic cannabis
 
05:03:11.150 --> 05:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I know of about
 
05:03:13.368 --> 05:03:13.378 align:start position:0%
four or five
 
05:03:15.410 --> 05:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
and representative veal just commented
 
05:03:18.410 --> 05:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
that she's out of 400. yeah
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
but I mean you can remember we have 13
 
05:03:23.330 --> 05:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
000 uh registered patients uh in the
 
05:03:25.970 --> 05:03:28.190 align:start position:0%
stage yeah
 
05:03:28.190 --> 05:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.090 --> 05:03:31.100 align:start position:0%
um other questions
 
05:03:33.230 --> 05:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
to that point
 
05:03:33.240 --> 05:03:34.070 align:start position:0%
to that point
um

05:03:34.070 --> 05:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:36.288 --> 05:03:36.298 align:start position:0%
honorable former representative
 
05:03:38.570 --> 05:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
of the current uh
 
05:03:41.330 --> 05:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
legislature how many of the 400 roughly
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
05:03:44.868 --> 05:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
um well current I don't know because
 
05:03:46.190 --> 05:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
some of these are people from a couple
 
05:03:47.390 --> 05:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
of years ago I'm not sure if they're
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
still serving but
 
05:03:49.680 --> 05:03:50.510 align:start position:0%
still serving but
um

05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:52.970 --> 05:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
I know I can count at least a few that
 
05:03:55.070 --> 05:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of and I would certainly never
 
05:03:56.750 --> 05:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
reveal the names their business to
 
05:03:58.910 --> 05:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
reveal the name
 
05:04:00.730 --> 05:04:00.740 align:start position:0%
any other questions over here
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
representative adjutant you have another
 
05:04:04.250 --> 05:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chairman uh
 
05:04:06.410 --> 05:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative or excuse me former
 
05:04:06.420 --> 05:04:07.970 align:start position:0%
representative or excuse me former
representative

05:04:07.970 --> 05:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:04:10.448 --> 05:04:10.458 align:start position:0%
um it takes a while I've had a hard time
 
05:04:13.310 --> 05:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
I had to change the h-o-n it was it was
 
05:04:15.890 --> 05:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
not easy uh the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:04:18.830 --> 05:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
program is within the RSA correct yes
 
05:04:21.770 --> 05:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
RSA 126x follow-up
 
05:04:24.530 --> 05:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh so just to refocus the conversation
 
05:04:26.390 --> 05:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
would it be correct to say that we are
 
05:04:29.810 --> 05:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
discussing the ability of individuals
 
05:04:33.890 --> 05:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
who are following a stank say State
 
05:04:33.900 --> 05:04:35.448 align:start position:0%
who are following a stank say State
sanctioned

05:04:35.448 --> 05:04:35.458 align:start position:0%
sanctioned
 
05:04:39.288 --> 05:04:39.298 align:start position:0%
cannabis health related program to
 
05:04:43.310 --> 05:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
engage in work provided that it is not a
 
05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
mechanical operation or safety risk is
 
05:04:48.650 --> 05:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
that we are simply allowing those people
 
05:04:50.930 --> 05:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
to work within the state sanctioned
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
program is that correct that's a very
 
05:04:55.610 --> 05:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
good wording thank you
 
05:04:57.590 --> 05:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:04:59.208 --> 05:04:59.218 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you everybody
 
05:05:01.128 --> 05:05:01.138 align:start position:0%
good to see you all again good to see
 
05:05:01.138 --> 05:05:03.288 align:start position:0%
good to see you all again good to see
you

05:05:03.288 --> 05:05:03.298 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:05:06.530 --> 05:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
um next up I would
 
05:05:09.650 --> 05:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas uh who is a
 
05:05:12.170 --> 05:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill uh obviously
 
05:05:14.868 --> 05:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
speaking to support for five minutes she
 
05:05:17.090 --> 05:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
asked me I probably won't even take five
 
05:05:17.100 --> 05:05:18.230 align:start position:0%
asked me I probably won't even take five
minutes

05:05:18.230 --> 05:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:05:21.050 --> 05:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
um it even though my name isn't on
 
05:05:23.868 --> 05:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
printed on the bill I I believe I am a
 
05:05:25.368 --> 05:05:25.378 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor however there was some
 
05:05:27.110 --> 05:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
confusion at OLS
 
05:05:29.930 --> 05:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
but I am on it okay excellent
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
um because I should be on it um this
 
05:05:34.250 --> 05:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that came up uh two terms
 
05:05:34.260 --> 05:05:35.628 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that came up uh two terms
ago

05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:05:37.970 --> 05:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
um and it was received actually pretty
 
05:05:37.980 --> 05:05:39.050 align:start position:0%
um and it was received actually pretty
well

05:05:39.050 --> 05:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:05:40.670 --> 05:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
um before I start I would like to just
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
make the point that New Hampshire does
 
05:05:46.070 --> 05:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
not have a medical marijuana program we
 
05:05:48.770 --> 05:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
have a therapeutic cannabis program
 
05:05:51.230 --> 05:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
and I keep hearing people
 
05:05:54.410 --> 05:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
um uh use the same at its medical
 
05:05:56.208 --> 05:05:56.218 align:start position:0%
marijuana is not in New Hampshire we
 
05:05:59.208 --> 05:05:59.218 align:start position:0%
have therapeutic cannabis okay so um my
 
05:06:00.590 --> 05:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
name is Wendy Thomas I'm a
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
representative for the town of Merrimack
 
05:06:05.810 --> 05:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
uh Hillsborough 12. I am a mother of six
 
05:06:07.850 --> 05:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
I am the executive director of a
 
05:06:09.530 --> 05:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
non-profit that advocates for the
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
disabled Community I work in the Energy
 
05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
Efficiency field I volunteer for our
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
local Historical Society
 
05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
I'm a State Rep
 
05:06:21.110 --> 05:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
and I am also a therapeutic cannabis
 
05:06:21.120 --> 05:06:22.430 align:start position:0%
and I am also a therapeutic cannabis
patient

05:06:22.430 --> 05:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
patient
 
05:06:24.830 --> 05:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
for the last five years that there has
 
05:06:28.010 --> 05:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
not been one day one day that I have not
 
05:06:29.690 --> 05:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
taken cannabis
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
it has controlled my pain and as a
 
05:06:35.390 --> 05:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
result I have not taken any opioids for
 
05:06:38.208 --> 05:06:38.218 align:start position:0%
chronic pain since starting the program
 
05:06:40.430 --> 05:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
and prior to starting the program I was
 
05:06:43.970 --> 05:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
on something called a pain contract and
 
05:06:47.448 --> 05:06:47.458 align:start position:0%
I was given 120 oxycodone tablets every
 
05:06:47.458 --> 05:06:48.948 align:start position:0%
I was given 120 oxycodone tablets every
month

05:06:48.948 --> 05:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
month
 
05:06:50.930 --> 05:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
however because I am a therapeutic
 
05:06:52.490 --> 05:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient there are some jobs
 
05:06:54.890 --> 05:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
that I cannot hold because I wouldn't be
 
05:06:56.930 --> 05:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
able to pass a drug test
 
05:06:59.510 --> 05:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
I could use prescription opioids and
 
05:07:02.150 --> 05:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
alcohol until the cows come home
 
05:07:03.890 --> 05:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't be able to take a micro
 
05:07:06.830 --> 05:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
dose which is what I take which is 5 to
 
05:07:08.208 --> 05:07:08.218 align:start position:0%
10 milligrams
 
05:07:10.190 --> 05:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
and the effect is about four to six
 
05:07:10.200 --> 05:07:11.208 align:start position:0%
and the effect is about four to six
hours

05:07:11.208 --> 05:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
hours
 
05:07:13.070 --> 05:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
and I take that at night to help me
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
sleep because I would test positive for
 
05:07:17.570 --> 05:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
cannabis for up to 13 days after I took
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
that dose
 
05:07:23.448 --> 05:07:23.458 align:start position:0%
I do not enjoy being high and I put that
 
05:07:25.070 --> 05:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
in quotations because the proper word is
 
05:07:25.080 --> 05:07:26.708 align:start position:0%
in quotations because the proper word is
inebriated

05:07:26.708 --> 05:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
inebriated
 
05:07:29.930 --> 05:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
but the microdoses that I take control
 
05:07:33.110 --> 05:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
my pain and it controls my inflammation
 
05:07:35.510 --> 05:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
now I'm not talking about someone who is
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
obviously inebriated at work that's
 
05:07:40.030 --> 05:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
actionable for any business to take
 
05:07:42.890 --> 05:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
actions against just like if somebody
 
05:07:44.750 --> 05:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
showed up drunk
 
05:07:46.788 --> 05:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program is a
 
05:07:49.368 --> 05:07:49.378 align:start position:0%
legal program and patients have some
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
legal protections we're allowed to
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
transport the Cannabis to our homes
 
05:07:55.128 --> 05:07:55.138 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to keep a certain amount
 
05:07:56.570 --> 05:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
in our homes
 
05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's also a self-regulating program
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
we know that if we abuse this privilege
 
05:08:05.448 --> 05:08:05.458 align:start position:0%
our cards can be revoked
 
05:08:07.868 --> 05:08:07.878 align:start position:0%
that's nothing that anybody wants to do
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
and just as an aside I used to work in
 
05:08:13.368 --> 05:08:13.378 align:start position:0%
one of the dispensaries and I never felt
 
05:08:16.010 --> 05:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
safer um in in the dispensaries because
 
05:08:18.470 --> 05:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
everybody knows they have to behave
 
05:08:20.448 --> 05:08:20.458 align:start position:0%
there's first of all a million cameras
 
05:08:22.910 --> 05:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
but everybody knows this is a privilege
 
05:08:26.090 --> 05:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
and it could be taken away
 
05:08:28.610 --> 05:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
so with this bill it's time to give more
 
05:08:30.350 --> 05:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
legal protections to this vulnerable
 
05:08:32.510 --> 05:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
population so that they can get on with
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
their lives and remain in the workforce
 
05:08:37.070 --> 05:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
and that's all we're asking
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
let us get on with our lives and stay
 
05:08:39.600 --> 05:08:40.670 align:start position:0%
let us get on with our lives and stay
working

05:08:40.670 --> 05:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
working
 
05:08:43.310 --> 05:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll take any questions thank
 
05:08:44.448 --> 05:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony are there
 
05:08:46.368 --> 05:08:46.378 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
05:08:48.770 --> 05:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh representing someone
 
05:08:50.570 --> 05:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:08:51.948 --> 05:08:51.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:08:54.650 --> 05:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
um you were very specific that we do not
 
05:08:56.690 --> 05:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
have a medical marijuana program but we
 
05:09:00.230 --> 05:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
do have a therapeutic cannabis program
 
05:09:01.788 --> 05:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
what's the difference
 
05:09:04.730 --> 05:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
wording wording there is there is some
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
discussion that the the term marijuana
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
is considered racist because it's
 
05:09:11.570 --> 05:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
actually the the Mexican term for the
 
05:09:13.970 --> 05:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
the drug and so by using marijuana
 
05:09:15.530 --> 05:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
you're you're enforcing that it's a
 
05:09:16.930 --> 05:09:16.940 align:start position:0%
brown people's drug
 
05:09:20.270 --> 05:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
but the wording in all of our rsas is
 
05:09:21.948 --> 05:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis we do not have a
 
05:09:24.590 --> 05:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana program thank you
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:31.070 --> 05:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
oh oh yes representative Granger to you
 
05:09:33.050 --> 05:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
oh that was your question all right are
 
05:09:34.550 --> 05:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
there any other questions
 
05:09:36.230 --> 05:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:09:38.330 --> 05:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to call next
 
05:09:40.490 --> 05:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Newell who is also a
 
05:09:51.650 --> 05:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:51.660 --> 05:09:53.090 align:start position:0%
 
hello

05:09:53.090 --> 05:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
hello
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
um thank you for allowing me to speak to
 
05:09:56.990 --> 05:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
you today uh I don't think there's a
 
05:09:59.510 --> 05:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
whole lot that I can add Beyond uh a lot
 
05:10:01.910 --> 05:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
of what everyone spoke to before
 
05:10:05.150 --> 05:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
um but when I look at this issue in the
 
05:10:07.430 --> 05:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
way that cannabis is treated a little
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
differently than other uh therapeutic uh
 
05:10:13.250 --> 05:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals and things like that I
 
05:10:15.708 --> 05:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
can't help but think that it kind of
 
05:10:18.470 --> 05:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
stems from a stigma around the use of
 
05:10:21.170 --> 05:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
cannabis and I'm very familiar with that
 
05:10:24.708 --> 05:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
um stigma the reason being that I lost
 
05:10:27.470 --> 05:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
my children's father to heroin overdose
 
05:10:30.948 --> 05:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
14 years ago on Christmas Eve my fiance
 
05:10:33.288 --> 05:10:33.298 align:start position:0%
at the time and I remember a whole lot
 
05:10:36.470 --> 05:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
about the stigma of substance use the
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
interesting thing is is that we have a
 
05:10:39.590 --> 05:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
wealth of information in studies
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
recently that
 
05:10:46.010 --> 05:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh would indicate that a cannabis can be
 
05:10:47.750 --> 05:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
very effective in the treatment of
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder of opiate use
 
05:10:51.770 --> 05:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
disorder particularly
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
um I think a lot of times we look at
 
05:10:56.510 --> 05:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
um we look at cannabis use and we think
 
05:10:58.970 --> 05:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
about as she referred to someone getting
 
05:11:01.610 --> 05:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
high there are a lot of people who
 
05:11:04.190 --> 05:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis use returns them to normal to
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
functioning and I just think that we
 
05:11:07.610 --> 05:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
should kind of take those things into
 
05:11:09.170 --> 05:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
consideration especially when we have
 
05:11:11.890 --> 05:11:11.900 align:start position:0%
such a problem with the overdose crisis
 
05:11:14.208 --> 05:11:14.218 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so this can be
 
05:11:16.490 --> 05:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
something that can help people and if it
 
05:11:18.610 --> 05:11:18.620 align:start position:0%
returns you to a state of functionality
 
05:11:21.650 --> 05:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
being able to function in society and
 
05:11:24.288 --> 05:11:24.298 align:start position:0%
obviously this bill does cover a variety
 
05:11:24.298 --> 05:11:25.788 align:start position:0%
obviously this bill does cover a variety
of

05:11:25.788 --> 05:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:11:30.050 --> 05:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
kind of uh it it uh frames it properly
 
05:11:32.270 --> 05:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
so that uh certain things that we might
 
05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
be concerned about clearly we don't want
 
05:11:37.430 --> 05:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
somebody going to work in being not
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
functional but if cannabis helps people
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
to be functional uh I don't see the
 
05:11:43.730 --> 05:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
problem and I think this bill covers it
 
05:11:45.170 --> 05:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
05:11:48.590 --> 05:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions
 
05:11:50.390 --> 05:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again for your
 
05:11:50.400 --> 05:11:51.368 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again for your
testimony

05:11:51.368 --> 05:11:51.378 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:11:54.110 --> 05:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
next I would like to call co-sponsor
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
Representative silbert
 
05:11:56.878 --> 05:11:58.670 align:start position:0%
Representative silbert

deny sorry
 
05:12:03.708 --> 05:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
my apologies
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:11.330 --> 05:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
hi and I want to thank everyone for
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
hearing me today or being willing to
 
05:12:13.920 --> 05:12:14.930 align:start position:0%
hearing me today or being willing to
listen

05:12:14.930 --> 05:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
listen
 
05:12:17.690 --> 05:12:17.700 align:start position:0%
um like like she said I think a lot of
 
05:12:19.970 --> 05:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
stuff was technically covered that was
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
in my um testimony originally
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
um but just a few things I wanted to
 
05:12:31.070 --> 05:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
point out really about people that use
 
05:12:33.970 --> 05:12:33.980 align:start position:0%
um therapeutic cannabis to be able to
 
05:12:36.288 --> 05:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
you know have be able to continue
 
05:12:39.170 --> 05:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
working and contributing to society
 
05:12:43.128 --> 05:12:43.138 align:start position:0%
without discrimination and this is also
 
05:12:46.190 --> 05:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
for the hiring process of jobs also so I
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make that point so
 
05:12:51.350 --> 05:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
and I think that's it actually all right
 
05:12:54.230 --> 05:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
05:12:56.868 --> 05:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you for your testimony
 
05:12:59.570 --> 05:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
next I would like to call Elizabeth
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
Sargent who is representing the New
 
05:13:04.070 --> 05:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of
 
05:13:07.128 --> 05:13:07.138 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of police has signed a neither
 
05:13:09.708 --> 05:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
opposed or in support of the bill
 
05:13:12.288 --> 05:13:12.298 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon uh chairman members of
 
05:13:14.750 --> 05:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Beth Sargent I
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
work for Champion and capital group here
 
05:13:17.690 --> 05:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
in Concord
 
05:13:19.310 --> 05:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
um a prb for you this afternoon
 
05:13:20.510 --> 05:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
05:13:22.910 --> 05:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police
 
05:13:25.128 --> 05:13:25.138 align:start position:0%
um the Chiefs reviewed this bill and
 
05:13:27.530 --> 05:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
they just wanted to comment on the same
 
05:13:29.230 --> 05:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
section that representative Canuck
 
05:13:32.270 --> 05:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
talked about lines seven and eight and
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
what they would ask if this bill were to
 
05:13:36.190 --> 05:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
move forward is that there be a specific
 
05:13:39.288 --> 05:13:39.298 align:start position:0%
carve out for law enforcement
 
05:13:41.330 --> 05:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
and I can't answer all of the questions
 
05:13:43.010 --> 05:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
that were asked by the committee members
 
05:13:45.288 --> 05:13:45.298 align:start position:0%
but certainly if you wanted to hear from
 
05:13:47.150 --> 05:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
law enforcement a police chief or a drug
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
recognition expert we could arrange for
 
05:13:49.920 --> 05:13:50.868 align:start position:0%
recognition expert we could arrange for
that

05:13:50.868 --> 05:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:13:53.150 --> 05:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
and so that's all I wanted to say thank
 
05:13:55.368 --> 05:13:55.378 align:start position:0%
you I I do have a question if I don't
 
05:13:56.930 --> 05:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
know if you know or if maybe you can get
 
05:13:59.448 --> 05:13:59.458 align:start position:0%
back to the committee uh
 
05:14:03.190 --> 05:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
former representative suggested that the
 
05:14:10.190 --> 05:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement might be covered under
 
05:14:13.250 --> 05:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
that category of federally required is
 
05:14:15.890 --> 05:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
that in fact the case we might be yes so
 
05:14:17.330 --> 05:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see that
 
05:14:19.490 --> 05:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
so if it is
 
05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
if if it's not clear
 
05:14:23.628 --> 05:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
um maybe you can clarify for the
 
05:14:25.788 --> 05:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
committee whether a blanket statement
 
05:14:28.550 --> 05:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
about Federal rules would include law
 
05:14:31.010 --> 05:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement or whether that needs any
 
05:14:33.170 --> 05:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
sort of special treatment or state law
 
05:14:35.030 --> 05:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
we'll find out and get back to you for
 
05:14:35.040 --> 05:14:35.868 align:start position:0%
we'll find out and get back to you for
sure

05:14:35.868 --> 05:14:35.878 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:14:38.410 --> 05:14:38.420 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
05:14:43.610 --> 05:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:46.850 --> 05:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
do the Chiefs of police have a position
 
05:14:50.990 --> 05:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
on uh the use of other drugs uh in the
 
05:14:51.000 --> 05:14:53.448 align:start position:0%
on uh the use of other drugs uh in the
workplace

05:14:53.448 --> 05:14:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:58.430 --> 05:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:00.050 --> 05:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
trying to think how to answer that
 
05:15:00.060 --> 05:15:00.948 align:start position:0%
trying to think how to answer that
question

05:15:00.948 --> 05:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:15:02.448 --> 05:15:02.458 align:start position:0%
um certainly wouldn't be supportive of
 
05:15:05.448 --> 05:15:05.458 align:start position:0%
using drugs in the workplace no
 
05:15:07.430 --> 05:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
so somebody that's treating for back
 
05:15:10.190 --> 05:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
injuries follow-ups Jim so somebody is
 
05:15:11.628 --> 05:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps treating for other pain
 
05:15:14.208 --> 05:15:14.218 align:start position:0%
conditions uh is there a screening
 
05:15:16.610 --> 05:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
process the chiefs of police go through
 
05:15:19.430 --> 05:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
oh okay um screening people that are on
 
05:15:22.250 --> 05:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
various drugs that are prescribed I am
 
05:15:24.470 --> 05:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
not sure about that we've not talked
 
05:15:26.810 --> 05:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
about that thank you
 
05:15:29.330 --> 05:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
05:15:31.190 --> 05:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
I guess they've got a request I'm not
 
05:15:34.610 --> 05:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
sure who it goes to but basically
 
05:15:36.470 --> 05:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
um it's been recommended that we put the
 
05:15:40.610 --> 05:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
the federal reference into the statute
 
05:15:42.288 --> 05:15:42.298 align:start position:0%
um because the feds have already created
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
the laundry list of uh exceptions
 
05:15:48.110 --> 05:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
um is can we get a copy of that laundry

no I don't I don't have the original
 
05:16:17.750 --> 05:16:17.760 align:start position:0%

specific job role is regularly classed
 
05:16:21.350 --> 05:16:21.360 align:start position:0%

document of the Omnibus transportation
 
05:17:17.390 --> 05:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
thing so I cannot vouch perfectly for
 
05:17:19.850 --> 05:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
the uh veracity of it
 
05:17:22.670 --> 05:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
follow up could you uh send that to the

committee please yes sir thank you
 
05:17:28.730 --> 05:17:28.740 align:start position:0%

the Omnibus Transportation employee
 
05:17:32.270 --> 05:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
testing act which I'm sure if we weighed
 
05:17:33.470 --> 05:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
through all three thousand Pages you'll
 
05:17:36.190 --> 05:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
probably find the list somewhere
 
05:17:40.330 --> 05:17:40.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:42.170 --> 05:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
because I don't know that's usually not
 
05:17:43.550 --> 05:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
allowed but I just had that answer for
 
05:17:43.560 --> 05:17:49.850 align:start position:0%
allowed but I just had that answer for
you

05:17:49.850 --> 05:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:52.430 --> 05:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
a CA that is here that the National
 
05:17:55.310 --> 05:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
Guard folks probably also fell under
 
05:17:57.770 --> 05:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
that same federal law well they would
 
05:17:57.780 --> 05:17:58.670 align:start position:0%
that same federal law well they would
under

05:17:58.670 --> 05:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:18:01.010 --> 05:18:01.020 align:start position:0%

I believe that um
 
05:19:08.930 --> 05:19:08.940 align:start position:0%

opportunity to use cannabis
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
I will use it let me tell you
 
05:19:19.070 --> 05:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
as someone who have chronic pain I have
 
05:19:21.050 --> 05:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
days that um
 
05:19:23.930 --> 05:19:23.940 align:start position:0%

um
moving

05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%

05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
I have days that um my joy hurts very
 
05:19:37.320 --> 05:19:38.930 align:start position:0%
I have days that um my joy hurts very
much

05:19:38.930 --> 05:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:19:41.628 --> 05:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
but I always afraid
 
05:19:43.910 --> 05:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
that I will apply for a job
 
05:19:46.970 --> 05:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
that requires me to go through uh drug
 
05:19:50.930 --> 05:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
testing and not pass drug testing and be
 
05:19:53.628 --> 05:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
disqualified to get the job because I'm
 
05:19:55.910 --> 05:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
using cannabis for pain
 
05:19:59.270 --> 05:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm someone who struggled with pain
 
05:20:01.490 --> 05:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
from the day the time that I get up in
 
05:20:03.170 --> 05:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
the morning until the time that I go to
 
05:20:07.490 --> 05:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
bed I'm in pain 24 7.
 
05:20:10.368 --> 05:20:10.378 align:start position:0%
I have days that I wish
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
um I can utilize the Cannabis but like I
 
05:20:14.930 --> 05:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
always remind myself
 
05:20:17.030 --> 05:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
how about if you get laid off on your
 
05:20:17.040 --> 05:20:18.170 align:start position:0%
how about if you get laid off on your
job

05:20:18.170 --> 05:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
job
 
05:20:20.690 --> 05:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
and you need to apply for a job
 
05:20:22.970 --> 05:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
in one of the qualifications is you you
 
05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
have to go through drop testing and even
 
05:20:28.610 --> 05:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
though that you have this medical card
 
05:20:30.770 --> 05:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
but you still then probably not gonna
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
qualify for the job
 
05:20:35.090 --> 05:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reason that I'm
 
05:20:37.490 --> 05:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
asking you to support this bill
 
05:20:40.070 --> 05:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
is someone that in which
 
05:20:42.650 --> 05:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
can utilize the Cannabis but I haven't
 
05:20:45.890 --> 05:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:48.770 --> 05:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
right now I'm in pain if I go to the
 
05:20:50.810 --> 05:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
hospital right now and they ask me
 
05:20:53.570 --> 05:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
can you tell me for one to ten
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
how can you tell me how high is your
 
05:21:00.110 --> 05:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
pain I will tell you that I have eight
 
05:21:02.270 --> 05:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
I feel like tremendous pain right now
 
05:21:04.368 --> 05:21:04.378 align:start position:0%
coming from my feet all the way to my
 
05:21:06.890 --> 05:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
neck I feel like I'm getting numb my
 
05:21:09.530 --> 05:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
body is getting numb
 
05:21:11.150 --> 05:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
but I'm afraid to take any pain
 
05:21:11.160 --> 05:21:12.230 align:start position:0%
but I'm afraid to take any pain
medication

05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
medication
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
I don't take any pain medication I can
 
05:21:16.850 --> 05:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
tell you that I take maybe one Tylenol a
 
05:21:16.860 --> 05:21:18.470 align:start position:0%
tell you that I take maybe one Tylenol a
day

05:21:18.470 --> 05:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:21:22.010 --> 05:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
and that's all I take because I'm afraid
 
05:21:23.690 --> 05:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking you to support
 
05:21:26.090 --> 05:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
this bill for people like myself
 
05:21:28.250 --> 05:21:28.260 align:start position:0%

05:21:30.170 --> 05:21:30.180 align:start position:0%

05:22:30.170 --> 05:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
currently I try to be their voice I try
 
05:22:32.270 --> 05:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
to express their thoughts and what their
 
05:22:34.128 --> 05:22:34.138 align:start position:0%
opinions are
 
05:22:36.650 --> 05:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
and in this situation I will tell you
 
05:22:41.150 --> 05:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
that this bill will impact at some point
 
05:22:44.448 --> 05:22:44.458 align:start position:0%
in time every single individual that
 
05:22:48.170 --> 05:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
currently holds or will be seeking a
 
05:22:50.510 --> 05:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis card
 
05:22:54.650 --> 05:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
I think that the root of this bill is
 
05:22:57.288 --> 05:22:57.298 align:start position:0%
wonderful I think that it is long
 
05:23:00.410 --> 05:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
overdue and it is something that should
 
05:23:02.208 --> 05:23:02.218 align:start position:0%
be addressed
 
05:23:05.690 --> 05:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
we have hundreds if not thousands of
 
05:23:08.930 --> 05:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
patients that could potentially come off
 
05:23:12.890 --> 05:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
of disability or public services and
 
05:23:14.948 --> 05:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
rejoin the workforce
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the areas that they were trained and
 
05:23:21.288 --> 05:23:21.298 align:start position:0%
have skills in but because they are a
 
05:23:24.288 --> 05:23:24.298 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis card holder they
 
05:23:26.930 --> 05:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
are not able to do so and it kind of
 
05:23:29.628 --> 05:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
hinders them you know I had heard
 
05:23:32.270 --> 05:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
earlier someone testify about having a
 
05:23:35.750 --> 05:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
card is a privilege and we're worried
 
05:23:38.510 --> 05:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
about losing our privilege I would like
 
05:23:40.910 --> 05:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
to take it one step further and tell you
 
05:23:45.050 --> 05:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
that has a therapeutic cannabis card
 
05:23:45.060 --> 05:23:46.250 align:start position:0%
that has a therapeutic cannabis card
holder

05:23:46.250 --> 05:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
holder
 
05:23:50.930 --> 05:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
I myself have agreed that if I violate
 
05:23:53.930 --> 05:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program in any
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
way shape or form I will be charged with
 
05:24:01.010 --> 05:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
felony charges
 
05:24:05.990 --> 05:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
so although yes it is a privilege I want
 
05:24:08.510 --> 05:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
you to understand what a therapeutic
 
05:24:11.990 --> 05:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient is actually doing when
 
05:24:15.170 --> 05:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
they join the program they are agreeing
 
05:24:18.770 --> 05:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
to follow state law and and program
 
05:24:21.530 --> 05:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations and if they
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
violate those rules or regulations they
 
05:24:28.430 --> 05:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
will be charged more harshly
 
05:24:31.850 --> 05:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
than an individual who does not possess
 
05:24:34.910 --> 05:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
a therapeutic cannabis card and I think
 
05:24:37.550 --> 05:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's really important for people to
 
05:24:41.448 --> 05:24:41.458 align:start position:0%
understand because that shows the degree
 
05:24:44.330 --> 05:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
of responsibility that a patient is
 
05:24:46.368 --> 05:24:46.378 align:start position:0%
taking on when they join this program
 
05:24:49.010 --> 05:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
and I think that should be acknowledged
 
05:24:52.128 --> 05:24:52.138 align:start position:0%
I think that that is a very important
 
05:24:55.368 --> 05:24:55.378 align:start position:0%
factor to consider you know we are not
 
05:24:59.030 --> 05:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
just looking for an Avenue to be able to
 
05:24:59.040 --> 05:25:00.850 align:start position:0%
just looking for an Avenue to be able to
use

05:25:00.850 --> 05:25:00.860 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:25:04.730 --> 05:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
cannabis and get high or have a good
 
05:25:07.910 --> 05:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
time or anything like that we are
 
05:25:09.948 --> 05:25:09.958 align:start position:0%
accepting these responsibilities because
 
05:25:13.550 --> 05:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
we want to make changes to our lives we
 
05:25:16.430 --> 05:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
want to be able to rejoin society as
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
functioning individuals
 
05:25:20.708 --> 05:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
we are constantly held back
 
05:25:23.628 --> 05:25:23.638 align:start position:0%
discriminated against and ridiculed for
 
05:25:26.590 --> 05:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
our choices to use therapeutic cannabis
 
05:25:29.750 --> 05:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
especially in the employment Arena I
 
05:25:31.850 --> 05:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
heard questions in regards to how many
 
05:25:34.150 --> 05:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
state reps use therapeutic cannabis
 
05:25:37.490 --> 05:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
currently well let me tell you that for
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
the few that publicly admit to using
 
05:25:42.650 --> 05:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and holding a card
 
05:25:46.128 --> 05:25:46.138 align:start position:0%
there are so many more individuals that
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
will not admit it publicly because they
 
05:25:52.190 --> 05:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
are afraid of the stigma and the
 
05:25:54.170 --> 05:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
discrimination and the possible
 
05:25:56.810 --> 05:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
potential in some cases retaliation
 
05:26:00.948 --> 05:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
against them and that is unfair
 
05:26:05.830 --> 05:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
um I do myself also have concerns
 
05:26:10.250 --> 05:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
with seven and eight that this section
 
05:26:12.770 --> 05:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
shall not apply to employment where drug
 
05:26:14.750 --> 05:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
screening tests are required for the
 
05:26:17.448 --> 05:26:17.458 align:start position:0%
safety of persons and property at the
 
05:26:19.550 --> 05:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
job site now
 
05:26:22.010 --> 05:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know all the big fancy words I
 
05:26:24.050 --> 05:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
don't know all the big fancy terms but
 
05:26:26.150 --> 05:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is that this
 
05:26:30.470 --> 05:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
basically allows an employer to say that
 
05:26:33.410 --> 05:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
any position or job that they have
 
05:26:36.170 --> 05:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
within their business falls under this
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
category so a shopping bag packer at
 
05:26:44.090 --> 05:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
dumoulies could fall under this category
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know I think that that either needs
 
05:26:49.990 --> 05:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
to be removed or even
 
05:26:54.050 --> 05:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
expanded to include a caveat on
 
05:26:57.230 --> 05:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
following federal regulations in regards
 
05:27:00.430 --> 05:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
to what positions require
 
05:27:02.628 --> 05:27:02.638 align:start position:0%
drug screening
 
05:27:06.110 --> 05:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
personally myself I will tell you that I
 
05:27:08.270 --> 05:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
would love to be able to get to a point
 
05:27:11.090 --> 05:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
where the state of New Hampshire just
 
05:27:15.470 --> 05:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
removes cannabis all together from the
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
list of
 
05:27:20.170 --> 05:27:20.180 align:start position:0%
things that can be tested for
 
05:27:23.810 --> 05:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
using drug testing I heard questions in
 
05:27:26.628 --> 05:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
regards to you know is there a way how
 
05:27:28.730 --> 05:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
are we supposed to monitor this how can
 
05:27:32.150 --> 05:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
we determine and I will tell you that it
 
05:27:36.110 --> 05:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
is very easy to distinguish an
 
05:27:39.948 --> 05:27:39.958 align:start position:0%
individual who is incapacitated and
 
05:27:42.288 --> 05:27:42.298 align:start position:0%
Under the Influence whether it is
 
05:27:44.890 --> 05:27:44.900 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis alcohol
 
05:27:49.190 --> 05:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
opioids or any other substance they're
 
05:27:51.110 --> 05:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
going to have poor work performance
 
05:27:53.930 --> 05:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
they're going to have their
 
05:27:55.730 --> 05:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
communication skills going to be
 
05:27:58.390 --> 05:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
impacted their visual
 
05:28:00.708 --> 05:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
impairment is going to be extremely
 
05:28:03.530 --> 05:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
noticeable I will
 
05:28:03.540 --> 05:28:05.090 align:start position:0%
noticeable I will
foreign

05:28:05.090 --> 05:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:28:09.530 --> 05:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
I personally have one area where I
 
05:28:11.510 --> 05:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
consume my cannabis because I am a
 
05:28:13.910 --> 05:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
mother of three children so I choose to
 
05:28:16.128 --> 05:28:16.138 align:start position:0%
consume in an area safely that my
 
05:28:18.350 --> 05:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
children are not allowed to be in
 
05:28:22.550 --> 05:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
so I would honestly not use the word
 
05:28:27.288 --> 05:28:27.298 align:start position:0%
smell anywhere in this because you don't
 
05:28:30.890 --> 05:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
have to consume cannabis in order to
 
05:28:34.010 --> 05:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
have the smell of cannabis on your
 
05:28:38.628 --> 05:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
clothing you can literally just be in an
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
area where cannabis was or has been
 
05:28:44.930 --> 05:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
consumed because like cigarette smoke or
 
05:28:48.288 --> 05:28:48.298 align:start position:0%
like many other air pollutants it does
 
05:28:51.590 --> 05:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
absorb into clothing and it it can
 
05:28:54.890 --> 05:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
absorb into the areas so it can
 
05:28:58.990 --> 05:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
kind of linger for a while so to speak
 
05:29:01.850 --> 05:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
05:29:06.288 --> 05:29:06.298 align:start position:0%
this needs to happen I I think that you
 
05:29:08.448 --> 05:29:08.458 align:start position:0%
need to look at this bill along with
 
05:29:10.850 --> 05:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
every other representative that's going
 
05:29:12.770 --> 05:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
to look at this bill make the small
 
05:29:16.070 --> 05:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
changes that we've suggested making and
 
05:29:20.030 --> 05:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
do this because we
 
05:29:22.550 --> 05:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity
 
05:29:26.270 --> 05:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
to peel a layer off of discriminating
 
05:29:29.690 --> 05:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
against therapeutic cannabis you have an
 
05:29:32.030 --> 05:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
obligation to your constituents to
 
05:29:34.610 --> 05:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
protect them you have an obligation to
 
05:29:38.448 --> 05:29:38.458 align:start position:0%
help promote Financial Freedom and
 
05:29:41.150 --> 05:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
success and accountability for an
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
individual and this is one step to do it
 
05:29:46.910 --> 05:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
we deserve these protections we deserve
 
05:29:50.208 --> 05:29:50.218 align:start position:0%
the chance to be able to return to jobs
 
05:29:52.550 --> 05:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
and positions that we have currently
 
05:29:55.128 --> 05:29:55.138 align:start position:0%
been held back from because of our
 
05:29:58.368 --> 05:29:58.378 align:start position:0%
choice to better our health
 
05:30:01.128 --> 05:30:01.138 align:start position:0%
um I want to thank you all and I am more
 
05:30:03.890 --> 05:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
than happy to answer any questions
 
05:30:07.550 --> 05:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
05:30:09.830 --> 05:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you again for your
 
05:30:13.490 --> 05:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
testimony if someone could pass up the
 
05:30:16.670 --> 05:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
sign-in sheet for 82 I'd appreciate that
 
05:30:16.680 --> 05:30:18.070 align:start position:0%
sign-in sheet for 82 I'd appreciate that
and

05:30:18.070 --> 05:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:30:28.610 --> 05:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:30.470 --> 05:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement actually isn't under the
 
05:30:31.850 --> 05:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Transportation Act it's under
 
05:30:33.430 --> 05:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
the executive order from Ronald
 
05:30:36.410 --> 05:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
reagan12564 I'm composing an email to
 
05:30:38.570 --> 05:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
you we'll direct you to it I pulled it
 
05:30:40.730 --> 05:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
up and it's uh it's listed in there for
 
05:30:42.530 --> 05:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
law enforcement that's where that
 
05:30:44.990 --> 05:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
resides all right thank you
 
05:30:47.890 --> 05:30:47.900 align:start position:0%
it does that apply to Firefighters
 
05:30:51.730 --> 05:30:51.740 align:start position:0%
he mentioned that the firefighters was
 
05:30:56.090 --> 05:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
not required but the federal law allowed
 
05:30:56.100 --> 05:30:58.868 align:start position:0%
not required but the federal law allowed
right

05:30:58.868 --> 05:30:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:02.510 --> 05:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
that again is from a um employment blog
 
05:31:04.550 --> 05:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
which I cannot vouch for the veracity of
 
05:31:06.288 --> 05:31:06.298 align:start position:0%
that this other part I've actually found
 
05:31:07.970 --> 05:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
in the stand in the executive order from
 
05:31:11.690 --> 05:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:13.850 --> 05:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
so before I read this
 
05:31:16.730 --> 05:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
um we obviously had some suggestions for
 
05:31:19.570 --> 05:31:19.580 align:start position:0%
changes today I also
 
05:31:24.350 --> 05:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh now appreciate this is an issue that
 
05:31:26.930 --> 05:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
can get complex as it's an interaction
 
05:31:30.110 --> 05:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
of federal law state law existing court
 
05:31:30.120 --> 05:31:32.030 align:start position:0%
of federal law state law existing court
cases

05:31:32.030 --> 05:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
cases
 
05:31:34.010 --> 05:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
um and I'll say I had a discussion with
 
05:31:36.410 --> 05:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
the chairman last night about this and
 
05:31:38.868 --> 05:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
we think this should go to a
 
05:31:41.208 --> 05:31:41.218 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to help us understand these
 
05:31:42.368 --> 05:31:42.378 align:start position:0%
issues better
 
05:31:45.050 --> 05:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
since the chairman gets the big bucks
 
05:31:47.868 --> 05:31:47.878 align:start position:0%
that I don't get I am going to leave it
 
05:31:50.330 --> 05:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
to him to appoint that subcommittee but
 
05:31:53.628 --> 05:31:53.638 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd ask the committee to plan on
 
05:31:56.628 --> 05:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
that being what where we take the bill
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
if someone has an interest in that uh
 
05:32:03.230 --> 05:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
feel free to email or message the the
 
05:32:04.788 --> 05:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
chair and
 
05:32:07.610 --> 05:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
um as as we put together who will serve
 
05:32:11.390 --> 05:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
on that question please go ahead
 
05:32:13.250 --> 05:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh we're going to
 
05:32:14.330 --> 05:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
hear from the Department of Labor on
 
05:32:14.340 --> 05:32:16.128 align:start position:0%
hear from the Department of Labor on
this

05:32:16.128 --> 05:32:16.138 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:32:21.410 --> 05:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
they did not sign up uh to speak on it
 
05:32:24.890 --> 05:32:24.900 align:start position:0%
but if you want to ask a question and
 
05:32:27.050 --> 05:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
have the department answer it you you
 
05:32:28.670 --> 05:32:28.680 align:start position:0%

05:32:32.208 --> 05:32:32.218 align:start position:0%
all right so if you could come up and
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%

if when you're done you could fill out a
 
05:32:38.690 --> 05:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
pink card so we can put that in the
 
05:32:43.670 --> 05:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:43.680 --> 05:32:46.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:32:46.810 --> 05:32:46.820 align:start position:0%

05:33:08.270 --> 05:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:10.490 --> 05:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
sections three of the line stream Forest
 
05:33:12.470 --> 05:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
is no employment show tonight employment
 
05:33:15.110 --> 05:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
however seven eight and nine talk about
 
05:33:16.368 --> 05:33:16.378 align:start position:0%
nothing in the section shall be
 
05:33:17.868 --> 05:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
construed to require an employer to
 
05:33:19.250 --> 05:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
allow being impaired by cannabis
 
05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
products while at work how would the
 
05:33:27.530 --> 05:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:31.730 --> 05:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:33.770 --> 05:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
yeah basically what we're talking about
 
05:33:34.970 --> 05:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
here would have to
 
05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
have navigation we'd have
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
we'd have termination as to whether or
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
not there actually was an intoxication
 
05:33:41.040 --> 05:33:42.830 align:start position:0%
not there actually was an intoxication
or

05:33:42.830 --> 05:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:33:46.730 --> 05:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
um an incapacitation shall we say of uh
 
05:33:49.730 --> 05:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis or whatever the
 
05:33:53.390 --> 05:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
positive drug test was section 14 under
 
05:33:57.288 --> 05:33:57.298 align:start position:0%
281 a of the workers compensation act
 
05:34:00.410 --> 05:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
talks about personal uh fault and
 
05:34:02.628 --> 05:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
employee fault in the workplace as far
 
05:34:05.810 --> 05:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
as the cause of an injury and that also
 
05:34:08.050 --> 05:34:08.060 align:start position:0%
incorporates intoxication
 
05:34:10.250 --> 05:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
there are there's been a lot of
 
05:34:12.410 --> 05:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
discussion about different kinds of
 
05:34:15.350 --> 05:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
medications that people are taking while
 
05:34:17.868 --> 05:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
they're at work there's been discussion
 
05:34:20.208 --> 05:34:20.218 align:start position:0%
about the safety of those what has to be
 
05:34:24.770 --> 05:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
proven under 281 A14 is that the actual
 
05:34:29.810 --> 05:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
impact of the drug alcohol and or in
 
05:34:32.270 --> 05:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
this case positive therapeutic cannabis
 
05:34:35.448 --> 05:34:35.458 align:start position:0%
did that impact or did that cause the
 
05:34:38.150 --> 05:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
injury that occurred at work so it's
 
05:34:40.190 --> 05:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
almost a two-fold test that has to be
 
05:34:42.708 --> 05:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
met pursuant to that particular statute
 
05:34:44.208 --> 05:34:44.218 align:start position:0%
it's not just that it was a positive
 
05:34:47.390 --> 05:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
test but did it actually cause the
 
05:34:49.490 --> 05:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
injury that occurred I know that wasn't
 
05:34:50.990 --> 05:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
completely your question I might have
 
05:34:52.670 --> 05:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
you repeat it just to make sure that I
 
05:34:55.250 --> 05:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
understand and I I get your answer as
 
05:34:58.368 --> 05:34:58.378 align:start position:0%
best I can gonna go away follow up thank
 
05:35:00.948 --> 05:35:00.958 align:start position:0%
you that was my next question as to how
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
workman's compensation would look at
 
05:35:03.948 --> 05:35:03.958 align:start position:0%
that as well if they were impaired while
 
05:35:05.690 --> 05:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
at work and got injured or injured one
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
of their co-workers would workman's
 
05:35:08.638 --> 05:35:10.010 align:start position:0%
of their co-workers would workman's
compensation

05:35:10.010 --> 05:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
a cover this and B would the employer be
 
05:35:14.990 --> 05:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
on the hook for allowing the employee to
 
05:35:16.910 --> 05:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
work impaired
 
05:35:19.190 --> 05:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
with causing injury at the workplace
 
05:35:21.170 --> 05:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm going to refer back to
 
05:35:23.330 --> 05:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
section 14 of the workers compensation
 
05:35:27.288 --> 05:35:27.298 align:start position:0%
act so it's 281 a colon 14 if you want
 
05:35:29.510 --> 05:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
to look at it it's not entitled
 
05:35:31.610 --> 05:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
intoxication it's entitled employee
 
05:35:31.620 --> 05:35:32.708 align:start position:0%
intoxication it's entitled employee
fault

05:35:32.708 --> 05:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
fault
 
05:35:35.208 --> 05:35:35.218 align:start position:0%
but looking at that and the way it's
 
05:35:37.610 --> 05:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
looked at at a department level hearing
 
05:35:40.330 --> 05:35:40.340 align:start position:0%
is number one if the employer is aware
 
05:35:43.430 --> 05:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
that the employee is intoxicated knows
 
05:35:45.170 --> 05:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
that they go out at lunch time and and
 
05:35:48.110 --> 05:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
has some form of alcoholic beverage or
 
05:35:52.430 --> 05:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
or another type of intoxicating item and
 
05:35:54.350 --> 05:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
they allow that person to come back to
 
05:35:56.830 --> 05:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
work the employer cannot then use
 
05:35:59.868 --> 05:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
employee fault as a defense against a
 
05:36:01.850 --> 05:36:01.860 align:start position:0%
workers compensation claim they the
 
05:36:03.948 --> 05:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
employer may be on the hook
 
05:36:06.590 --> 05:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
the next level is what we discussed a
 
05:36:09.970 --> 05:36:09.980 align:start position:0%
few minutes ago is that was that
 
05:36:13.850 --> 05:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
intoxication that impact of whatever was
 
05:36:17.150 --> 05:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
taken did that actually cause the injury
 
05:36:19.070 --> 05:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
all of these things have to be
 
05:36:21.288 --> 05:36:21.298 align:start position:0%
determined in causal hearing at the
 
05:36:23.930 --> 05:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and there would be
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
basically there would be a burden of
 
05:36:27.650 --> 05:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
proof on both sides that would have to
 
05:36:30.650 --> 05:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
be required on that
 
05:36:32.330 --> 05:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:36:34.190 --> 05:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for the
 
05:36:35.750 --> 05:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor what if I have a
 
05:36:39.590 --> 05:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
question uh the term intoxicated yeah is
 
05:36:42.610 --> 05:36:42.620 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks this is fancy stuff now
 
05:36:44.810 --> 05:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
I do
 
05:36:47.390 --> 05:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
um intoxication uh if I understand
 
05:36:49.010 --> 05:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
you're right that could be a pretty
 
05:36:51.470 --> 05:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
broad sweeping kind of thing it's drugs
 
05:36:53.270 --> 05:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's alcohol those kinds of things
 
05:36:56.448 --> 05:36:56.458 align:start position:0%
correct yes thank you
 
05:36:58.788 --> 05:36:58.798 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
05:37:00.770 --> 05:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for stepping up for
 
05:37:00.780 --> 05:37:02.330 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for stepping up for
us

seven uh signed in in row and there was
 
05:37:19.128 --> 05:37:19.138 align:start position:0%
one signed in an opposition
 
05:37:22.430 --> 05:37:22.440 align:start position:0%

05:37:43.550 --> 05:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
I set aside my title so I won't read
 
05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
that right now and instead ask the prime
 
05:37:50.930 --> 05:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
sponsor to introduce it
 
05:37:52.788 --> 05:37:52.798 align:start position:0%

05:38:05.090 --> 05:38:05.100 align:start position:0%

05:38:19.128 --> 05:38:19.138 align:start position:0%
playing field between employers and
 
05:38:20.448 --> 05:38:20.458 align:start position:0%
those wishing to organize their
 
05:38:22.310 --> 05:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
co-workers in labor
 
05:38:24.770 --> 05:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
last year I co- I co-sponsored the wrong
 
05:38:26.810 --> 05:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
Bill to accomplish this task
 
05:38:29.208 --> 05:38:29.218 align:start position:0%
last year I co-sponsored a bill that
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
would ban outright employers from
 
05:38:33.830 --> 05:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
putting on anti-union rating sessions
 
05:38:35.690 --> 05:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
these training sessions occur often at
 
05:38:37.430 --> 05:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
the point of higher as part of an
 
05:38:40.190 --> 05:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
employee's regular onboarding in that
 
05:38:42.830 --> 05:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
individual session an employee often has
 
05:38:44.930 --> 05:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
to watch a video in which a friendly
 
05:38:46.910 --> 05:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
looking actor tells the employee that
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
our company is a family and that if you
 
05:38:51.830 --> 05:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
hear Union chatter tell your supervisor
 
05:38:53.750 --> 05:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
the video from an Amazon shift lead
 
05:38:56.090 --> 05:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
training teaches leads to listen for
 
05:38:58.190 --> 05:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
words like living wage Steward and
 
05:38:59.510 --> 05:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
bathroom breaks
 
05:39:01.670 --> 05:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
after that the video is often depict a
 
05:39:03.470 --> 05:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
gruff-looking man in a leather jacket
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
and a mob-like accent trying to cast
 
05:39:07.670 --> 05:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
organizers in a negative light
 
05:39:09.350 --> 05:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
while these sessions occur during the
 
05:39:11.690 --> 05:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
hiring process they are an effort to
 
05:39:13.670 --> 05:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
preempt organizing
 
05:39:15.110 --> 05:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
they are often employees first
 
05:39:16.550 --> 05:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
impression and we know that first
 
05:39:18.470 --> 05:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
impressions are important
 
05:39:20.990 --> 05:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
if an organizing effort does occur these
 
05:39:22.970 --> 05:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
sessions are opted often captive
 
05:39:25.310 --> 05:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
audience and ratcheted up
 
05:39:27.470 --> 05:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
an employer can mandate employees to
 
05:39:29.750 --> 05:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
attend them they're on property and
 
05:39:31.128 --> 05:39:31.138 align:start position:0%
they're on the clock
 
05:39:32.930 --> 05:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
while the employer can hold staff
 
05:39:35.090 --> 05:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
captive to make their case organizers do
 
05:39:37.310 --> 05:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
not have the same opportunity
 
05:39:39.050 --> 05:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
the legislation last year was wrong
 
05:39:40.490 --> 05:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
because it attempted to ban these
 
05:39:42.288 --> 05:39:42.298 align:start position:0%
trainings outright it was clunky and
 
05:39:44.510 --> 05:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
hard to enforce all this bill does is
 
05:39:46.310 --> 05:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
make it a choice
 
05:39:48.530 --> 05:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
employers will say the choice to
 
05:39:50.510 --> 05:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
organize is the employees alone
 
05:39:52.430 --> 05:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
but if one party can fire you for
 
05:39:54.170 --> 05:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
insubordination if you won't attend
 
05:39:56.030 --> 05:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
their cheerleading session and the other
 
05:39:58.128 --> 05:39:58.138 align:start position:0%
isn't allowed on property is that a
 
05:39:58.138 --> 05:39:59.030 align:start position:0%
isn't allowed on property is that a
choice

05:39:59.030 --> 05:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
choice
 
05:40:01.070 --> 05:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
I completely understand the desire of an
 
05:40:02.570 --> 05:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
employer to argue a union isn't
 
05:40:03.830 --> 05:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
necessary in their specific best
 
05:40:05.448 --> 05:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
interests and that's why this is an
 
05:40:06.830 --> 05:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
option bill
 
05:40:08.750 --> 05:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
with this law an employee gets a
 
05:40:10.850 --> 05:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
stress-free opportunity to give a fair
 
05:40:13.730 --> 05:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
hearing to both their employer and labor
 
05:40:13.740 --> 05:40:14.868 align:start position:0%
hearing to both their employer and labor
organizers

05:40:14.868 --> 05:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
organizers
 
05:40:16.368 --> 05:40:16.378 align:start position:0%
they get to feel good knowing that they
 
05:40:17.868 --> 05:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
made an informed decision about whether
 
05:40:19.850 --> 05:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
or not to sign a union card I would ask
 
05:40:22.730 --> 05:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
that the committee move this OTP and I'm
 
05:40:24.708 --> 05:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
taking I can take any questions thank
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.110 --> 05:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
I see none so thank you for your
 
05:40:30.120 --> 05:40:32.208 align:start position:0%
I see none so thank you for your
testimony

05:40:32.208 --> 05:40:32.218 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:40:36.368 --> 05:40:36.378 align:start position:0%
next I would ask Jan Shafer
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
testifying on her own behalf in support
 
05:40:46.970 --> 05:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:49.368 --> 05:40:49.378 align:start position:0%
my name is Jan Schaefer
 
05:40:54.650 --> 05:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
um I won one large two three sorry thank
 
05:40:57.770 --> 05:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
you uh my name is Jan shaper I live in
 
05:40:59.690 --> 05:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
Warner New Hampshire
 
05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
um and I um thank you for allowing me to
 
05:41:04.850 --> 05:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
appear today to give testimony on this
 
05:41:04.860 --> 05:41:06.230 align:start position:0%
appear today to give testimony on this
bill

05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:41:10.550 --> 05:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
um I am retired but I spent 30 years 30
 
05:41:12.590 --> 05:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
or more years of my life
 
05:41:15.470 --> 05:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
um working helping workers organize
 
05:41:15.480 --> 05:41:16.610 align:start position:0%
um working helping workers organize
unions

05:41:16.610 --> 05:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
unions
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
and I think the sponsor of this bill
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
just gave a really uh straightforward
 
05:41:24.350 --> 05:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
look at
 
05:41:29.208 --> 05:41:29.218 align:start position:0%
um what would make uh organizing
 
05:41:32.090 --> 05:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
more would level the playing field
 
05:41:33.970 --> 05:41:33.980 align:start position:0%
um currently
 
05:41:36.610 --> 05:41:36.620 align:start position:0%
employers can
 
05:41:40.510 --> 05:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
force workers to go to meetings
 
05:41:40.520 --> 05:41:42.170 align:start position:0%
force workers to go to meetings
and

05:41:42.170 --> 05:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:41:44.030 --> 05:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
can then
 
05:41:45.830 --> 05:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
really tell them pretty much anything
 
05:41:49.850 --> 05:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
about the union the union all Union
 
05:41:52.490 --> 05:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
meetings are held off site
 
05:41:54.410 --> 05:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
um the unions generally are not allowed
 
05:41:56.868 --> 05:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
in the work site
 
05:41:56.878 --> 05:41:58.010 align:start position:0%
in the work site
um

05:41:58.010 --> 05:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
and these meetings can be pretty
 
05:42:03.230 --> 05:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
intimidating to workers
 
05:42:03.240 --> 05:42:03.770 align:start position:0%
intimidating to workers
um

05:42:03.770 --> 05:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:06.110 --> 05:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
and I actually just wanted to talk about
 
05:42:09.050 --> 05:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
two campaigns that I worked on that had
 
05:42:11.570 --> 05:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
very they had the same result but the
 
05:42:14.150 --> 05:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
atmosphere was really different
 
05:42:16.910 --> 05:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
um they were two Hospital campaigns uh
 
05:42:18.770 --> 05:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
one with nurses
 
05:42:21.070 --> 05:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
um both of them with nurses
 
05:42:24.890 --> 05:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
one of the hospitals hired uh at Great
 
05:42:28.090 --> 05:42:28.100 align:start position:0%
expense on anti-union Law Firm
 
05:42:31.010 --> 05:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
I think they spent over three million
 
05:42:35.090 --> 05:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
dollars on this law firm and they had
 
05:42:38.690 --> 05:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
mandatory meetings nurses were forced
 
05:42:40.910 --> 05:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
on while they were at work to go to
 
05:42:43.610 --> 05:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
meetings to hear
 
05:42:46.250 --> 05:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
um all the reasons that the union was a
 
05:42:48.650 --> 05:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
bad idea
 
05:42:52.010 --> 05:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
um the employer went so far in this case
 
05:42:54.830 --> 05:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
as to actually pay someone to make a
 
05:42:54.840 --> 05:42:56.208 align:start position:0%
as to actually pay someone to make a
film

05:42:56.208 --> 05:42:56.218 align:start position:0%
film
 
05:42:59.330 --> 05:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
um about strikes a particular strike in
 
05:43:02.390 --> 05:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
Vermont the film was edited
 
05:43:05.530 --> 05:43:05.540 align:start position:0%
um put the Union in a horrible light and
 
05:43:09.010 --> 05:43:09.020 align:start position:0%
there was no recourse to
 
05:43:12.650 --> 05:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
correct the record at that point
 
05:43:14.930 --> 05:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
um they the nurses did vote for the
 
05:43:16.610 --> 05:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
union they won
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
um the other hospital was a slightly
 
05:43:24.788 --> 05:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
smaller hospital but they did not hire a
 
05:43:28.490 --> 05:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
anti-labor law firm and their meetings
 
05:43:30.910 --> 05:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
were completely voluntary
 
05:43:34.670 --> 05:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
as were the Union meetings well
 
05:43:36.770 --> 05:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
actually the word the nurses didn't go
 
05:43:38.990 --> 05:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
to either meeting they didn't go to the
 
05:43:40.670 --> 05:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
employers meeting and they didn't go to
 
05:43:42.708 --> 05:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
the union meeting but they did vote for
 
05:43:43.628 --> 05:43:43.638 align:start position:0%
the union
 
05:43:46.310 --> 05:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
they obviously felt that they had enough
 
05:43:48.230 --> 05:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
information to make an informed decision
 
05:43:50.208 --> 05:43:50.218 align:start position:0%
and they chose to be represented by a
 
05:43:54.288 --> 05:43:54.298 align:start position:0%
union the anti-union sector of our
 
05:43:57.530 --> 05:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
economy in 2019
 
05:44:01.430 --> 05:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
um was 340 million dollars I believe
 
05:44:04.850 --> 05:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
um so it's a big industry and
 
05:44:10.250 --> 05:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
um it is intent its intent is to
 
05:44:13.128 --> 05:44:13.138 align:start position:0%
intimidate workers into not joining a
 
05:44:13.138 --> 05:44:14.510 align:start position:0%
intimidate workers into not joining a
union

05:44:14.510 --> 05:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
union
 
05:44:14.520 --> 05:44:16.490 align:start position:0%
union
um

05:44:16.490 --> 05:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:19.310 --> 05:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
you know you hear a lot about oh I hear
 
05:44:21.650 --> 05:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
often about you know unions are a thing
 
05:44:23.208 --> 05:44:23.218 align:start position:0%
of the past right
 
05:44:25.670 --> 05:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
but unions have changed a lot the
 
05:44:27.590 --> 05:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
conditions for workers haven't changed
 
05:44:30.708 --> 05:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
that much there are still reasons that
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
workers choose to join unions
 
05:44:36.350 --> 05:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
um it's not always pay sometimes a lot
 
05:44:38.330 --> 05:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
of times it's about respect for the
 
05:44:40.750 --> 05:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
nurses in both situations it was about
 
05:44:44.868 --> 05:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
short staffing they wanted more Staffing
 
05:44:44.878 --> 05:44:46.368 align:start position:0%
short staffing they wanted more Staffing
um

05:44:46.368 --> 05:44:46.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:48.830 --> 05:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
but I also think we're looking at a new
 
05:44:51.590 --> 05:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
time not just for unions but also for
 
05:44:54.230 --> 05:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
employers and I have for you an article
 
05:44:55.970 --> 05:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
from the Harvard Business Review that
 
05:45:00.048 --> 05:45:00.058 align:start position:0%
was just written about new ways for
 
05:45:02.510 --> 05:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
employers to interact with organizing
 
05:45:02.520 --> 05:45:03.610 align:start position:0%
employers to interact with organizing
drives

05:45:03.610 --> 05:45:03.620 align:start position:0%
drives
 
05:45:06.770 --> 05:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
that keep up with the times and I think
 
05:45:08.750 --> 05:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is a really good first step
 
05:45:11.110 --> 05:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
towards modernizing
 
05:45:15.470 --> 05:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
how organizing takes place thank you
 
05:45:17.330 --> 05:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
05:45:17.340 --> 05:45:20.150 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
questions

05:45:20.150 --> 05:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:23.330 --> 05:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again
 
05:45:25.930 --> 05:45:25.940 align:start position:0%
next I would call David Juve
 
05:45:28.850 --> 05:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
representing the Bia he is going to
 
05:45:31.190 --> 05:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill and he needs to speak
 
05:45:35.208 --> 05:45:35.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:37.010 --> 05:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:45:38.570 --> 05:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
committee again for the record my name
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
is David Juve I'm a senior vice
 
05:45:42.590 --> 05:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
president for public policy with the
 
05:45:45.708 --> 05:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association we do
 
05:45:47.750 --> 05:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill I think there are
 
05:45:52.430 --> 05:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
several problems with it one is that I
 
05:45:54.788 --> 05:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
think this is attempting to regulate
 
05:45:57.350 --> 05:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
employer Behavior at the state level
 
05:45:59.410 --> 05:45:59.420 align:start position:0%
that is already
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
addressed by the National Labor
 
05:46:05.570 --> 05:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:09.110 --> 05:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
guides both employers and labor
 
05:46:11.208 --> 05:46:11.218 align:start position:0%
organizers on what they can and cannot
 
05:46:15.288 --> 05:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
do relating to organization so I think
 
05:46:17.270 --> 05:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
this would be if it were passed it would
 
05:46:19.548 --> 05:46:19.558 align:start position:0%
be preempted by federal law
 
05:46:22.190 --> 05:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
secondly I think it is
 
05:46:26.090 --> 05:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
dancing around the issue of free speech
 
05:46:29.288 --> 05:46:29.298 align:start position:0%
I understand that this is relating to
 
05:46:32.770 --> 05:46:32.780 align:start position:0%
requiring an employee to view a video
 
05:46:34.970 --> 05:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
but it uh
 
05:46:37.670 --> 05:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
at least is tangentially related to free
 
05:46:39.470 --> 05:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
speech and I can almost guarantee it
 
05:46:43.010 --> 05:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
would result in in litigation under
 
05:46:45.708 --> 05:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
um First Amendment Free Speech rights
 
05:46:48.048 --> 05:46:48.058 align:start position:0%
and then finally I just want to point
 
05:46:51.170 --> 05:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
out that the fine of ten thousand
 
05:46:54.770 --> 05:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
dollars per employee seems excessive if
 
05:46:56.750 --> 05:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
you're a company and you have a hundred
 
05:46:58.788 --> 05:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
employees which is not a large Company
 
05:47:01.548 --> 05:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
by any stretch of the imagination
 
05:47:03.590 --> 05:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Labor and
 
05:47:08.090 --> 05:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
enforcing this new law found you
 
05:47:10.368 --> 05:47:10.378 align:start position:0%
out of compliance that's a million
 
05:47:12.110 --> 05:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
dollar fine
 
05:47:14.570 --> 05:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
if you have a if you're a larger company
 
05:47:18.170 --> 05:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
say 5 000 which is not unheard of in New
 
05:47:20.510 --> 05:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's a 50 million dollar
 
05:47:24.048 --> 05:47:24.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:27.048 --> 05:47:27.058 align:start position:0%
seems a little excessive so that
 
05:47:28.670 --> 05:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony I'd be happy to
 
05:47:30.948 --> 05:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
try and answer any questions thank you
 
05:47:32.350 --> 05:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
very much are the questions
 
05:47:36.288 --> 05:47:36.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:38.350 --> 05:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Mission
 
05:47:41.030 --> 05:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
duvet sorry
 
05:47:44.810 --> 05:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
um could you Enlighten us as to how the
 
05:47:47.690 --> 05:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
um uh the uh
 
05:47:47.700 --> 05:47:50.690 align:start position:0%
um uh the uh
nlrb

05:47:50.690 --> 05:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
nlrb
 
05:47:54.288 --> 05:47:54.298 align:start position:0%
um addresses these types of meetings
 
05:47:58.310 --> 05:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
the National Labor Relations Act I
 
05:48:01.490 --> 05:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
can't spell out in detail what the
 
05:48:03.230 --> 05:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
provisions are but I could certainly
 
05:48:07.610 --> 05:48:07.620 align:start position:0%
provide that to you that'd be great
 
05:48:10.070 --> 05:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie yes
 
05:48:12.048 --> 05:48:12.058 align:start position:0%
I got it
 
05:48:14.330 --> 05:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:48:16.128 --> 05:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
I have particular interests in what you
 
05:48:19.548 --> 05:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
said about the question of free speech
 
05:48:22.430 --> 05:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
um and if you mean by free speech that
 
05:48:25.548 --> 05:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
employer can lock somebody in a room
 
05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
while they're working and basically
 
05:48:31.610 --> 05:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
require them to listen to to tapes or
 
05:48:33.890 --> 05:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
presentations by people do you consider
 
05:48:35.930 --> 05:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
that to be free speech
 
05:48:38.390 --> 05:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
I consider it
 
05:48:40.368 --> 05:48:40.378 align:start position:0%
um enough of a gray area that it would
 
05:48:43.368 --> 05:48:43.378 align:start position:0%
likely result in litigation
 
05:48:43.378 --> 05:48:47.208 align:start position:0%
likely result in litigation
follow-up

05:48:47.208 --> 05:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:49.448 --> 05:48:49.458 align:start position:0%
why would that be
 
05:48:52.850 --> 05:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
because you're impacting the ability of
 
05:48:55.610 --> 05:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
an employer to pass on information that
 
05:48:58.128 --> 05:48:58.138 align:start position:0%
they deem necessary or important
 
05:49:01.850 --> 05:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
important to the employee and I guess
 
05:49:04.490 --> 05:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
in some ways I I understand how you
 
05:49:07.850 --> 05:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
phrased your question but I really doubt
 
05:49:09.708 --> 05:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
that the rooms are actually being locked
 
05:49:14.090 --> 05:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
and I further would note that this bill
 
05:49:16.670 --> 05:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
refers to anti-union training I don't
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
know of any anti-union training it could
 
05:49:21.530 --> 05:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
have just as easily been called an
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
education session
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:31.250 --> 05:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:49:33.830 --> 05:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question when we
 
05:49:36.890 --> 05:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
talk about free speech and the employer
 
05:49:38.690 --> 05:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
has a captive audience and they won't
 
05:49:40.070 --> 05:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
let them leave
 
05:49:42.170 --> 05:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
Wouldn't It Be Free Speech to allow the
 
05:49:45.048 --> 05:49:45.058 align:start position:0%
other side equal time to give their
 
05:49:45.058 --> 05:49:46.250 align:start position:0%
other side equal time to give their
point

05:49:46.250 --> 05:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:49:48.288 --> 05:49:48.298 align:start position:0%
again I think the National Labor
 
05:49:50.510 --> 05:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
Relations Act stipulates how the other
 
05:49:53.030 --> 05:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
side has the ability to contact and
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
communicate with employees that they're
 
05:49:57.830 --> 05:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
trying to organize
 
05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any requirement
 
05:50:02.030 --> 05:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
that the employer invite them into the
 
05:50:02.040 --> 05:50:04.970 align:start position:0%
that the employer invite them into the
workplace

05:50:04.970 --> 05:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:08.510 --> 05:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you Mr chairman
 
05:50:08.520 --> 05:50:09.230 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you Mr chairman
um

05:50:09.230 --> 05:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:11.330 --> 05:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
but don't you think they should be
 
05:50:14.690 --> 05:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
required to offer the same amount of
 
05:50:18.230 --> 05:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
time and let the employees come at their
 
05:50:19.788 --> 05:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
will if they don't want to hear it they
 
05:50:21.948 --> 05:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
don't have to but at least offer the
 
05:50:24.770 --> 05:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
same amount of time on an issue
 
05:50:27.650 --> 05:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
no I don't think that
 
05:50:32.510 --> 05:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:34.250 --> 05:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:50:36.230 --> 05:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
um are there any laws against uh
 
05:50:38.930 --> 05:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
trainings generally or uh any of these
 
05:50:40.910 --> 05:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
quote unquote four-store coerced
 
05:50:43.190 --> 05:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
trainings uh in other topics that you're
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:49.970 --> 05:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of that you some of
 
05:50:51.890 --> 05:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
you who have been around here for more
 
05:50:53.750 --> 05:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
than two years might remember there was
 
05:50:58.070 --> 05:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
a proposal two years ago that initially
 
05:51:01.250 --> 05:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
impacted private sector employers that
 
05:51:04.690 --> 05:51:04.700 align:start position:0%
stipulated they would be prevented from
 
05:51:07.250 --> 05:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
conducting training programs on
 
05:51:08.948 --> 05:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
diversity and Equity
 
05:51:12.048 --> 05:51:12.058 align:start position:0%
that language was eventually changed
 
05:51:15.530 --> 05:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
although components of that exist in for
 
05:51:19.128 --> 05:51:19.138 align:start position:0%
education for example that's the only
 
05:51:22.548 --> 05:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
thing I can think of
 
05:51:24.170 --> 05:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:51:27.548 --> 05:51:27.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:30.410 --> 05:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:51:31.970 --> 05:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
so you have an issue with the language
 
05:51:35.030 --> 05:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
that says no employer shall require an
 
05:51:38.030 --> 05:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
employee to attend or participate
 
05:51:41.150 --> 05:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
you have an issue with that
 
05:51:43.310 --> 05:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
only to the extent that if the National
 
05:51:46.430 --> 05:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
Labor Relations Act allows employers to
 
05:51:49.128 --> 05:51:49.138 align:start position:0%
require then yes I would have an issue
 
05:51:54.410 --> 05:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:56.930 --> 05:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
all set yeah I think so for now any
 
05:51:59.170 --> 05:51:59.180 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:52:02.448 --> 05:52:02.458 align:start position:0%
uh just for the record I think that
 
05:52:03.890 --> 05:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction between the
 
05:52:05.810 --> 05:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
National Labor Relations Board and the
 
05:52:07.490 --> 05:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
law that governs public employees in the
 
05:52:08.930 --> 05:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and they're not
 
05:52:10.368 --> 05:52:10.378 align:start position:0%
covered by the National Labor Relations
 
05:52:10.378 --> 05:52:11.448 align:start position:0%
covered by the National Labor Relations
Board

05:52:11.448 --> 05:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
Board
 
05:52:14.510 --> 05:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
so you're speaking just yeah yeah thanks
 
05:52:16.490 --> 05:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent clarification and I
 
05:52:18.230 --> 05:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I'm speaking on behalf of
 
05:52:21.948 --> 05:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
05:52:26.750 --> 05:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony

can we we can loop back later if you'd

05:52:47.330 --> 05:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:49.850 --> 05:52:49.860 align:start position:0%

05:52:55.128 --> 05:52:55.138 align:start position:0%

a union member twice two different
experience

05:53:36.368 --> 05:53:36.378 align:start position:0%
experience
 
05:53:40.730 --> 05:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
I I was a union member as an organizer I
 
05:53:43.548 --> 05:53:43.558 align:start position:0%
I've been a community organizer a couple
 
05:53:45.490 --> 05:53:45.500 align:start position:0%
of times
 
05:53:48.650 --> 05:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
and my last experience is an organizer
 
05:53:54.110 --> 05:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:56.650 --> 05:53:56.660 align:start position:0%
my co-workers
 
05:54:00.350 --> 05:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
voted for me to represent them
 
05:54:02.628 --> 05:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
I do have an issue when
 
05:54:02.638 --> 05:54:03.530 align:start position:0%
I do have an issue when
um

05:54:03.530 --> 05:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:05.448 --> 05:54:05.458 align:start position:0%
you employee
 
05:54:10.070 --> 05:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
has um someone from management
 
05:54:13.310 --> 05:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
come to the meeting where only employees
 
05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to be and make a decision
 
05:54:19.810 --> 05:54:19.820 align:start position:0%
where ours as an organizers should be
 
05:54:24.530 --> 05:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
impacted by the decisions in our meeting
 
05:54:27.048 --> 05:54:27.058 align:start position:0%
come to find out that this person who is
 
05:54:29.330 --> 05:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
coming into our meeting in bringing all
 
05:54:34.270 --> 05:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
and these other persons make the
 
05:54:40.010 --> 05:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
decision to sign a contract without us
 
05:54:43.190 --> 05:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
taking final the final conversations and
 
05:54:46.310 --> 05:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
decisions before we sign the contract
 
05:54:49.310 --> 05:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
that affect a lot of the employees who
 
05:54:51.830 --> 05:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
were temporary employees or contractor
 
05:54:51.840 --> 05:54:54.048 align:start position:0%
were temporary employees or contractor
employees

05:54:54.048 --> 05:54:54.058 align:start position:0%
employees
 
05:54:56.750 --> 05:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to support this bill
 
05:55:01.128 --> 05:55:01.138 align:start position:0%
because I believe that employees
 
05:55:01.138 --> 05:55:02.868 align:start position:0%
because I believe that employees
should

05:55:02.868 --> 05:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
should
 
05:55:05.570 --> 05:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to be able to be
 
05:55:09.948 --> 05:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
part of a union without the employer
 
05:55:13.548 --> 05:55:13.558 align:start position:0%
have someone in in and at the beginning
 
05:55:16.070 --> 05:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
when we get higher like someone else
 
05:55:17.930 --> 05:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
said it previously
 
05:55:20.570 --> 05:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
we get to sit down in a room
 
05:55:23.810 --> 05:55:23.820 align:start position:0%
and they told us how bad is to be part
 
05:55:25.368 --> 05:55:25.378 align:start position:0%
of the Union
 
05:55:27.470 --> 05:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
they told us the bad things about being
 
05:55:29.570 --> 05:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
a union member
 
05:55:31.730 --> 05:55:31.740 align:start position:0%
but they should allowed the union to
 
05:55:34.850 --> 05:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
come in and talk to all all of us even
 
05:55:37.610 --> 05:55:37.620 align:start position:0%
then so they can understand you know
 
05:55:40.250 --> 05:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
they even they have rights is it
 
05:55:43.070 --> 05:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
managers because it's two different four
 
05:55:46.010 --> 05:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
union members it can be one group for
 
05:55:48.670 --> 05:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
the organization can be just management
 
05:55:52.850 --> 05:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
and is one group is employees
 
05:55:55.430 --> 05:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
but sometimes people may misunderstand
 
05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
or get confused
 
05:56:00.288 --> 05:56:00.298 align:start position:0%
and you know in some time from try to
 
05:56:02.330 --> 05:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
hurt employees they hurt themselves as
 
05:56:02.340 --> 05:56:03.048 align:start position:0%
hurt employees they hurt themselves as
well

05:56:03.048 --> 05:56:03.058 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:56:05.030 --> 05:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking you to support this bill
 
05:56:07.548 --> 05:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
because it is time for us to recognize
 
05:56:10.070 --> 05:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
that Union's been here for longer longer
 
05:56:10.080 --> 05:56:10.910 align:start position:0%
that Union's been here for longer longer
time

05:56:10.910 --> 05:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:56:12.830 --> 05:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing wrong to being a
 
05:56:15.410 --> 05:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
union member and I'm proud to continue
 
05:56:17.628 --> 05:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
to support unions thank you so much for
 
05:56:19.070 --> 05:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
your time
 
05:56:23.150 --> 05:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:26.030 --> 05:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again and that was
 
05:56:29.330 --> 05:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
the final card that I had
 
05:56:29.340 --> 05:56:30.048 align:start position:0%

um

05:56:30.048 --> 05:56:30.058 align:start position:0%
