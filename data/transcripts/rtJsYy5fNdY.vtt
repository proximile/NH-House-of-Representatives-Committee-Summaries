international Holocaust day
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
and reflecting on that awful genocide
 
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
which occurred in World War II
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
um where we had over 6 million Jews
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
slaughtered and awful and also reflect
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
on genocide that's currently occurring
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
in this world it's it's replicated in
 
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
many continents right now so let's all
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
stand take a moment of silence and try
 
00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
once again this is a good reason for us
 
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
having that in our adequacy formula as
 
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
one of the substantial criteria in which
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
we study in our schools on the social
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
studies Etc Holocaust and genocide is
 
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
mentioned so that's a good thing that we
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
do and hopefully our schools are
 
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
remembering the same today
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
so going on with today I want to
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
announce to the committee that on
 
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
Tuesday we do have some bills which
 
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
we've noted we have a work session on I
 
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 align:start position:0%

that work session dealing with those
 
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 align:start position:0%

the title of House Bill 572 is relative
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
to the eligibility for free School meals
 
00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:53.699 align:start position:0%
this bill is a product of a great deal
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
of interim study work a committee on
 
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
which I served with my fellow colleagues
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
Representatives Ford Ellison Lucas and
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
Woodcock and which was led passionately
 
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
by The Honorable Sue Mullen who will be
 
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
testifying today these meetings included
 
00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:10.039 align:start position:0%
discussions on universal food bills
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
three-tiered systems of free and reduced
 
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
lunch and ones with a single eligibility
 
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
cap approach which this bill today
 
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
represents the intent of this bill is
 
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
twofold one to help support low to
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
Middle income families by raising the
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
eligibility cap for free School meals to
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
300 percent of poverty and as
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
importantly two to cast the broader net
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
beyond the federal guidelines to capture
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
more students and to ensure that as many
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
as possible receive at least one
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
preferably two nutritious meals per day
 
00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:44.459 align:start position:0%
with the additional cost paid for by the
 
00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:45.650 align:start position:0%
with the additional cost paid for by the
state

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
food is one of the basic necessities of
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
life and food insecurity puts tremendous
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
stress on families
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
it only takes a trip to the grocery
 
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
store to know that food price inflation
 
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
is increasing significantly families are
 
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
feeling the strain of those increases as
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
well as the cost of gas housing and
 
00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:03.889 align:start position:0%
well as the cost of gas housing and
utilities

00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
in preparing for this bill I researched
 
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
the 2023 federal poverty guidelines for
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
different sized households and how much
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
districts actually charge for School
 
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.670 align:start position:0%
districts actually charge for School
meals

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
meals
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
with the eligibility cap set at 300
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
percent a family of four would be
 
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
eligible if their income was no more
 
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
than ninety thousand dollars
 
00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
as for the cost of meals hopkinton's
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
website indicates it charges nothing for
 
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
student meals involved where I live and
 
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
talk for 32 years breakfast cost two
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
dollars and lunch costs three dollars I
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
found the same lunch prices in the
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
goldfin schools in the North country
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
which I and my 13 siblings attended
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
I remember the elementary school
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
cafeteria lady saying to me one day as I
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
handed her my 25 cents
 
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
I just don't understand why your parents
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
don't apply for free and reduced lunch
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
imagine saying that to an 18 year old
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old today
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
as a side note I found it interesting
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
that today 60 years later my parents
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
with a household of 16 two kids in
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
college nine in public schools and three
 
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
babies at home would be considered
 
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
living at a level of poverty if they had
 
00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:11.459 align:start position:0%
an income of 90 000 per year and they
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
would be paying more than 500 a month
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
for school lunches without assistance
 
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
just a side note the importance of food
 
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
in the child's education is quite
 
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
obvious as we've heard repeatedly on
 
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
this committee School meals played a
 
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
critical role in student health
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
well-being and academic success success
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
a healthy diet can give a child the
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
energy to think work and play
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
we recently heard the associate
 
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
executive director of New Hampshire
 
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
school administrators Association
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
testified that the toughest part of his
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
job as a school superintendent was
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
having to make the decision to cancel
 
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
school knowing that some kids would not
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
get a meal that day
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
when I was seeking co-sponsors for this
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill back in December my first recruit
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
was representative Dr cascadden when I
 
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
shared the intent of the bill and
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
inquired if she would be a co-sponsor
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
she immediately asked well who's going
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
to pay for it
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
at the time I answered I don't know
 
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
where is that money going to come from
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
the general fund the education trust
 
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
fund some other source of Revenue I
 
00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:14.339 align:start position:0%
still don't know exactly but in
 
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
searching for answers I'm reminded of
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
what representative Miler shared with us
 
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
at the beginning beginning of this
 
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.630 align:start position:0%
at the beginning beginning of this
session

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
we need to understand that our job on
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
the education committee is to create
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
policy which meets the educational needs
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
of students and to let Finance decide if
 
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
and how it will be funded and that's why
 
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'm here today introducing this bill on
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
feeding hungry kids
 
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:38.459 align:start position:0%
you will see on the fiscal note which um
 
00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
the doe will speak to after me
 
00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:44.339 align:start position:0%
information provided by the DOA doe
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
indicates that all costs are
 
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
indeterminable at this time
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
as I stated earlier the intent of this
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
bill is for the state to cover the cost
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
associated with the increase in the cap
 
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
as well as Staffing and administration
 
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
of the program to develop a new process
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
for eligibility determinations
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
offering free lunches for all students
 
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
regardless of income as well as the case
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic would be ideal our
 
00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
existing system of having three
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
categories of pricing results in
 
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:13.700 align:start position:0%
burdensome application processes
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
oftentimes stigmatizes students who
 
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
receive free or reduced meals and can
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
cause families to carry lunch death
 
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
some states have taken their own action
 
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
and have passed Universal meals
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
legislation others have legislation
 
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
pending in state houses
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support HB 572 which the
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
directs the state to provide funding to
 
00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:35.579 align:start position:0%
pay the difference between the federal
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
requirement for a free reduced breakfast
 
00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
and or lunch and the full price for each
 
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
meal at no cost to students who fall
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
under the 300 eligibility cap
 
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
I trust that we can all agree that no
 
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
student should regularly go to school
 
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
hungry and HP 572 is a good first step
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
to help solve this problem
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
I understand that it might be a
 
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
challenge for the doe to work it all out
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
but I would argue that a far greater
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
challenge is on the hungry children
 
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
and with that I will take any questions
 
00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:03.899 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Sue Mullen has assured me
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
that she is at the ready to answer any
 
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
questions you might have so feel free to
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
wait to ask her those questions and
 
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
there are others behind me as well thank
 
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.370 align:start position:0%
there are others behind me as well thank
you

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
oh that's a good one yeah right I mean
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
Sue monster ejection button right boom
 
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
that's right she said I have your back
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions for
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative Hall
 
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
yes your question representative
 
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
cardelli thank you thank you
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative Paul
 
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
um uh you said that this bill was a
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
first step what's the second step
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
Universal would be the second step but
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
there are other there could be steps in
 
00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:42.779 align:start position:0%
between as well I don't know amendments
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
I you know
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
I have a question is the first step
 
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
really that we get the Medicaid direct
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
Bill satisfied yes and then move into
 
00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:56.459 align:start position:0%
this type of uh
 
00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be a good thing yeah
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent Belcher oh I was hoping
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that
 
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
um you brought up a couple very
 
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
important points you brought up costs
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
but I I don't want to talk about costs I
 
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
want to ask about nutrition
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
um obviously this is a very important
 
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.090 align:start position:0%
um obviously this is a very important
issue

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:25.100 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
uh we've heard testimony in the last
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
week for multiple students attending
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
various schools in the state that their
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
food options are according to them quite
 
00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:38.389 align:start position:0%
food options are according to them quite
bad

00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
bad
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
um recently there's been investigative
 
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:42.740 align:start position:0%
journalism looking at the USDA
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines that shows some schools are
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing meals that are actually
 
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
skipped over from fast food places
 
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
because they're not up to their
 
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
standards and we have a child obesity
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
crisis so what assurances do we have
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
that children are actually receiving
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
nutritious meals
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
well a good start would be the farm to
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
school bill right I mean I mean I I mean
 
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
I can't assure anything but
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
um I totally agree the nutritious meals
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
need to be offered
 
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.509 align:start position:0%
need to be offered
um

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
as much as I grew up in a poor family
 
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say hindsight I didn't know
 
00:15:17.569 --> 00:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
it at the time but living on a farm
 
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
hindsight I was the best dead kid in
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
town uh you know but I didn't realize
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
that until I was an adult and I was like
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
wow like there were no potato chips and
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:39.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
I know so you understand that speaker is
 
00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:44.509 align:start position:0%
I know so you understand that speaker is
terrible

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
terrible
 
00:15:44.519 --> 00:15:45.230 align:start position:0%
terrible
um

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
you had said you were hoping you were
 
00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:50.779 align:start position:0%
your intent is that the state will pay
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
that but I don't see that actually in
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
your bill as written and as written I'm
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
afraid that the school districts are
 
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
going to feel that they have to take on
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
do you have are you willing to do an
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that makes that clear
 
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:14.459 align:start position:0%
absolutely I would expect that um there
 
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
will be an amendment thank you
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
further questions not seeing any thank
 
00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
you very much oh my gosh
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you chairman Ladd
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
for your welcome
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
I would thank representative hall for
 
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
involving me this morning but I'm not so
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
that's about you're exactly right uh
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
good morning last week I testified
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
before you and offered general
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
information from the study committee on
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 1229 which met last session
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
to consider School meals
 
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
today I would like to address
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative Hall's proposal to alter
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
the eligibility threshold for free and
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
reduced meals from the federal guideline
 
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
of 185 percent of poverty level to 300
 
00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.690 align:start position:0%
of 185 percent of poverty level to 300
percent

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
for those of you that are not familiar
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
with those guidelines uh there are
 
00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
there's paperwork coming at you that has
 
00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
the various levels per
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
number of family members and you should
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
be receiving that soon
 
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent of this bill is
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
to widen the safety net that we are
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
using to support hungry kids
 
00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
during our study committee time we heard
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
from constituents who expressed concern
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
that families who did not meet the
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements were in fact
 
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
struggling to feed Folks at home
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
these are families who earned more than
 
00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:12.539 align:start position:0%
185 percent of the poverty guidelines
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
but not enough to meet the soaring costs
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
of things like housing and other
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
Associated fees of raising a family
 
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own we have
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
students who eat the bulk of their meals
 
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
at school and this bill supposes that we
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to reach more of
 
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.990 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to reach more of
them

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
our current statute RSA 189 11a
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
already authorizes the State Board of
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
Education to establish the eligibility
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
criteria that is different from the
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
federal government it reads
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education shall
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance with this section and
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
shall establish minimum nutritional
 
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.110 align:start position:0%
shall establish minimum nutritional
standards

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
for each meal as well as income
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines set for the family size used
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
in determining eligibility for free and
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
reduced price meals
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
so in the spirit of trying to think
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
outside the box
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 572 proposes to raise the
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
threshold to 300 percent of the federal
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
poverty level
 
00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
I have provided you with a copy of those
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines as I mentioned
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
the committee recognized that this would
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
represent a considerable amount of
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
effort on the part of the state board
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Education as rules
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
and procedures would need to be
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
developed regarding the application
 
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
process the allocation of funds and how
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
to interface these new New Hampshire
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
standards with current federal standards
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
that require a federal free and reduced
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
amount of data for dollars
 
00:19:57.169 --> 00:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
the financial note on this on this bill
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledges some of that but the actual
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
cost of the program remains
 
00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:03.470 align:start position:0%
cost of the program remains
indeterminable

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
in the past that has meant the kiss of
 
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:06.830 align:start position:0%
in the past that has meant the kiss of
death

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
death
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
the can't instead of the can but I am
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
quite certain that with due diligence a
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
ballpark figure can and should be
 
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.310 align:start position:0%
ballpark figure can and should be
determined

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
determined
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
I am asking the committee to consider
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
the need the effective date the
 
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
necessary funding and the steps we need
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
to take to make childhood hunger a
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
non-issue in New Hampshire
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
other states have initiated uh measures
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
ranging from paying for new meals
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
program staff to providing lunches for
 
00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:39.539 align:start position:0%
everyone I have included the link to the
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
most recent information from the food
 
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
resource and action center Below in the
 
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
copy of my statements that you have
 
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
it's easy to do something because we
 
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
have done almost nothing to expand the
 
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to feed our hungry kids
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
as I said last week it's time to shift
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
our Paradigm away from what we can't do
 
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
to what we can do it's a
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
well-established fact that hunger
 
00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:06.539 align:start position:0%
negatively impacts learning I'm hopeful
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
that we will be able to demonstrate our
 
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
learning by extending a hand up to our
 
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
most precious resources I thank you for
 
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
listening to me and ask that you support
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
House Bill 572 and uh with trepidation I
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
will take questions thank you very much
 
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee yes
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:30.110 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
chair

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to speak briefly or
 
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
question the um the issue of nutrition
 
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
again because it does in fact in the
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
bill say that the State Board of
 
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
Education shall ensure compliance and
 
00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:42.299 align:start position:0%
she'll establish minimum nutritional
 
00:21:42.299 --> 00:21:43.370 align:start position:0%
she'll establish minimum nutritional
standards

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
and I love that however is it not a bit
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
misleading because if we accept federal
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
dollars in this program USDA program are
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
we not effectively seeding our state
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
authority to the federal government and
 
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
are we not forced to accept the USDA
 
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
guidelines for nutrition
 
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.630 align:start position:0%
guidelines for nutrition
um

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
question representative Belcher uh no
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
one has probably mentioned to you that I
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
am not an attorney
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
though they would like to put me in a
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
variety of different roles I I can't
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
answer to the legality and that cocked
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
eyebrow at you I want to clarify was
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
because I was joining with you on the
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
idea that the State Board of Education
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
has the authority to set those
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
nutritious standards okay thank you
 
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative Damon are Damon do you
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
have your hand up earlier
 
00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:36.299 align:start position:0%
oh well you're good you're gonna test
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
that represent uh Tanner
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for coming this
 
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.250 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for coming this
morning

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
um those standards
 
00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
are minimum standards is that correct
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
the the nutritional standards so uh any
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
school or
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
um any vendor that's hired by the school
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
to provide lunches can go above those
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
minimum standards most definitely those
 
00:23:05.409 --> 00:23:05.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
I already asked one
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
um I've got a question for you yes
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
during the past year or so we had all
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
children due to the pandemic receiving
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
meals were do you know of any
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
information that might be available
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
saying that even though they were
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
offered a school meal a family or
 
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
families chose to provide their own
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
meals in other words during that did
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
everybody just start joining on or were
 
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
there some that maybe stayed out I don't
 
00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:36.059 align:start position:0%
have the numbers on that uh Kelly Rambo
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
from the doe is is behind behind me
 
00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:42.059 align:start position:0%
um I think the closest we could come to
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
that would be the total number of
 
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
students enrolled and the total number
 
00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:48.260 align:start position:0%
of meals served
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
so I would ask her for the data on that
 
00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.090 align:start position:0%
so I would ask her for the data on that
representative

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
um but I think that that's yeah thank
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just a real brief
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up on the on the uh question that
 
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
these are minimum standards from the
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
USDA that we could theoretically exceed
 
00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:12.419 align:start position:0%
uh from the state can you walk me
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
through if the USDA guidelines mandate
 
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
say 50 of calories come from
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
carbohydrates and no more than 10 come
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
from fats what would it look like for us
 
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
to exceed those standards
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
first of all the state of New Hampshire
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
already exceeds Federal standards in
 
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
many areas special education being one
 
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
of them so I would refer to that as an
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
example of of a case in which New
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually does better by its
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
students than the federal minimum
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
I I would think that exceeding the
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
federal standards would have to do with
 
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh you know lower salt
 
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
perhaps making sure those carbohydrates
 
00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
are complex carbohydrates uh it would be
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
the definition I I would think of what
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
the minimum indicates and then making
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
the meals healthier than that or adding
 
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
things to
 
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
so maybe monitoring
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
um the quality of dairy products the
 
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
amount of sugar in individual things you
 
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
know increasing some lowering others
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
Nancy Vaughn from the American Heart
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
Association is also in the audience
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
today and she actually is somebody who
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
is much more knowledgeable about the
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
specifics of the USDA regulations so I
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to direct that
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
question to her when she when she's at
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
the moment thank you yeah
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of honorable
 
00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:45.470 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of honorable
sumon

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
sumon
 
00:25:48.289 --> 00:25:48.299 align:start position:0%
yes representative cascadden thank you
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.529 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
Mullen

00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539 align:start position:0%
Mullen
 
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
um I know you worked on this committee a
 
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
whole year I believe right in trying to
 
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
raise that threshold right well we uh
 
00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:00.539 align:start position:0%
the study committee actually convened
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
after the end of the session so it was
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
through the summer and fall okay and I
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
my question is and I don't know if you
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
have the this answer or maybe some
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
somebody else does
 
00:26:12.649 --> 00:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
um but the car seat Institute had
 
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
conducted a significant study on food
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
insecurity among families and children
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
in the state I don't know if you're
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with that maybe still on their
 
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
website but I can't remember what that
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
percentage was other than I know koas
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
County was up the roof I mean kids were
 
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
just struggling for for food and I think
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
that would be a great data point
 
00:26:36.299 --> 00:26:37.010 align:start position:0%
that would be a great data point
um

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure whether or not new
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
Hunger New Hampshire hunger Solutions is
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
with us this morning but they were a
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
pivotal point of information for us in
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
sort of uh digging deeper into into New
 
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:54.539 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we were more looking at the
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
issue more globally representative than
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
than Target specific but that would
 
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
certainly be something that uh would be
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to look at in the future yeah
 
00:27:06.649 --> 00:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
County County if that can be found thank
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
you further questions not seeing you
 
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
lad just
 
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
um one one final thing to say to you
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
before uh I I leave this microphone I
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
wish I could tell you this would be the
 
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
last time that you'll see me this year
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
but it probably won't be but um I I just
 
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate for the committee
 
00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:27.419 align:start position:0%
again that hunger childhood hunger in
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not neither a Democrat
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
nor a republican issue it is a
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan issue that affects children
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
of all all types of and sizes of
 
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:42.539 align:start position:0%
families and I would hope that this
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
represents the type of topic that we can
 
00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:48.419 align:start position:0%
reach across the aisle over and come up
 
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
with some common solution that everybody
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
can live with thank you you're welcome
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask New Hampshire HHS
 
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:46.269 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning representative
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
plaid in the education committee
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to start off today with
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
some facts from New Hampshire hunger
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
Solutions around this bill
 
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
um and then I also have a couple pieces
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
of testimony to share with you
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
um which I've also included in the
 
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
documents that we're passing around
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
um so House Bill 572 aims to increase
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
the income eligibility for free and
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
reduced School meals to 300 percent of
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
the poverty level and eliminate the
 
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
reduced price category for school
 
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
lunches in order to provide more
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
students with access to nutritious food
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
increasing kindergarten through 12th
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
grade student eligibility for free and
 
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
reduced meals to 300 of poverty will
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
ensure that more children have access to
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
the nutrition that they need to reach
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
their full potential
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
and you'll see linked some information
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
from Frac where you can get more
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
information about the studies that have
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
been done on this
 
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:42.830 align:start position:0%
been done on this
um

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:45.059 align:start position:0%
so with that being said Studies have
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
shown that access to nutrition meals
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
nutritious meals improve student health
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
both mental and physical academic
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
performance and overall success reducing
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
poor rates of reducing rates of poor
 
00:29:58.970 --> 00:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
health by at least 29 and rates of
 
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
obesity by at least 17 based on
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
estimates used in National Data
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 572 provides greater
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
stability for those in need allowing
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
them to focus more on their studies and
 
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
less about worrying about where their
 
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
next meal will come will come from and
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
that is something we're hearing from the
 
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
Food Service directors we work with
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
where kids are going to school crying
 
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
because they no longer have access to
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
that free meal their parents either have
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
not been able to complete the form don't
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
know that the form is something they
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
have to complete because of the pandemic
 
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.730 align:start position:0%
have to complete because of the pandemic
waivers

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
um so there's a variety of reasons why
 
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes those forms aren't being
 
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.370 align:start position:0%
sometimes those forms aren't being
completed

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
completed
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
um currently eligibility for free and
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
reduced meals it's set at 130 and 185
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
percent of poverty 130 percent for free
 
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
and 185 percent for reduced
 
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.059 align:start position:0%
leaving a large portion of students who
 
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
are financially vulnerable without
 
00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
access to meals the current median rent
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
for a two-bedroom apartment in New
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is nineteen thousand and eight
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
dollars per year that's the median I'm
 
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
saying that that's pretty generous
 
00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
considering I just moved my
 
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
um newly graduated daughter into her
 
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
first apartment at two thousand dollars
 
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
and working full-time at minimum wage is
 
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand and eighty dollars per
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
year that means that even with two
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
adults working full-time minimum wage
 
00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
jobs they would not make enough to meet
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
the basic needs for their family the
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
living wage for two adults and one child
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is sixty five thousand
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
dollars five sixty five thousand five
 
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy seven dollars and
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
even with two adults working it
 
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
increases to seventy seven thousand one
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
hundred and ninety five dollars due to
 
00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:45.299 align:start position:0%
child care costs the
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
um federal poverty poverty line for a
 
00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:51.059 align:start position:0%
family of three in 2023 is twenty four
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
thousand eight hundred and sixty dollars
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
meaning that three hundred percent of
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
the poverty level would be seventy four
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred and eighty dollars
 
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
and on the third page of what I handed
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
out is the chart that also um
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
represented honorable Mullen handed out
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
um and just to reiterate the cost of
 
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
School meals for one child it's about 90
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
dollars a month but
 
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
um for a family that has more than one
 
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
child that price increases and so for a
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
family with three children it would be
 
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
two hundred and seventy dollars a month
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
and that's on the average price of meals
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
um around the state each school district
 
00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:30.539 align:start position:0%
is just slightly different
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
this legislation would also provide a
 
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
much needed boost to the economy as it
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
would create jobs in the food service
 
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
industry and provide additional support
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
for grocery stores and Farmers we know
 
00:32:42.289 --> 00:32:42.299 align:start position:0%
that for every dollar spent in school
 
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
meals there's a two dollar return on
 
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
investment to the local community and
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
that comes from the Rockefeller
 
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
Foundation as far as where that data
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
point comes from
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
um it would also save staff time effort
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
along Food Service directors to focus on
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
kids nutrition rather than managing
 
00:33:00.649 --> 00:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
different categories of School meals and
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
I can speak to a little bit more of some
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
testimony from a food service director
 
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
in just a second
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
um this bill is in line with the
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
universal School meals laws passed by
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
States like Maine from and Vermont and
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
will help to ensure that students have
 
00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
access to nutritious food regardless of
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
their family's income level and I can
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
attest that through our work with the
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
food research and action center who is
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
their National anti-hunger Advocate that
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
many states around the country are
 
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
passing similar bills to this which
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
um so I want to just take a minute if
 
00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:36.299 align:start position:0%
it's okay to read from one of our food
 
00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
several families ask questions regarding
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
the eligibility guidelines the
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines have not adjusted enough to
 
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
allow for the rates of inflation we're
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
experiencing right now many are asking
 
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
why don't they take into account my
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
expenses my expenses have increased so
 
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
much in the past couple of years but my
 
00:33:57.649 --> 00:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
pay has not increased to meet the
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
demands of my paycheck
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
many families are left in a void that
 
00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult to pay for lunches
 
00:34:06.049 --> 00:34:06.059 align:start position:0%
and making too much to qualify for free
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
and reduced meals our families are
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
struggling due to the increases of
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
utilities and groceries free and reduced
 
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
applications are based on Gross and not
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
met many families are paying for
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
insurance and having mandatory
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
retirement deductions after so many
 
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
hours of work it's a real struggle for
 
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
some families students would rather have
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
a hot lunch than a bag lunch from home
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
it may also be the only hot meal or meal
 
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
they receive in our district we have
 
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
many grandparents as Guardians due to
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
substance use and incarceration their
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
social security income was not designed
 
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
to raise a family on I believe we need
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
to be taking care of our students in our
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
country in order for them to grow and
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
learn it's an investment in the future
 
00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
of our country every child needs
 
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
consistency and Security in their life
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
not food insecurity students were
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
participating in hot nutritional
 
00:34:58.619 --> 00:35:00.470 align:start position:0%
participating in hot nutritional
breakfast

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
breakfast
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
um and now with needing to pay our
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
account has gone down we need to change
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
how this program works to meet the needs
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
of all students and this food service
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
director says thank you for allowing me
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
to have a voice
 
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
from Health and Human for Health and
 
00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
I have a question okay um
 
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that we have families out
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
there which we all know that are dealing
 
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
with a single parent in substance abuse
 
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
an incarceration do you have a handle on
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
where we're going in terms of the
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
statistics on this whether that is
 
00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:41.540 align:start position:0%
increasing from where we have been
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
God is not our expert area of expertise
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
but it is something that school
 
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
districts are seeing that more and more
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
grandparents are raising
 
00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
um children their grandchildren due to
 
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:53.810 align:start position:0%
um children their grandchildren due to
various

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
various
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
um situations we're looking at one
 
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
okay other questions represent Belcher
 
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.870 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
am I am I correct in Remembering did we
 
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
recently have testimony from a high
 
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
school student affiliated with the
 
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
organization on the farm to school bill
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
she was I believe
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
um in representing the um scan
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
organization save the children Action
 
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
Network okay
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
um well if I may
 
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.490 align:start position:0%
um well if I may
um

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:24.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
regardless we heard from that student
 
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
that she testified that the quality of
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
the foods offered in her school were
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
indeed quite bad according to her
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
if if this so there's an incentive
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
structure that creates that situation
 
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:44.099 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to understand does this
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill expanding this program
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
seek to reinforce does that reinforce
 
00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:51.020 align:start position:0%
that incentive structure that leads to
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
these as she testified poor quality
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
foods rather than moving toward better
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
um so as far as nutritional standards
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the schools I will leave that to the
 
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to answer but
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
what I can say is that from our
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
conversations with food service
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
directors many of them are running in
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
school debt right now which means that
 
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
ins because families are unable to pay
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
for the school meals that they have that
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
means that those programs are running in
 
00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
the red
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
um when you think about going to a
 
00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
restaurant because a lot of times the
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
food service programs are separate
 
00:37:33.609 --> 00:37:33.619 align:start position:0%
budgets from the actual School District
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
so those monies have to come from the
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
sale of food if families aren't able to
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
afford to feed their children or their
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
children are eating and not able to pay
 
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:44.339 align:start position:0%
that means that these programs are
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
running in debt there's also been huge
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
increases in the cost of food somebody
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
was just telling me the other day in
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
order to serve a serving of celery and
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
meet the federal standards that it's
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
almost 40 cents for that serving of
 
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
celery per student now if that happens
 
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
to be a lunch price that's 40 cents of
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
three dollars that doesn't give into the
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
other components nor does it give in to
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
the labor costs that are accrued in
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
order to feed that one student
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
um I think that you know nutrition
 
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
standards are very important and even
 
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
with where they are based on the minimum
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines by the federal government the
 
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
numbers that you're seeing that we've
 
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
presented here for
 
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
um improved Health outcomes and improved
 
00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
rates of obesity still stand there's
 
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
still an increase with the federal with
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
where the guidelines are now so an
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
improvement in that would be even better
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
right and so that means it's a minimum
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
and as to the point of Representative
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
health or they can always do better
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you represent luno
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thanks for
 
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:50.099 align:start position:0%
joining us today from from New Hampshire
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
hunger Solutions right thank you and and
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just uh just sort of a follow-on to
 
00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
representative belcher's question when
 
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
it comes to the the you know comments
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
that this committee and others have
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
heard with respect to subjective you
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
know um comments about quality of food
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
um uh I was wondering if you could
 
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
comment a little bit about the like as
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
you were just doing the the objective
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
standard for quality of food and how
 
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
that may relate to
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
um not having a breakfast or lunch at
 
00:39:21.599 --> 00:39:24.410 align:start position:0%
um not having a breakfast or lunch at
all

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
so students not eating because they
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't so let me put in another one okay
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
would it would it uh
 
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
would it be would a student be better
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
off having a meal that meets the the
 
00:39:41.329 --> 00:39:41.339 align:start position:0%
objective standards set by the state or
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
federal government compared to not
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
having a meal at all
 
00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:50.339 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you absolutely thank
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
you further questions
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
oh did you is there another question I
 
00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.870 align:start position:0%
oh did you is there another question I
think

00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
um I missed which piece of data you said
 
00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.490 align:start position:0%
um I missed which piece of data you said
was

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
um you received from the Rockefeller
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
foundation for every dollar spent in
 
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
school meals there's a two dollar return
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
on investment
 
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
and I will just say because we do
 
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
support a lot of breakfast
 
00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:23.339 align:start position:0%
um legislation as well that we know that
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
um we miss about 78. 100 students a day
 
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:29.060 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who are eligible for
 
00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619 align:start position:0%
school breakfast that don't participate
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
so we still have a lot of work to do in
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
promoting School meals
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'd like to invite
 
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Ladd members of
 
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
the education committee
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
um for the record I am Nancy Vaughn
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
government relations director for the
 
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
American Heart Association in New
 
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.329 align:start position:0%
American Heart Association in New
Hampshire

00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:14.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to start off by
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
saying that this committee asks not only
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
great questions but the right questions
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we'll get all of them
 
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
answered if not today as we move forward
 
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm very happy to be here today to
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
testify and support of this bill House
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
Bill 572 the American Heart Association
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
nationally has prioritized our support
 
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.290 align:start position:0%
nationally has prioritized our support
of

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
um of ensuring that every child in new
 
00:41:44.569 --> 00:41:44.579 align:start position:0%
in the country as well as New Hampshire
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
has access to healthy School meals so we
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
do support healthy School meals for all
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
students but this bill does get us
 
00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
closer to closing the gaps that we are
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
seeing and has as people before me have
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
have mentioned of people who are not
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
currently free and reduced eligible
 
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
um families but are still not able to
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
afford either a school meal or bringing
 
00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:11.060 align:start position:0%
lunch in from home
 
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
and so I want to get right to some of
 
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
the questions that were asked that is
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
actually within my written testimony so
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
um representative Belcher had asked a
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
question a few times on the nutrition
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
standards and this is the data point
 
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
that is in my written testimony since
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
um 2012 when the USDA created the latest
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
updates to the guidelines for School
 
00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.670 align:start position:0%
updates to the guidelines for School
meals

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
meals
 
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
um school lunches have become 41
 
00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
healthier and school breakfasts have
 
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
become 44 healthier
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
during the pan well actually before the
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
pandemic back in I think it was 2017 at
 
00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:56.579 align:start position:0%
the federal level Congress began
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
um allowing a little more leeway on the
 
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.250 align:start position:0%
um allowing a little more leeway on the
guidelines

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
um there were meant to be additional
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
improvements to the 2012 guidelines
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
particularly in sodium so to a certain
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
point schools have gotten to the point
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
where they have reached the second level
 
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
of sodium reduction and there are two
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
more levels and unfortunately I didn't
 
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
bring the bill from last year with me or
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
my testimony but I can share that out to
 
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
you afterwards so last year House Bill
 
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
1561 I believe was the number was meant
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
to address the nutrition standards that
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
we were asking the New Hampshire
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to start with
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
those minimum standards at the federal
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
level and pick up where we have left off
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
nationally with the Sodium reductions
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
um the the federal program did not set
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
goals for sugar content and there is
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
science around how much sugar a child
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
should be consuming and to make sure
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
that that is represented in school meals
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
also the whole grain issue I believe
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
schools have met the um the the federal
 
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
guideline on whole grains but I believe
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
that there's another step that we can do
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
that we were looking for last year I am
 
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
not sure about the testimony provided on
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
that particular school district and why
 
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
that person felt that the meals were not
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
as nutritionally adequate but it could
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
be because during the pandemic there was
 
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
also food supply issues and there was a
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
waiver allowed for school districts in
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
every state to step outside of those
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
USDA guidelines for a period of time and
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
we actually am part of our bill from
 
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
last year had asked that the Department
 
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
of Education in New Hampshire look at
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
limiting those waivers and that before a
 
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
set amount of time and that the
 
00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339 align:start position:0%
Department of Education staff on School
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
meals could provide technical assistance
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
as to how schools could get back in line
 
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
with those guidelines but again because
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic that that was a little
 
00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
challenging there were some healthy
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
foods that schools were not able to get
 
00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
because it just wasn't available from
 
00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:10.220 align:start position:0%
The Producers
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
so that was one point I wanted to make
 
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:14.780 align:start position:0%
sure I got across
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
and just in general you know we're here
 
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
because we want we're concerned about
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
the health of students we want all
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
students to grow up to be of a healthy
 
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
weight because if they grow up at a
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
healthy weight they're more likely as
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
adults to remain at that healthy weight
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
and children who eat better do well
 
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
academically more so than their of their
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
peers that are are not eating as
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
nutritious nutritious of a diet and
 
00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
those who who learn who are better
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
academic results or outcomes get better
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
jobs and they can continue with Better
 
00:45:54.849 --> 00:45:54.859 align:start position:0%
Health outcomes as adults
 
00:45:59.050 --> 00:45:59.060 align:start position:0%
children who are who do better in school
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
and can get better jobs these people are
 
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
less likely to use tobacco products as
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
an example as a country we have not done
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
as well as adults even with our healthy
 
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
eating and physical activity so this is
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
something that we're still very focused
 
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
on and I so I think those are my key
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
points again my written testimony please
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
take the time to look at if you would I
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
also agree there need to be some
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
amendments perhaps to this this bill to
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
clarify some things which the sponsor
 
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
had mentioned and also the funding piece
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
I highly recommend that this be funded
 
00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
through the state budget so again that's
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
my testimony I would love to get more
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
information to you on this after this
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and I'm I can take questions and
 
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
hopefully I can answer them if not I
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
will get the answers are there any
 
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.069 align:start position:0%
will get the answers are there any
questions

00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
represent belch we have about two
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
minutes left in this when we still have
 
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
two people to speak
 
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'll be brief uh
 
00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
um glad to see you're here actually Todd
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
ACLS and BLS for the American Heart
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
Association for quite a while
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering if you do you
 
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
know I'll stop your head with the
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines for usdar for percentage of
 
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
um first for school students percentage
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
of uh calories that must come from uh
 
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:19.730 align:start position:0%
of uh calories that must come from uh
carbohydrates

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
um that I am not too sure of
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
um I know you know the whole grains gets
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
to that that point a little bit
 
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
um I can get I'll look that up and get
 
00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
that answer too if someone else by me
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have it if I may real quick I
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
believe it was if I'm not mistaken 50 I
 
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
don't want to it's not 100 but I think
 
00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
it was 50 according to what I read
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
is that a proper amount of carbohydrates
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
for a young person to be receiving who's
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
living perhaps a not particularly sporty
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
lifestyle well again the guidelines that
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
have been set for for youth for children
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
we take that into account so it would be
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
you know for for for healthy Americans
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
is what the dietary guidelines are and
 
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
it could be that for someone who has you
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
know whether they have overweight issues
 
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
um would need to work with a a health
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
care professional to you know make that
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
a little different for them so the
 
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
guidelines aren't really meant to apply
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
to every single person it's just kind of
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
an average over that but um I will look
 
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
that up and get you more information
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much further
 
00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.309 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much further
questions

00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you I'm going to jump
 
00:48:28.089 --> 00:48:28.099 align:start position:0%
right now to the Department of Education
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
and uh we've had several questions
 
00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
referencing nutrition and nutritional
 
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
value of the food served in the program
 
00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:38.150 align:start position:0%
value of the food served in the program
and

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
Kelly if you can please try to address
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
um Kelly Rambo Department of Education
 
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
um sure where shall I start um I just
 
00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.730 align:start position:0%
um sure where shall I start um I just
handed

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
handed
 
00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:56.339 align:start position:0%
um representative Belcher a breakdown of
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
the nutrition requirements I am happy to
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
get a copy of that to you and you can
 
00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:03.380 align:start position:0%
hand that out as well
 
00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
the top portion of that you might not
 
00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:06.970 align:start position:0%
the top portion of that you might not
understand

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:06.980 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
it's very heavy USDA and there's a lot
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
that goes back into that the bottom
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
section does break down the new um the
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
calories the sodium and they are
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
specific to each meal pattern and each
 
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
grade that the USDA comes out so there
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
isn't specific on to your question
 
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
previously on carbohydrates or along
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
those lines calorie specific to that the
 
00:49:35.569 --> 00:49:35.579 align:start position:0%
calories are based on the meal as a
 
00:49:35.579 --> 00:49:37.849 align:start position:0%
calories are based on the meal as a
whole

00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
do you have copies of that I only had
 
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
one um okay that should come around to
 
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:47.099 align:start position:0%
um and um I can get you an electronic
 
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
copy so that you can um pass that up
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh thank you
 
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:54.829 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh thank you
um

00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:56.809 --> 00:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
maybe I missed it but looking at this
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
bill really it does not change anything
 
00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
in in regard to nutritional standards it
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
has to do only with
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
um the household income level for people
 
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
to receive meals am I correct that's
 
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
correct as the bill is written yes
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
okay are there further represent
 
00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.089 align:start position:0%
okay are there further represent

woodcock
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you chair live
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you once again for your work
 
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
this summer as well as guiding us uh are
 
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
you able to answer a question that deals
 
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
with uh nutrition and brain development
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
um I can try but that
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
um would probably be somebody um for the
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
American Heart Association perhaps
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's not correlated with the 300
 
00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:45.380 align:start position:0%
percent that we're talking about here
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
on topic here that we can have we can
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
get that information represented with I
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
don't mean to cut you off but that's
 
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
okay I'll get back to you thank you
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent Balboni
 
00:50:59.450 --> 00:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question could you just
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
remind me of what the federal
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
reimbursement level is right now per
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
school lunch
 
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
sure do you want um so the free is 130
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
and the reduces 138 all right but that's
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise what's the actual dollar
 
00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.089 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise what's the actual dollar
amount

00:51:17.089 --> 00:51:17.099 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
um I can get you the dollar amounts that
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
broken down
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
um I can get you a copy of that okay
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone thank you Mr chair
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you to the committee
 
00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:44.579 align:start position:0%
representative hope Damon Sullivan
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
County District eight nine towns you've
 
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
heard me list
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
I've put my dietitian hat back on
 
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
the number one principle in nutrition is
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
you provide enough energy AKA calories
 
00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:02.099 align:start position:0%
enough food before you pay attention to
 
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
any other aspect of nutrition
 
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
it is a fundamental principle that we
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
have to feed people something
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
before we address
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
what you have a diagnosis that needs a
 
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
particular kind of meal plan to treat it
 
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
or other needs people have to be fed
 
00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.510 align:start position:0%
or other needs people have to be fed
first

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
it's been noted that hunger creates
 
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
cognitive issues I also want to note it
 
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
creates behavioral issues
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
people of any age who have low blood
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
sugar have less emotion regulation get
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
irritable and impulsive much more
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
quickly this is very very well
 
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
documented not only in the community of
 
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
people who have diabetes but also in
 
00:52:47.089 --> 00:52:47.099 align:start position:0%
just ordinary folks like let's say we
 
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
all skipped breakfast and lunch and I
 
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
suspect our tolerance of differing
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
points of view late afternoon would
 
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.790 align:start position:0%
points of view late afternoon would
diminish

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
diminish
 
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
it's just what happens if you're hungry
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
so that's my first point it's a
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle first to be fed
 
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
I don't think the USDA School Lunch
 
00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:08.339 align:start position:0%
standards are perfect I will say that as
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
a a preface however
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
what people observe just from looking at
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
and eating the foods that are served
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
isn't the complete picture because many
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
of the items that are served in school
 
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
lunch are particularly manufactured for
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
the school lunch program
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
so for example chicken nuggets that
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
someone might buy in the freezer case at
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
the grocery store or at a fast food
 
00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:35.030 align:start position:0%
the grocery store or at a fast food
franchise

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
franchise
 
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
are not anything that most people who
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
are invested in good nutrition would
 
00:53:38.819 --> 00:53:40.190 align:start position:0%
are invested in good nutrition would
promote

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
promote
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
chicken nuggets in the school lunch
 
00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:44.839 align:start position:0%
program are more protein whole grain
 
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
unsaturated fat they're made to
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
particular standards that make them
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
be a better quality product than what
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
you would stereotype them to be
 
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
do I think they're perfect no but
 
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
they're not we're underestimating them
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
is what I'm suggesting
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
and there is a balance that school lunch
 
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
people need to achieve between serving
 
00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
healthy quality food and serving food
 
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
that children
 
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
find familiar and willing to eat and
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's true no matter who you're feeding
 
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
so I think that that is a tightrope it
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
is hard if you're coming from a
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
household where you don't have exposure
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
to truly healthy wonderful food
 
00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
there is a learning curve to get used to
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
eating in a say fruit and vegetable lean
 
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
protein-centered way
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
one other piece I'd like to note I don't
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
want to go on too long the cost of
 
00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
School meals is a bargain
 
00:54:47.089 --> 00:54:47.099 align:start position:0%
I would challenge anybody to provide the
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
nutrient value of those meals for the
 
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
same amount of money at home routinely
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's amazing what they pull off
 
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for the
 
00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.150 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for the
representative

00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much and
 
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.049 --> 00:55:09.059 align:start position:0%
the next year in which we're going to
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
move into is HB 625 relative to the
 
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
calculation of average daily membership
 
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:18.359 align:start position:0%

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues for the record uh
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
representative Glenn cordelli
 
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
representing Tuftonboro Wolfeboro and
 
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
Ossipee in the beautiful Lakes Region uh
 
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
HB 625 does just two things
 
00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339 align:start position:0%
first it modifies uh RSA 198 38 uh
 
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.339 align:start position:0%
to indicate it is not just homeschool
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
students who have access to academic
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
courses in their resident Public School
 
00:56:06.599 --> 00:56:08.390 align:start position:0%
courses in their resident Public School
District

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:56:12.849 --> 00:56:12.859 align:start position:0%
um current law in 93 1C
 
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
indicates and I'll quote it from you if
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have your books handy
 
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
non-public public chartered or
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
home-educated pupils shall have access
 
00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
to curricular programs offered by the
 
00:56:26.329 --> 00:56:26.339 align:start position:0%
school district in which the pupil
 
00:56:26.339 --> 00:56:28.270 align:start position:0%
school district in which the pupil
resides

00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
resides
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
non-public and Charter Schools also have
 
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
access to curricular and academic
 
00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:36.170 align:start position:0%
access to curricular and academic
courses

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
courses
 
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
as you'll see in the the bill in the
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
bolded text we have indicated that
 
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:45.890 align:start position:0%
bolded text we have indicated that
um

00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:49.609 --> 00:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
it's crosses out home educated
 
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
and indicates that anyone who is
 
00:56:55.569 --> 00:56:55.579 align:start position:0%
eligible to have access According to
 
00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:00.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:02.339 align:start position:0%
um nothing has changed in regard to
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
school funding here it's bringing our
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
um basically clean up
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
the second thing it does is a in
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
relation to uh high school programs and
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
courses and possible funding
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
in section two of the bill
 
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:27.710 align:start position:0%
in section two of the bill
um

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
online 13 at 12 and 13 you will see that
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
it removes High School
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
and indicates that
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
any academic course in grades 1 through
 
00:57:42.839 --> 00:57:43.750 align:start position:0%
any academic course in grades 1 through
12

00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
12
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
would be available to these students and
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
available reimbursement from uh the
 
00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
state based on the current uh 0.15 per
 
00:57:58.849 --> 00:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
pupil class
 
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
so those are the two things it does it
 
00:58:04.809 --> 00:58:04.819 align:start position:0%
uh aligns our statutes in the first
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
portion and expands access to academic
 
00:58:13.609 --> 00:58:13.619 align:start position:0%
courses Beyond High School to Elementary
 
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
Middle School also
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
and with that I thank you very much
 
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:26.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if this is just
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
clean up language
 
00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh how does it change what what would
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
happen as a result of cleaning up this
 
00:58:33.839 --> 00:58:35.630 align:start position:0%
happen as a result of cleaning up this
language

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.349 align:start position:0%
language
um

00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
um I I think that what changes is in the
 
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
second portion with expanding it Beyond
 
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
just High School
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
um availability to
 
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
um grades one through twelve so that's
 
00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:53.339 align:start position:0%
that's where the major change is
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
um in the program
 
00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up please yes I I still don't
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
understand the cleanup if you clean up
 
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
this language what makes more available
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
who makes more who can have access
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
greater how do you see this changing or
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
who who currently under the current
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
language doesn't have access maybe
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's a better question thank you
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
um in 193
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
it states that
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
non-public public chartered and
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
homeschool students whereas here
 
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
currently in 198 it's limited to home
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:42.049 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:59:42.049 --> 00:59:42.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for taking my
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
question if I'm reading this correctly
 
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
would this result in more funding going
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
to the public schools
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
um if more students from
 
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
non-public public chartered or
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
homeschool students are taking advantage
 
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
of courses available at their local
 
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
school it would because the school would
 
01:00:09.049 --> 01:00:09.059 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed for those additional
 
01:00:09.059 --> 01:00:10.130 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed for those additional
students

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.140 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:11.579 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:13.849 --> 01:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
question if a child is uh
 
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
in an EFA program
 
01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:22.849 align:start position:0%
in an EFA program
and

and
 
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
um they're taking
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
a variety of different

a variety of different
um

01:00:28.609 --> 01:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
ways to gain credit or they're in a
 
01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:35.540 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program a EOL program
 
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
does that mean that this suddenly makes
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
them eligible where they weren't before
 
01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
to take curricular activities and also
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
um as a follow-up on that uh the
 
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities can schools
 
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
still charge for them
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:00:56.329 --> 01:00:56.339 align:start position:0%
um under
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
um the education Freedom account
 
01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.630 align:start position:0%
um the education Freedom account
statutes

01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
um they are eligible to take uh courses
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
um at their local school but they would
 
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
uh pay for that out of their EFA account
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
um the state would not be a
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement they would pay for that
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
out of their account
 
01:01:18.849 --> 01:01:18.859 align:start position:0%
um and the second part of your question
 
01:01:23.089 --> 01:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
yes uh the co-curricular so uh if a
 
01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
homeschool student or
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
um Charter I I don't know the different
 
01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:32.780 align:start position:0%
one EF EFA students do co-curriculars
 
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh such as you know sports or theater or
 
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
whatever is the school allowed they
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
don't get reimbursed for that uh because
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's only for academics uh courses do do
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
can the schools still charge for people
 
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
coming in and participating on those
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
um I I don't recall off the top of my
 
01:01:54.119 --> 01:01:54.950 align:start position:0%
um I I don't recall off the top of my
head

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
head
 
01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
um what the provisions are in the EFA
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%

a school
 
01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:26.180 align:start position:0%

do they also reimburse the school
 
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
for co-curricular activities that these
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
students participate in
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for the question in
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
lines 11 and 12
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
um it indicates curricular and cochlear
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that it says that they can
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
reimburse for academic courses but not
 
01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:02.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
in line five right
 
01:03:05.819 --> 01:03:06.730 align:start position:0%
in line five right
um

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:06.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
0.15 pupil for each
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
um academic course taken in public
 
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
schools but it doesn't mention
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
co-curricular right
 
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
um elsewhere in statute
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
um it defines co-curricular as
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
activities which are designed to
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
supplement enrich academic programs so I
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
that's my reading um the Department of
 
01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:35.339 align:start position:0%
Education behind me might have a
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
different different interpretation
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you
 
01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:42.059 align:start position:0%
um when we wrote uh this legislation
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
here there was a concern that we had
 
01:03:47.410 --> 01:03:47.420 align:start position:0%
coming in from uh the
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
nhia and school districts in regard to
 
01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:53.339 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activity
 
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
and that they want to be assured and I
 
01:03:58.609 --> 01:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
want to be assured does this still
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
enable a school district regardless of
 
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from being a
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
homeschooler EFA student another public
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
school private school etc etc
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
you must comply with the same policy
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
statements that are there for students
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
in that school offering the
 
01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:20.700 align:start position:0%
co-curricular such as Athletics you will
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
have passing academics grades you will
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
not be smoking something or drinking
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
something that's not allowed and that is
 
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:30.839 align:start position:0%
very typical of those rules and
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
regulations are we changing any of that
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
uh no we're not those who would still
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
apply thank you
 
01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.829 align:start position:0%
good morning
um

01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
the the uh definition or uh further
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
explanation of non-public school
 
01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.089 align:start position:0%
explanation of non-public school
students

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh you're talking about non-public
 
01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
school Charter High School King can you
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
explain that for me so clear
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
um in statute and rules
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
um it frequently talks about non-public
 
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
the department approves non-public
 
01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:09.770 align:start position:0%
the department approves non-public
schools

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:12.299 align:start position:0%
um the State Board I should say
 
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
um I understand that but can you define
 
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
what who they are who are non-public
 
01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
schools that that would be applicable to
 
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
this uh inclusion into a curriculum
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
non-curricular schools uh basically uh
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
private schools academies so
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so
 
01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
um a parochial school student a student
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
on eafa going to approach the school
 
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
Under non-public school would be able to
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
allowed to come to a uh public school
 
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
and take a co-curricular activity uh yes
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
I would think so I think if we were to
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
say they couldn't come from a parochial
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
school you would be in court the next
 
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
day based on recent uh Supreme Court
 
01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.589 align:start position:0%
day based on recent uh Supreme Court
decisions

01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
further questions represent parentnell
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
am I understanding this sorry thank you
 
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
Mr chair am I understanding this
 
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
correctly that currently there may be
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
students then who are eligible to
 
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
participate in curricular or
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
co-curricular courses for which the
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
school district might not be receiving
 
01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.930 align:start position:0%
school district might not be receiving
funding

01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
uh the department can go into that but
 
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
um the funding is based on available
 
01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.529 align:start position:0%
um the funding is based on available
funding

01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
so it is currently possible that they
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
might not get reimbursed but it's all
 
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
based on available funding um for the
 
01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:36.109 align:start position:0%
based on available funding um for the
reimbursement

01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
further questions just so by cleaning up
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
this language
 
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
then we might be able to ensure that the
 
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
schools will receive funding for these
 
01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.210 align:start position:0%
schools will receive funding for these
students

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:48.770 align:start position:0%
students
um

01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
I would hope so uh uh the department
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure we'll be glad to answer that
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
question also I think just a little
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
clarification here we through our
 
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
funding formula for Education every
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
school district receives base adequacy
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
and the areas that differentiated Aid
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
it's incumbent upon the individual
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
districts to raise their money for
 
01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities
 
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
that's not part of adequacy
 
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
so locals have to do that that's why
 
01:07:22.609 --> 01:07:22.619 align:start position:0%
many districts have activity fees to
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
participate whether it be intramural or
 
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
you know a competitive activity
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
just to clarify it says let's see right
 
01:07:34.609 --> 01:07:34.619 align:start position:0%
here a student who is enrolled and a
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
school board approved Public School
 
01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:43.849 align:start position:0%
school board approved Public School
academic

01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
apologies do I need to reread that
 
01:07:48.289 --> 01:07:48.299 align:start position:0%
all right let me start here we're on the
 
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
line four regarding student who was
 
01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a school board approved
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
Public School course taken in a public
 
01:07:56.039 --> 01:07:57.109 align:start position:0%
Public School course taken in a public
school

01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:07:59.450 --> 01:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I skipped the line anyway this
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
shall count as a 0.15 student so if I'm
 
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
reading that correctly a student from a
 
01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:06.059 align:start position:0%
private school would have to be enrolled
 
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
in at least one Public School course and
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
that public school is slated to receive
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
funding for this student if they're to
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
participate in these programs is that
 
01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.630 align:start position:0%
participate in these programs is that
correct

01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
remember if you look at that statute it
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
says if the operating budget by the
 
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
state has the money for the 0.15 there's
 
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
no guarantee correct yes I just wanted
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
to clarify that part yes yes thank you
 
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock if thank you and
 
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
the channel That in this I won't ask
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
this one uh on this bill remember the
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
Cardiology uh you responded to
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
representative Miler about cleaning up
 
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at the what seems to be
 
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
a pretty simple change taking High out
 
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
of the word public high school
 
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
um is this not really a cleaning up this
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
is an expansion of raise one through
 
01:09:02.329 --> 01:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
eight students which is a larger body of
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
impact than just cleaning up the word
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
taking High School which was you know
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
obviously nine to twelve would you agree
 
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
with that uh yes
 
01:09:11.809 --> 01:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
um the cleanup was
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
um in relation to part of section one
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
but you're writing also in section one
 
01:09:20.329 --> 01:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
as in section two it changes it from
 
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
public high school to public school it's
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
a huge expansion okay thank you thank
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
you representative and I'm just going to
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
follow up with a question that Keith off
 
01:09:29.329 --> 01:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
of what you just mentioned represent
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
Woodcock and this was discussed when we
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
put the 1.15 uh possible reimbursement
 
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
for High School courses
 
01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:39.299 align:start position:0%
and in the high school there are
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
designated courses one takes in the
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
grade schools there are
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
yeah they're subjects which we teach but
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're they're embedded in many
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
different topics
 
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
so the question is how do we Define what
 
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
the 0.15 is for the grade schools or the
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
elementary schools and Elementary School
 
01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
technically can go right up through the
 
01:10:06.729 --> 01:10:06.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
next question for me
 
01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
oh how how are you going to Define what
 
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
the 0.1 I I I would think that um that
 
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
would be done through rules from the
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
Department I I don't have uh uh a
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
specific answer to you for that
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
question I want to make sure that my
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that we're talking
 
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
about residents of the district
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
and that because they are residents of
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
the district and have paid their taxes
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
towards their local school that is why
 
01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
the students are eligible for the
 
01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.550 align:start position:0%
the students are eligible for the
co-curriculars

01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
co-curriculars
 
01:10:58.729 --> 01:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
which are paid for by the local taxes
 
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
and that was I mean my son did that when
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
he homeschooled and and that was my
 
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
understanding I just want to make sure
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
I've got that right uh Yes actually
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I think it was two years ago there
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
was a uh
 
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
um a court case
 
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
um because
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
um a school in Rochester was done
 
01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:21.020 align:start position:0%
denying access to a homeschool student
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
for a co-curricular activities
 
01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:26.209 align:start position:0%
for a co-curricular activities
questions

01:11:26.209 --> 01:11:26.219 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:32.060 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative lakis was asking about
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
homeschool but does this include
 
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
students who are going to a private
 
01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:39.770 align:start position:0%
students who are going to a private
school

01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
um and then able to go to the public
 
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
school and try out for the basketball
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
team it's maybe even their private
 
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
school actually has their own basketball
 
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:54.649 align:start position:0%
school actually has their own basketball
team

01:11:54.649 --> 01:11:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
um it does say non-non public in there
 
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.290 align:start position:0%
um it does say non-non public in there
um

01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:04.460 align:start position:0%
uh and co-curricular um I guess would
 
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
include the athletic activities
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
um so that's you know something you
 
01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
might want to take a look at as the
 
01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
Committee Member
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
good question
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm not sure if this
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
question is for representative Cordelia
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
or for you will we have a fiscal note on
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
this before we proceed in executive
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
session because as a reference to what
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
working at the Department of Education
 
01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
they're here for technical advice if
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
needed and we may need that technical
 
01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
advice in the past the financial note we
 
01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
we are tasked for looking at the policy
 
01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
side of things
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the financial note sometimes doesn't
 
01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
arrive until this is sitting in the
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
lapse of the fiscal division two uh
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
folks so we would be looking at if we
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
don't have one we'd have to act upon the
 
01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm just reflecting on
 
01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock's question and I
 
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
think yours
 
01:13:14.209 --> 01:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
about the K to eight change that does
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
not appear to me to be only clean up and
 
01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
it seems like that would have
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
considerable fiscal impact depending on
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
how the 0.15 was ruled yeah thank you
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh any further questions thank
 
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
you very much and is there anybody from
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%

be prepared to respond to
 
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
some of the issues which we've just
 
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's Caitlyn's card right there
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%

01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
pink you got your pink card I'm going
 
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record I'm Caitlin
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
Diaz from the Department of Education
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
and I have my co-worker here Brian Eaton
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
who is relatively new to the department
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
and has some data for us
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to give you a base
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of how this current
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
currently works I believe
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
um this provision was put in law around
 
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
2016 and it was originally a proposal
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
that had come from
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
um senators in the Keene area as there
 
01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:18.620 align:start position:0%
were many kids that were accessing
 
01:14:22.729 --> 01:14:22.739 align:start position:0%
curricular activities or coursework at
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
the Keene schools that were homeschooled
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
kids and Keen had said would we would
 
01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
like some adequacy funding for those
 
01:14:29.219 --> 01:14:30.070 align:start position:0%
like some adequacy funding for those
children

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
at that time the law that passed
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
then allowed
 
01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:37.070 align:start position:0%
then allowed
um

01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:39.659 align:start position:0%
kids who were taking courses at the high
 
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
school that were homeschooled to be
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for a reimbursement for 0.15 of
 
01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:48.380 align:start position:0%
the adequacy amount
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
for each academic course that the child
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
is participating in provided that there
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
is State appropriation and adequacy
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
formula so sometimes when the Department
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
of Education doesn't estimate as part of
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
a part of our state biennium budget we
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
have excess funding because when we're
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
doing the state biennium budget we're
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
several years out when we're typically
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
estimating that and so time sometimes
 
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
there's excess appropriation sometimes
 
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
there's not sometimes we need to ask for
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
a warrant for additional funding to be
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
available for us to pay that amount
 
01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
since the amount has been or since this
 
01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
law changed I believe we've paid it
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
around three times with the process is
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
that is is for us is when the school
 
01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.110 align:start position:0%
that is is for us is when the school
district

01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
enters their end of their day data they
 
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
tell us how many home school kids at the
 
01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
high school level participated in an
 
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
academic course we have a definition of
 
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
academic course it's defined by a
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
national student course of course I
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
forget the name of it off the top of my
 
01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.110 align:start position:0%
forget the name of it off the top of my
head

01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
head
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
um the it's called the sched code and
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's a school course in exchange for
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
data it's a National Database that we
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
use to kind of Define courses in general
 
01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
and schools submit that data to us we do
 
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
then do a calculation and at the end of
 
01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
the year if we have excess adequacy
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
appropriation in our budget we will pay
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
that to the school
 
01:16:17.689 --> 01:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
so right now
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
um this the law is specific to home
 
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
school children it does not talk about
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
all children that are eligible for
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
curricular and co-curricular activities
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
so as representative Cardell you
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned so this now refers to a
 
01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
different section in the law for all
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
kids that would be eligible which would
 
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
include non-public Charter and
 
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
homeschool eligible children
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
um to your question representative
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
Woodcock when we're talking about a
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
non-public school so
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
we all talk about the word and use the
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
word private schools in New Hampshire
 
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
but there is no legal definition of
 
01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
private schools when we're talking about
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
K-12 education we're talk non-public
 
01:16:59.450 --> 01:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
school is the term that we use for all
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
schools that are not considered a public
 
01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.630 align:start position:0%
schools that are not considered a public
school

01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
that are approved by the Department of
 
01:17:04.739 --> 01:17:07.310 align:start position:0%
that are approved by the Department of
Education

01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
um so that's our current process that we
 
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
do right now so this bill expands the
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
definition to include kids that are so
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
we right now homeschool kids only and a
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
per class basis this does include
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
um non-public and charter school kids
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
that would be taking courses and then it
 
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
does expand it not only through high
 
01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:32.699 align:start position:0%
school but to include grades one through
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
twelve now we do know there are kids and
 
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
school districts call us fairly
 
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
frequently and say especially throughout
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
the cut the pandemic as kind of
 
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
education and learning change for a
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
variety of different ways through the
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
last couple years saying we have a lot
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
more homeschool kids that are taking
 
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
coursework at the elementary school
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
level are we eligible for that Aid at
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
the elementary school level and we say
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
no the law right now is specif is
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
specific to high school only so that's
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
the way we currently work Brian has a
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
few numbers he's just going to tell us
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
essentially how many kids have submitted
 
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
and how much the cost would be based on
 
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
our very narrow data set that we have
 
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
right now so before we go to Brian can
 
01:18:15.169 --> 01:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
we ask you a question here of course
 
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
um my question is that
 
01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:18.890 align:start position:0%
um my question is that
now

01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm having difficulty with
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
putting this 0.15 down into the grade
 
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
school level and I'm trying to Define
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
that we haven't they're very much
 
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
defined when we have the definition of
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
high school there which states that the
 
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
the level of grades following the middle
 
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
school or junior high school so that
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
would be a high school
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
so how are you as a department going to
 
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
decide that what they're doing at the
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
coming in for the language arts program
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
maybe at grade three is the equivalent
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
to 0.15 so the national
 
01:18:57.890 --> 01:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
the national course registry does
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
actually say third grade reading or
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
third grade math or third grade science
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
so it does break it down to that level
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
of special specificity on that
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
coursework and we would continue to use
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
those same levels of definitions
 
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
so the question I want to follow that up
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
with is that that's what those national
 
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
standards may say
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
but in practicality what's happening in
 
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
our grade schools is that language arts
 
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
may be taught all morning long in
 
01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
various courses or we may have it
 
01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
embedded in the social studies program
 
01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
as well so is someone going to come in
 
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
and want to only pay a 0.15 for being
 
01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
enrolled in
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
the grade school for half a day
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
so right now it's 0.15 for a class so if
 
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
they were if the school were to say that
 
01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
one class was taking a half of a day it
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
would still only be 0.15 they wouldn't
 
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
get 0.5 or anything like that even if it
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
were a full if it were a full day Arts
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
course for example it's still limited to
 
01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:58.729 align:start position:0%
course for example it's still limited to
0.115

01:19:58.729 --> 01:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
0.115
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
this is getting the same discussion we
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
had once before when we did this with
 
01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:05.219 align:start position:0%
co-curricular and all that right we
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
talked about defining the 0.15 which we
 
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:08.990 align:start position:0%
talked about defining the 0.15 which we
did

01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll go on with the rest yes
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative thank you Mr
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I myself don't like questions that
 
01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
are hypotheticals but I'm going to give
 
01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
you one
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
these co-curriculars
 
01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
and academic courses uh there's a space
 
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
availability issue like they will only
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
let the non-public school students do
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
these if they're space available is that
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
correct so right now
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
um this law is not changing who has
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
access to curricular and co-curricular
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
activities I am not sure how that is
 
01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
implemented at the local level okay so
 
01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
that was kind of just background my main
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
question is here's the hypothetical if
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
you had
 
01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
say there was only room for one more kid
 
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
and you had a homeschooled student
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
and a let's say a Catholic School
 
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
student given the laws it stands now it
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the public school would
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
prefer to have the homeschool student
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
because they would get perhaps this this
 
01:21:17.699 --> 01:21:19.310 align:start position:0%
because they would get perhaps this this
funding

01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
so uh how would you address that sort of
 
01:21:25.729 --> 01:21:25.739 align:start position:0%
issue that we would rely on the local
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
school district to have a policy in
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
place to as a local District yes issue
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
but it's a law where changed then they
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
would be forced to use different
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
criteria they couldn't use the
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this issue is if I'm
 
01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
expressing this clearly enough but I
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
understand you understand the issue I
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
understand okay and I just don't have an
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
answer for you okay I think the law
 
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
right now says it's up to the policy of
 
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
the local school district so they set
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
that policy and it may be different
 
01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
between District X and District y over
 
01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:00.050 align:start position:0%
between District X and District y over
here

01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:05.149 align:start position:0%
 
further

01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
right do you want to sure so
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
you know this bill is expanding to Great
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
school middle school basically one
 
01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
grades one through twelve looked at
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
enrollment and it appears that an
 
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
estimate would be that the total amount
 
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh to expand to grades one through
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
twelve would be 137 000 for school year
 
01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
22 enrollment and when we plug that into
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
the adequacy calculator which takes in
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
consideration the swept uh the actual
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
net increase would be 120 000 uh per
 
01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:39.050 align:start position:0%
net increase would be 120 000 uh per
year

01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner thank you and
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
um the way this bill is written about
 
01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
funds being available sounds to me
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
similar to the special ed
 
01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
where uh now we know that schools are
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
getting reimbursed like at you know 40
 
01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
50 percent of what they asked for
 
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
because the funds are not available they
 
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
haven't been budgeted
 
01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.590 align:start position:0%
haven't been budgeted
um

01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm worried that with the expansion
 
01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
of this uh and the expansion of of
 
01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:13.430 align:start position:0%
of this uh and the expansion of of
um

01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
you know that the public schools are
 
01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
going to have a burden
 
01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:18.950 align:start position:0%
going to have a burden
of

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:23:22.729 --> 01:23:22.739 align:start position:0%
being required uh to
 
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
allow these students to come in and take
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
their courses which
 
01:23:30.169 --> 01:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
um then bumps up
 
01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
their particular costs
 
01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:33.770 align:start position:0%
their particular costs
um

01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:36.649 --> 01:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
and yet the state is not reimbursing
 
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
what we're
 
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
are what we're relying on is that the
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education will make a
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
substantial uh amount available in their
 
01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
budget to cover
 
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
let's say 80 to 90 percent of the costs
 
01:23:54.169 --> 01:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
of local public schools
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
um through this program so
 
01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
and so I want to clarify
 
01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
um this bill does not expand who is
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
currently Acts or eligible to access
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
this coursework so the children that
 
01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
this bill would pay for are already able
 
01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
to access the coursework at schools
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
this bill only allows the Department of
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
Education to then include that number
 
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
and if we have appropriation to then pay
 
01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
that so that's my first point my second
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
point is I know I'm getting a little bit
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
ahead of myself but the 1045 Bill does
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
actually remove that amount that says if
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
the appropriation is available and
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
specifies that the Department of
 
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
Education shall pay it no matter what
 
01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
the appropriation is just like we do for
 
01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
regular adequacy
 
01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that's all about
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
your statement that this this bill does
 
01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
not expand the number of students that
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
are eligible to take this and it seems
 
01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:47.699 align:start position:0%
to me that's one of the points of the
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
bill sorry I did actually misspeak um so
 
01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
as far as the homeschool kids it does
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
not expand but it wouldn't guess that is
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
correct it is it it expands it to the
 
01:24:58.490 --> 01:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
non-public and the um charter school
 
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
children yes
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
well also actually the
 
01:25:03.719 --> 01:25:04.790 align:start position:0%
well also actually the
I'm

01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
I'm getting confused too so this is fun
 
01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
um so those kids are currently eligible
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
to take coursework in the school per RSA
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
193 C or 193 1C or whatever it is
 
01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
they're currently there they're
 
01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
currently taking coursework all this is
 
01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
doing is expanding the types of children
 
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
that are accessing coursework that the
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Education can reimburse
 
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
schools for but it's not reimbursing the
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's not expanding the allowable
 
01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
categories for curricular and
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
co-curricular participation under that
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
section of the law
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
um so I'm confused now
 
01:25:42.649 --> 01:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
um this is what happens we have a Friday
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
hearing yes yes and I probably didn't
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:50.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this is expanding uh
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
to the lower grades which
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
um I I have not had anybody tell me that
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
they're doing that right now uh what I
 
01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
hear is that you know it's at the high
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
school level with like chemistry courses
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
and things like that and it's also
 
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
extending it to kids who are now
 
01:26:18.169 --> 01:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
students who are now enrolled in uh
 
01:26:18.179 --> 01:26:19.729 align:start position:0%
students who are now enrolled in uh
non-public

01:26:19.729 --> 01:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
non-public
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
private schools that are not necessarily
 
01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
home school students
 
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
so those kids are already eligible under
 
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
the existing law so
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
particip so we have two separate
 
01:26:35.229 --> 01:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
category issues here so we have RSA 193
 
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
colon 1C and now you all have law books
 
01:26:39.649 --> 01:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
now right so you should be very happy
 
01:26:42.169 --> 01:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
about this so we can all follow along
 
01:26:42.179 --> 01:26:43.729 align:start position:0%
about this so we can all follow along
together

01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
um so and that law is access to public
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
school programs by non-public public
 
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
chartered and home education pupils so
 
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
this already talks about who is eligible
 
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
so these kids are already eligible to
 
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
participate at for at for curricular and
 
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
co-curricular coursework at their school
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
no grade level required so this is a the
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
the bill that we have today is now going
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
to allow the Department of Education to
 
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
reimburse schools for kids that are
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
accessing through this section of law
 
01:27:23.209 --> 01:27:23.219 align:start position:0%
the current law allows the Department of
 
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
Education to only reimburse homeschool
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
kids and High School
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
so now this will be all kids that are
 
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
accessing it and then the 1045 Bill does
 
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
something similar and in addition allows
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to pay that
 
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
no matter what our appropriation is
 
01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:47.990 align:start position:0%
no matter what our appropriation is

okay

01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay

01:28:10.729 --> 01:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
representative Lila
 
01:28:12.729 --> 01:28:12.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:15.260 align:start position:0%
clarifying this for me did I hear right
 
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
that Mr Eaton said that it would expand
 
01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
to 120
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
000 students would be expanded and
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for this that they currently
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
aren't available no that's the dollar
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
amount a hundred and twenty thousand
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
dollars oh okay excuse me thank you I
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
should specify that is the kids that the
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
schools are currently submitting there
 
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
are kids that are participating in
 
01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
school in this coursework that the
 
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
schools are not submitting because
 
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
they're not eligible for these funds so
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
so question for you that is reflecting
 
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
what we have currently which is High
 
01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:50.090 align:start position:0%
what we have currently which is High
School

01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
School
 
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
are you assuming then we're going to get
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
none from the grade schools no we we
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely would we just don't have an
 
01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
additional data set to share on that we
 
01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
and we have had schools that reached out
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
that said can we submit kids that are
 
01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
not in high school for this and and the
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
school say why is it just high school
 
01:29:09.770 --> 01:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
kids and then why is it just this so yes
 
01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
this is we had that question at one
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
point in time and the question came up
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
how do you define what that time limit
 
01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
is in the grade school
 
01:29:24.169 --> 01:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
whereas we had a specific time for High
 
01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
School courses based upon block
 
01:29:27.649 --> 01:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
scheduling or the types of scheduling
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
that they are doing at their the course
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
starts and it stops so the teaching of
 
01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
Concepts in the grade school don't start
 
01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
and stop from 9 to 10 o'clock it also
 
01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
carries over into where it might be
 
01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
embedded in another science or social
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
studies class as well
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm I'm you know I'm all good
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
with the high school that as we're doing
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
it and doing this for high school swirl
 
01:29:54.649 --> 01:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
but I
 
01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:57.900 align:start position:0%
I'm real concerned about the the and and
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
we do require
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
um for each course that is being
 
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
submitted or for each student that's
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
being submitted that the school specify
 
01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
the course that is being taken so they
 
01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
can't just say oh they were there for
 
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
0.7 of a time they say that Caitlin
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
Davis was here at this time and she took
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
read a third grade reading and then she
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
took second grade math or whatever and
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
well actually we and then so we say for
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
each one of those coursework and we'll
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
cap it at the traditional adequacy
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
amount we're not going to give more than
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
that so we're going to say for each
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
coursework that you're enrolling in that
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
is capped at 0.15
 
01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Tanner
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
um just
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
do you have specific
 
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.330 align:start position:0%
do you have specific
um

01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
figures for uh well this year may be
 
01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
before covid and also maybe for this
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
year of
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
how many public schools submitted for
 
01:30:52.679 --> 01:30:54.110 align:start position:0%
how many public schools submitted for
reimbursement

01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
how much was actually reimbursed and
 
01:30:59.090 --> 01:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
also my question is
 
01:30:59.100 --> 01:30:59.689 align:start position:0%
also my question is
um

01:30:59.689 --> 01:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
when do they get that reimbursement so
 
01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
does the I assume that The Homeschool
 
01:31:08.410 --> 01:31:08.420 align:start position:0%
person student or non-public or whatever
 
01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't even have to uh declare that
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
they're coming in for that particular
 
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
course uh so that the school district
 
01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:17.699 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the chance to budget for
 
01:31:17.699 --> 01:31:18.890 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the chance to budget for
that

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:18.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
um and it if it's worked on ADM they
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
don't get reimbursed until the next year
 
01:31:27.890 --> 01:31:27.900 align:start position:0%
for what happened the year before that
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
is correct it's actually paid at the
 
01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
very end of the following year too
 
01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
because we need to make sure that we
 
01:31:34.729 --> 01:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
have enough appropriation to pay
 
01:31:37.129 --> 01:31:37.139 align:start position:0%
everything else throughout the year so
 
01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
in a summer a school will tell us how
 
01:31:42.649 --> 01:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
many homeschool kids they had and and
 
01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
the courses that they took and then we
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
take that ADM and we start doing our
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
October 1st calculation we pay October
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
1st November 1st January 1st and we come
 
01:31:54.649 --> 01:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
down to April and we say all right well
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
our last we recalculate one more time
 
01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
and we say all right we owed schools 700
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars and we had 701 million
 
01:32:05.930 --> 01:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
dollars of appropriation so we can play
 
01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
that homeschool amount or we only had
 
01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
680 million dollars and so we can't pay
 
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
the homeschool appropriation so we have
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
not paid that appropriation at least in
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
the last three years
 
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
um and so we're talking about
 
01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
hundred to two hundred thousand dollars
 
01:32:25.129 --> 01:32:25.139 align:start position:0%
right now that we could have should have
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
paid based on the current law had we had
 
01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
appropriation but we did not have not
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
had the access appropriation so you're
 
01:32:33.490 --> 01:32:33.500 align:start position:0%
saying that in the last three years
 
01:32:37.310 --> 01:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
knows public school got reimbursed for
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
extra students coming into classes is
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct
 
01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Myler
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
thank you what's the incident rate you
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
had for requests for this kind of a
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
payment in the uh Lo and the change
 
01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.510 align:start position:0%
payment in the uh Lo and the change
law

01:32:58.510 --> 01:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
in other words currently it's clear
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
about the high school what's the
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
incident rate you've had for requests
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
from school districts 4K to eight let's
 
01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
say so we don't have reliable data on
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
that because schools schools will only
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
the only reason that they're doing this
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
report is to get that adequacy and the
 
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
report does specify that it should be
 
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
high school kids so we don't have a good
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
great count thank you
 
01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Belcher
 
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
coming down the line then from there
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
so it seems like a lot of the
 
01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
questioning around this involves
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement perhaps for students who
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
are participating in extracurriculars
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
and sports and whatnot so my question is
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
for those parents who are living in the
 
01:33:45.169 --> 01:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
districts who are perhaps educating or
 
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
homeschooling or non-public schooling
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
their children and who are local
 
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in that District to these
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
schools assuming they're not getting
 
01:33:57.770 --> 01:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
sped or any other special programs what
 
01:33:59.689 --> 01:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
are they getting from the district for
 
01:34:01.629 --> 01:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
those taxes they're paying in right now
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
that would be a great question for our
 
01:34:08.330 --> 01:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.729 --> 01:34:10.739 align:start position:0%
okay represent woodcock
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to go to back to
 
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
Brian because the because I get lost in
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
your two numbers
 
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
um if I may you started with 130 137
 
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
and then you went to 120 and and I got
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
the 120 being the money but I'm really
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
sort of confused if you just give me a
 
01:34:34.570 --> 01:34:34.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:36.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
taking the adequacy base rate of
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
3866.18 and taking the ADM of those
 
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
homeschool students within school year
 
01:34:51.169 --> 01:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
one thousand oh sorry 137 124 plugging
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
that ADM into our adequacy calculator
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
which takes in consideration to swept so
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
some you're right so
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
um that brings it down to 120 000 120
 
01:35:08.159 --> 01:35:11.450 align:start position:0%
um that brings it down to 120 000 120
143.45

01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:12.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
for those additional homeschool students
 
01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you thank you
 
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
so I just want to clarify my
 
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly then that we are
 
01:35:30.110 --> 01:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
requiring presently
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
school systems to for 9 through 12
 
01:35:33.239 --> 01:35:35.390 align:start position:0%
school systems to for 9 through 12
students

01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh accommodate
 
01:35:41.290 --> 01:35:41.300 align:start position:0%
or both curricular and co-curricular
 
01:35:43.970 --> 01:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
with no guarantee of getting reimbursed
 
01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
for it and if this bill were to pass we
 
01:35:49.129 --> 01:35:49.139 align:start position:0%
would be doing that for all students
 
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
from any educational setting is that
 
01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:55.250 align:start position:0%
from any educational setting is that
correct

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:56.590 align:start position:0%
correct
huh

01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
huh
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
yes I think so
 
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you a little caveat though you
 
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
said the word require and in its
 
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
concordance with policy uh at the high
 
01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
school level right now so there's going
 
01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
to be other conditions for acceptance
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
into that course or that you know the
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
pro program do you have the
 
01:36:18.910 --> 01:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
prerequisites to get into that course
 
01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
and co-curriculars all kinds of them
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that yeah
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
and further questions of the department
 
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
not seeing you're off the hook
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and that does to see
 
01:36:39.129 --> 01:36:39.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay the next bill which we have we're
 
01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
going to start in about five minutes
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to give everybody a stand up
 
01:36:58.010 --> 01:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
here stretch it a little bit and we'll
 
01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
come back and and start this at five
 
01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:06.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.770 align:start position:0%
 
especially

01:37:08.770 --> 01:37:08.780 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
some put that in a minute yeah I think
 
01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm good with it
 
01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:22.149 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm good with it
um

01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
course when it starts when it stops they
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
can Define the course but it's it's a
 
01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.970 --> 01:47:51.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
yeah for the record my name is
 
01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative Deb Hobson and I'm
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative to Rockingham County
 
01:48:01.609 --> 01:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
district 14 and I was asked to submit
 
01:48:04.490 --> 01:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
this bill on behalf of the doe so you
 
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
can imagine my surprise when uh the
 
01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
hearing before Isabel it's almost
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
exactly the same and it's an area that I
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
only know a very uh superficial layer so
 
01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask that Caitlin Davis come
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
up here and help me
 
01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:22.139 align:start position:0%
from the DOE
 
01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.229 --> 01:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
okay perfect I'd be happy to relinquish
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
my chair oh and additionally I do have
 
01:48:45.890 --> 01:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
an amendment uh for this bill so I would
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.050 --> 01:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.060 --> 01:49:19.129 align:start position:0%
 
nope

01:49:19.129 --> 01:49:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record Caitlin
 
01:49:24.169 --> 01:49:24.179 align:start position:0%
Davis from the Department of Education
 
01:49:26.330 --> 01:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
um let's start over let's forget the
 
01:49:28.689 --> 01:49:28.699 align:start position:0%
last hearing
 
01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
so I tried to give you all some kind of
 
01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:32.930 align:start position:0%
so I tried to give you all some kind of
information

01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:49:36.169 --> 01:49:36.179 align:start position:0%
um before uh but I think the first thing
 
01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
that we want to think about is so we're
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
going to start from scratch forget the
 
01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:41.820 align:start position:0%
last half hour that we've had here is in
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
your law book or computer or whatever
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
you have direct your attention to page
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
506 which talks about access to
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
curricular and not non-curricular
 
01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:55.370 align:start position:0%
curricular and not non-curricular
activities

01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
so our co-curricular rather not
 
01:49:58.260 --> 01:49:59.570 align:start position:0%
so our co-curricular rather not
non-curricular

01:49:59.570 --> 01:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
non-curricular
 
01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
um so that
 
01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
is the list of kids who currently have
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
access to curricular and co-curricular
 
01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
activities at schools
 
01:50:13.090 --> 01:50:13.100 align:start position:0%
So currently it says non-public
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
chartered and home educated students
 
01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
have access to curricular and
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities local school
 
01:50:22.970 --> 01:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
districts have policies on who can
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
access them relative to your questions
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
about if students are you know our
 
01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
classes are over subscribed and whatnot
 
01:50:35.689 --> 01:50:35.699 align:start position:0%
but so that is that section of the law
 
01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
we're not changing that neither of these
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
bills change is that section right now
 
01:50:46.250 --> 01:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
then under RSA 198
 
01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:48.709 align:start position:0%
then under RSA 198
38

01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
38
 
01:50:50.689 --> 01:50:50.699 align:start position:0%
that's the section of the law that both
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
of these bills are amending
 
01:50:54.649 --> 01:50:54.659 align:start position:0%
that is the bill that the Department of
 
01:50:57.950 --> 01:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
Education pays for certain coursework
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
so our current our current process is
 
01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education pays for
 
01:51:07.010 --> 01:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
coursework related to kids that are home
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
educated participating in academic
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
this bill which and I do have a um did
 
01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
you pass out the amendment okay so they
 
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
have an amendment
 
01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
um so the bill that you have in front of
 
01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
you the one initially introduced on
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
behalf of the department
 
01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
was the department had suggested
 
01:51:37.490 --> 01:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
expanding it to 1 through 12 because of
 
01:51:40.129 --> 01:51:40.139 align:start position:0%
the number of schools that had reached
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
out to the Department of Education and
 
01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
was looking for additional support
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
relative to courses that they were
 
01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
offering throughout the year
 
01:51:50.330 --> 01:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education also had
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
suggested that we would get rid of the
 
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
language that we said to the extent that
 
01:51:57.169 --> 01:51:57.179 align:start position:0%
Appropriations were available and said
 
01:51:59.930 --> 01:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
let's fund this for every kid that's
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
taking a course so let's pay the public
 
01:52:04.669 --> 01:52:04.679 align:start position:0%
schools for every kid that's taking a
 
01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
course regardless of the appropriation
 
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
available to the Department of Education
 
01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
so those were the suggestions that came
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the Department of Education
 
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that you have in front
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
of you
 
01:52:22.609 --> 01:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
01:52:25.729 --> 01:52:25.739 align:start position:0%
um just homeschool kids which that was
 
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
the original Bill the amendment then
 
01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:33.050 align:start position:0%
the original Bill the amendment then
includes

01:52:33.050 --> 01:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:35.390 --> 01:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
um all kids eligible to participate
 
01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
under the existing law so all existing
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
kids that are currently eligible to
 
01:52:40.199 --> 01:52:41.330 align:start position:0%
kids that are currently eligible to
participate

01:52:41.330 --> 01:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
participate
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
non-public chartered and home educated
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
in in the
 
01:52:50.090 --> 01:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
um so that does expand the number of
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
kids that we would pay for
 
01:52:54.590 --> 01:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
but it does not expand the number of
 
01:53:00.169 --> 01:53:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
um so the only
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
kind of issue that I may be seeing now
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
of course with the amendment is that
 
01:53:10.510 --> 01:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
it's a public elementary or High School
 
01:53:13.850 --> 01:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
however we do have middle schools in the
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
state that may not fall under that
 
01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
category of elementary school so we may
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
um to correct my testimony on the last
 
01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:30.350 align:start position:0%
um to correct my testimony on the last
spell

01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
spell
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
um so we have paid this so This aid went
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
in place it passed in the 2016 and 17
 
01:53:40.609 --> 01:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
biennium budget in the summer of 2015.
 
01:53:43.729 --> 01:53:43.739 align:start position:0%
since that time we have paid this Aid
 
01:53:46.850 --> 01:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
three times but I did say not in the
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
last three years which is incorrect we
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
paid it in fiscal year 17 fiscal year 18
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
and fiscal year 21.
 
01:54:00.050 --> 01:54:00.060 align:start position:0%
to the tune of in 2017 134 thousand
 
01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:02.450 align:start position:0%
to the tune of in 2017 134 thousand
dollars

01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
um a hundred and four thousand dollars
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 18 and 143 000 in 21. and
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
that is on
 
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
so the hundred and in 2017 of the
 
01:54:17.209 --> 01:54:17.219 align:start position:0%
hundred and thirty four thousand dollars
 
01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
we paid
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
that was included in the 927 million
 
01:54:25.129 --> 01:54:25.139 align:start position:0%
dollars in adequacy that we paid
 
01:54:26.689 --> 01:54:26.699 align:start position:0%
um a hundred and four thousand dollars
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
was included in the nine hundred and
 
01:54:30.410 --> 01:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
twenty four million dollars of adequacy
 
01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
that we paid and in fiscal year 21 the
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
143 to thousand dollars was car was
 
01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
included in the 1.1 billion dollars in
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
adequacy that we paid
 
01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:48.830 align:start position:0%
adequacy that we paid
so

01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:52.729 --> 01:54:52.739 align:start position:0%
thank you yes so yeah
 
01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:56.699 align:start position:0%
um so in 17 18 and 21
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
were schools reimbursed 100 of what they
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
um applied for yes
 
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
four grades nine through 12 home
 
01:55:07.129 --> 01:55:07.139 align:start position:0%
educated students
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
okay and we're we're expanding that now
 
01:55:09.659 --> 01:55:11.450 align:start position:0%
okay and we're we're expanding that now
so

01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
um the the budget should reflect
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
the budget proposal to the to finance
 
01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:18.830 align:start position:0%
the budget proposal to the to finance
should

01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
reflect the fact that we need a lot more
 
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
money in that particular area to cover
 
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
all the
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
um a lot more money depending on your
 
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
definition of a lot more money maybe a
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars on a billion
 
01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.140 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars on a billion
dollars

01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:32.150 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:55:32.150 --> 01:55:34.850 align:start position:0%
dollars
[Music]

01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:55:37.729 --> 01:55:37.739 align:start position:0%
when the department went ahead with this
 
01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'm still having a real gut ache with
 
01:55:43.370 --> 01:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
the elementary schools
 
01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:44.030 align:start position:0%
the elementary schools
um

01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:46.010 --> 01:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
as an elementary teacher and an
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
elementary principal for all these years
 
01:55:50.930 --> 01:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
I noticed and I I know that how we teach
 
01:55:54.109 --> 01:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
the grade schools you can't say language
 
01:55:57.169 --> 01:55:57.179 align:start position:0%
arts is only taught during nine to ten
 
01:55:59.570 --> 01:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
for example today being the day in which
 
01:56:01.729 --> 01:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
we remember the Holocaust and genocide
 
01:56:03.649 --> 01:56:03.659 align:start position:0%
so we then look at the num the book
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
number of the Stars by Lois Lowry who
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
dealt with daring to get the Jews out of
 
01:56:11.930 --> 01:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
Denmark to Sweden we teach that in
 
01:56:14.330 --> 01:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
social studies but we're also having
 
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
kids read the Thematic reader as part of
 
01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
our language arts program or we could do
 
01:56:21.649 --> 01:56:21.659 align:start position:0%
another book Like Elephant In the Garden
 
01:56:24.590 --> 01:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
by Michael morpurgo which deals with the
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
bombing of Dresden and trying to get an
 
01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
elephant out of there and I won't go
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
into the story but it's all good reading
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
but it's done in conjunction with social
 
01:56:35.570 --> 01:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
studies and literature so language so
 
01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to gel this down to
 
01:56:39.729 --> 01:56:39.739 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a 0.15 for a course
 
01:56:42.590 --> 01:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
what is the definition of a course I
 
01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:44.820 align:start position:0%
know you're given the national stuff but
 
01:56:46.129 --> 01:56:46.139 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
01:56:48.890 --> 01:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not National we are New
 
01:56:51.169 --> 01:56:51.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and how we teach here is we
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
are trying to have thematic approaches
 
01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
to this and I think it's the best way to
 
01:56:58.189 --> 01:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
teach some of the uh needs that we have
 
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
in social studies through reading some
 
01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
of this wonderful literature that's been
 
01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
written for intermediate level students
 
01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
grades three four five six so it has did
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
the department consider at all that of
 
01:57:15.050 --> 01:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
course as we Define for the high school
 
01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
is going to be appropriate for what
 
01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
what our process would be would be for a
 
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
school to Define their course so a
 
01:57:30.530 --> 01:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
school will have to select a course from
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
an existing list of coursework so they
 
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
will have to use their best judgment to
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
say this kid was taking a reading class
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
or this kid was taking a math class and
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
aligned the specific course a school is
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
going to have to do that and before the
 
01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
Department of Education will reimburse
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
and I know this is not a question but
 
01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
the department wants us to start getting
 
01:57:59.330 --> 01:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
and taking this Knowledge and Skills and
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
applying this Knowledge and Skills in
 
01:58:03.649 --> 01:58:03.659 align:start position:0%
the grade schools we apply it through
 
01:58:06.169 --> 01:58:06.179 align:start position:0%
other courses well but it's all compiled
 
01:58:08.810 --> 01:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
into learning how to read
 
01:58:11.930 --> 01:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't start and stop between
 
01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
nine and ten
 
01:58:16.370 --> 01:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
as it would in Block scheduling or
 
01:58:17.930 --> 01:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
scheduling at a high school which is
 
01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
easier to Define because we're talking
 
01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
about graduation credits we're not
 
01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
talking about graduation credits we
 
01:58:25.850 --> 01:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
talked about class and program when we
 
01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
get the grade schools so
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you Mr
 
01:58:30.599 --> 01:58:31.609 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you Mr
chairman

01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:58:33.770 --> 01:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
um thank you Miss Davis
 
01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:35.149 align:start position:0%
um thank you Miss Davis
um

01:58:35.149 --> 01:58:35.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned about elementary and
 
01:58:39.649 --> 01:58:39.659 align:start position:0%
middle schools
 
01:58:41.450 --> 01:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
um and middle schools you know maybe
 
01:58:43.070 --> 01:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
being covered
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and I was looking at
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
um lines 19 uh meaning of elementary
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
school is defined in 194 19a
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
right so this is very instructive
 
01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
um based on another bill that we have to
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
re-codify our education statutes because
 
01:59:05.149 --> 01:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
if you look at 194 19a the definition of
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
an elementary school it says for the
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
purpose of this chapter in elementary
 
01:59:13.810 --> 01:59:13.820 align:start position:0%
school is set forth as in 189.25
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
so looking at 189.25 it says
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.729 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:59:25.729 --> 01:59:25.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:27.770 --> 01:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
in elementary is any school approved by
 
01:59:29.450 --> 01:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education in which
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
the subjects taught are presented by the
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
state board for grades kindergarten
 
01:59:38.410 --> 01:59:38.420 align:start position:0%
through eight of the public schools
 
01:59:41.209 --> 01:59:41.219 align:start position:0%
so I think we're okay in terms of
 
01:59:44.089 --> 01:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
covering Middle School levels but I
 
01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
don't know if we want to change the
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
reference to the 18925 or
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
um but that's a great example of uh need
 
01:59:53.930 --> 01:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
for recodification of our statutes
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
and further let me cut into that it's
 
01:59:58.850 --> 01:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
further need to re-codify seeing that
 
02:00:01.010 --> 02:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
middle schools Define its grades four
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
through eight right
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
and so we're talking about what we call
 
02:00:07.070 --> 02:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
the intermediate grades when talking
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
about grades four or five and possibly
 
02:00:09.239 --> 02:00:11.689 align:start position:0%
about grades four or five and possibly
six

02:00:11.689 --> 02:00:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.609 --> 02:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
represent Myler
 
02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm going to ask the
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
same question again obviously this is a
 
02:00:22.850 --> 02:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
this is a department request and so
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a basis for the
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
Department request from a standpoint I
 
02:00:29.209 --> 02:00:29.219 align:start position:0%
would assume that you've had inquiries
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
from school districts
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
about expanding this through elementary
 
02:00:36.290 --> 02:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
and middle school so I'm asking the
 
02:00:38.689 --> 02:00:38.699 align:start position:0%
question again how often have you
 
02:00:41.089 --> 02:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
received these kinds of requests
 
02:00:44.089 --> 02:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
is there a need for this so we currently
 
02:00:44.099 --> 02:00:45.890 align:start position:0%
is there a need for this so we currently
collect

02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
collect
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
the data once a year from all schools
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
our current collection doesn't specify
 
02:00:52.850 --> 02:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
that it's High School only
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
but right now so the grades levels that
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
we throw of this last year's date so
 
02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
1138 kids
 
02:01:07.010 --> 02:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
that the school districts told us we're
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
taking coursework now these are kids not
 
02:01:11.810 --> 02:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
courses so they each one of these could
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
break down to 1.15
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.209 --> 02:01:32.219 align:start position:0%
and 516 were in grades one through eight
 
02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
and 31 kindergarteners
 
02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:42.410 align:start position:0%
and 31 kindergarteners
foreign

02:01:42.410 --> 02:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:46.310 align:start position:0%
thank you
wood

02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
wood
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
if a child was getting their
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
language arts partially through history
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
and the child was there for
 
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
specific language arts instruction and
 
02:02:03.410 --> 02:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
history instruction would that be two
 
02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:05.149 align:start position:0%
history instruction would that be two
courses

02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
courses
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
and could the fact that they're there
 
02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
for half a day
 
02:02:12.410 --> 02:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
and they're actually during that half a
 
02:02:16.250 --> 02:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
day there for history there for math
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
there for you know could you
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
count 0.15 for each of those
 
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
and with that's
 
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
solve that problem and is that something
 
02:02:31.629 --> 02:02:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:33.649 --> 02:02:33.659 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that question
 
02:02:34.850 --> 02:02:34.860 align:start position:0%
we would really have to have a
 
02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
conversation with the schools and you
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
kind of say how does it break down to
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
the specific data prescriptive standards
 
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
that we've we've told them to report
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
that information on thank you
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative
 
02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:47.629 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative
balbooni

02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
balbooni
 
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:02:53.390 --> 02:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
um the previous Bill focused on grades
 
02:02:56.209 --> 02:02:56.219 align:start position:0%
one uh through 12 and this particular
 
02:02:59.089 --> 02:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
Bill starts at kindergarten through 12.
 
02:03:01.609 --> 02:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
um what why is there a difference I'm
 
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
not sure the drafting difference
 
02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
I am I'm I am not sure what the drafting
 
02:03:11.050 --> 02:03:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh cordelli and then
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner uh thank you Mr
 
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you again
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
um based on the 2022 numbers of 1138
 
02:03:24.890 --> 02:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
kids taking courses that were
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
approximately uh 547 kindergarten
 
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
through eighth grade
 
02:03:34.370 --> 02:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
um taking courses assuming each kid took
 
02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
one course
 
02:03:40.490 --> 02:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
um there are 547 courses offered by
 
02:03:42.410 --> 02:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
public schools for which they were not
 
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursed but would be reimbursed if
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass is that correct
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner thank you
 
02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:53.689 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner thank you
um

02:03:53.689 --> 02:03:53.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
just the last statement you made about
 
02:03:58.370 --> 02:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
the the number of students and and the
 
02:03:58.380 --> 02:03:59.870 align:start position:0%
the the number of students and and the
reimbursement

02:03:59.870 --> 02:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
um in high school it's by course so it's
 
02:04:04.729 --> 02:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
like chemistry course which may meet
 
02:04:07.729 --> 02:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
every day or or whatever but in an
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
elementary school
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
um as representative laddis continually
 
02:04:14.930 --> 02:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
talked about is different setup
 
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
could a parent
 
02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:17.990 align:start position:0%
could a parent
um

02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:20.570 --> 02:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
have a kid have their student have their
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
child go to public school on let's say
 
02:04:25.129 --> 02:04:25.139 align:start position:0%
Monday Wednesday Friday and then
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
homeschool them on Tuesday Thursday
 
02:04:31.149 --> 02:04:31.159 align:start position:0%
and uh get and would the school get
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
reimbursed 0.15 each day that the child
 
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.149 --> 02:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
the entire year attendance isn't really
 
02:04:44.330 --> 02:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
relative to it so if a child was to
 
02:04:46.370 --> 02:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
enroll in a course we would accept
 
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
expect them to participate in the entire
 
02:04:53.209 --> 02:04:53.219 align:start position:0%
length of the course I'm not sure
 
02:04:56.270 --> 02:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
how your scenario would apply to this
 
02:04:59.390 --> 02:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
but uh and and in elementary would they
 
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
get let's say if they went in from nine
 
02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:02.930 align:start position:0%
get let's say if they went in from nine
to

02:05:02.930 --> 02:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
to noon and there was language arts and
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
and Mathematics and social studies
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
taught during that time integrated
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
together would the school receive just
 
02:05:17.209 --> 02:05:17.219 align:start position:0%
0.15 or would they receive 0.15 times
 
02:05:19.070 --> 02:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
three it depends on how the school
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
reports to us they're going to have to
 
02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
say that Linda Tana took a social
 
02:05:26.209 --> 02:05:26.219 align:start position:0%
studies class or 0.15 and then a reading
 
02:05:28.490 --> 02:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
class and then a math class the school
 
02:05:30.850 --> 02:05:30.860 align:start position:0%
it has to be prescriptive as far as
 
02:05:33.169 --> 02:05:33.179 align:start position:0%
saying the actual coursework that
 
02:05:35.570 --> 02:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
they're taking thank you
 
02:05:37.970 --> 02:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh I've got a question for you
 
02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
um in the high school you oftentimes
 
02:05:41.330 --> 02:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
will take the required courses maybe
 
02:05:43.609 --> 02:05:43.619 align:start position:0%
some electives and maybe get a study
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
hall in there so you may be taking five
 
02:05:46.669 --> 02:05:46.679 align:start position:0%
a day
 
02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding at least when I
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
was an administrator or principal over
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
in Maine that when we had the kids at
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
school for more than half of the
 
02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
academic program they're accounted as a
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
as a student publicly enrolled in the
 
02:06:04.810 --> 02:06:04.820 align:start position:0%
high school or the public school
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
therefore could not be homeschoolers
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
so we don't make that delineation the
 
02:06:13.010 --> 02:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
um however we do have a Sasa number that
 
02:06:17.930 --> 02:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
we're doing for each one of these so
 
02:06:20.330 --> 02:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
there's no way of counting them double
 
02:06:23.330 --> 02:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
if that's what your concern is
 
02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
that's part of my concern I'm still
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
going back I hearken to kindergarten I
 
02:06:28.729 --> 02:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
don't know how you're going to find a
 
02:06:29.930 --> 02:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
course when you're just trying to get
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
the kids settled down for 10 15 minutes
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
this and then you're on to another topic
 
02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
and then you're off the drawing and then
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
creoning and then
 
02:06:38.750 --> 02:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be how you're going to
 
02:06:40.490 --> 02:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
Define that did the department think of
 
02:06:43.609 --> 02:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
this so I mean there's a kindergarten
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
cool there are kindergarten codes in
 
02:06:45.599 --> 02:06:47.050 align:start position:0%
cool there are kindergarten codes in
this

02:06:47.050 --> 02:06:47.060 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:06:49.250 --> 02:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
prescriptive course code work and that's
 
02:06:52.609 --> 02:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
what we're going to rely on okay
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
all righty representative Myler thank
 
02:06:58.609 --> 02:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and since we've
 
02:07:01.070 --> 02:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
got the expert here
 
02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:03.659 align:start position:0%
could you define and delineate the
 
02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
difference between a d m a and a d m r
 
02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
of course yes and something I can answer
 
02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
so average daily membership and
 
02:07:20.050 --> 02:07:20.060 align:start position:0%
residence is where the kid lives
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
adma average daily membership in
 
02:07:25.250 --> 02:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
attendance is where the child is
 
02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:26.810 align:start position:0%
attendance is where the child is
attending

02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
attending
 
02:07:30.770 --> 02:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
so you may have a kid who is
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
um part of the
 
02:07:35.890 --> 02:07:35.900 align:start position:0%
see if I can pick a good example here
 
02:07:39.410 --> 02:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
for admr purposes
 
02:07:43.070 --> 02:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
um they are a resident of the town of
 
02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:44.330 align:start position:0%
um they are a resident of the town of
Epsom

02:07:44.330 --> 02:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
Epsom
 
02:07:47.330 --> 02:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
but for adma they are attending Pembroke
 
02:07:49.010 --> 02:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
Academy because they're high school kid
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
so they would be part of the ADM
 
02:07:57.050 --> 02:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
so admr the B from Epsom adma they would
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
be from Pembroke
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
so so admr is where the kid lives and
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
where that's how we calculate adequacy
 
02:08:08.089 --> 02:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
so the town of responsibility is based
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
on residency
 
02:08:12.290 --> 02:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
adma is where the child is living and
 
02:08:13.729 --> 02:08:13.739 align:start position:0%
that's how we calculate things like
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:18.890 --> 02:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
can you'd find a little bit more for me
 
02:08:21.050 --> 02:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
for example I'll use my
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
Wilderness school kids going there but
 
02:08:25.970 --> 02:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
they're a resident of the resident of
 
02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:27.430 align:start position:0%
they're a resident of the resident of
beholderness

02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
beholderness
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
holderness sends their high school kids
 
02:08:32.350 --> 02:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
to Plymouth
 
02:08:37.609 --> 02:08:37.619 align:start position:0%
so for ADM adma they'd be counted by
 
02:08:42.649 --> 02:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
Plymouth correct and admr they'd be uh
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
on on resident of polarness correct okay
 
02:08:49.609 --> 02:08:49.619 align:start position:0%
so I think we're on the same page
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
represent dry
 
02:08:53.450 --> 02:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman following up on
 
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
that in the Plainfield Town report it
 
02:08:59.209 --> 02:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
lists 213 public school students for the
 
02:09:01.550 --> 02:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
elementary school and then four
 
02:09:05.209 --> 02:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers for a total of 217 and is
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
that because those are the ones that
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
might be eligible that's I always wonder
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
why there weren't private school
 
02:09:13.609 --> 02:09:13.619 align:start position:0%
educated children included in that
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
number right we don't collect data on
 
02:09:18.850 --> 02:09:18.860 align:start position:0%
where the private school kids come from
 
02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
so the adma numbers and admr numbers
 
02:09:25.430 --> 02:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't include any private school kids
 
02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:27.290 align:start position:0%
don't include any private school kids
um

02:09:27.290 --> 02:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:29.689 --> 02:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
if you're seeing a difference you may
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
have two kids
 
02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
so if you may have an admr number that's
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
too high or is that what your example
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
said right when my children were there
 
02:09:39.709 --> 02:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
it was my kid's number were the extra
 
02:09:42.530 --> 02:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
ones added to the total
 
02:09:43.970 --> 02:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
um they shouldn't have been if they were
 
02:09:45.410 --> 02:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
homeschooled no
 
02:09:47.450 --> 02:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about adma and
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
admr of public schools
 
02:09:53.390 --> 02:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
um and let me make sure I remember my
 
02:09:55.199 --> 02:09:56.750 align:start position:0%
um and let me make sure I remember my
question

02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
if this changes would they be included
 
02:10:03.250 --> 02:10:03.260 align:start position:0%
in the total of students would
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
non-public school students also be
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:12.290 --> 02:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
um if this bill is enacted
 
02:10:16.010 --> 02:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
and they were taking classes they would
 
02:10:19.609 --> 02:10:19.619 align:start position:0%
be in an admr for the purpose of
 
02:10:22.729 --> 02:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
calculating this essential the
 
02:10:24.589 --> 02:10:24.599 align:start position:0%
differentiated as far as the adequate
 
02:10:27.290 --> 02:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
education formula formulas involved but
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
not as far as other enrollment reports
 
02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there further
 
02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you very
 
02:10:36.609 --> 02:10:36.619 align:start position:0%
much Caitlin we really appreciate your
 
02:10:39.770 --> 02:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
what you do you know you're supposed to
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
know everything about Finance which you
 
02:10:44.089 --> 02:10:44.099 align:start position:0%
absolutely do and now you've been thrown
 
02:10:46.970 --> 02:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
in the arena at the policy side too
 
02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:48.350 align:start position:0%
in the arena at the policy side too
um

02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
okay that concludes testimony on this
 
02:10:56.639 --> 02:10:57.430 align:start position:0%
okay that concludes testimony on this
bill

02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:11:01.850 --> 02:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
and we're now into HB 501
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're buying jeans here 501.
 
02:11:07.609 --> 02:11:07.619 align:start position:0%
um relative to ages for special
 
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I know it this is your ADHD
 
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
I got to connect with you through that
 
02:11:35.890 --> 02:11:35.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy welcome
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
um good morning uh chairman Ladd Vice
 
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
chair cordellian honorable members of
 
02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:11:46.970 --> 02:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm Nancy Murphy here uh representing
 
02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough 12 the town of Merrimack
 
02:11:53.570 --> 02:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to introduce hb501 relative
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
to the ages for special education this
 
02:11:58.609 --> 02:11:58.619 align:start position:0%
bill is a housekeeping bill in the
 
02:12:00.589 --> 02:12:00.599 align:start position:0%
truest sense of the word
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
um its intent is just to make technical
 
02:12:05.629 --> 02:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
corrections to sections of RSA that were
 
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
inadvertently overlooked and remain
 
02:12:09.609 --> 02:12:09.619 align:start position:0%
unchanged when
 
02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
hb1513 sponsored by representative wood
 
02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
was passed last term
 
02:12:18.290 --> 02:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
HB 1513 match the previous HB 1558 that
 
02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
I sponsored in 2020 and passed this
 
02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee 20-0 HB 1513 brought RSA 186c
 
02:12:29.089 --> 02:12:29.099 align:start position:0%
special education into compliance under
 
02:12:31.550 --> 02:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
current federal law it amended the
 
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
definition of a child with disability to
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
match both federal state uh federal
 
02:12:39.169 --> 02:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
statute and federal regulations it
 
02:12:41.089 --> 02:12:41.099 align:start position:0%
didn't raise the age limit of a student
 
02:12:42.649 --> 02:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
entitled to a free and appropriate
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
public education it merely corrected the
 
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
ambiguity of RSA 186c in order to bring
 
02:12:52.129 --> 02:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute into Conformity
 
02:12:54.530 --> 02:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
with federal law there are eight places
 
02:12:56.330 --> 02:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
in the RSA that were mistakenly
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
overlooked that need to be amended for
 
02:13:02.209 --> 02:13:02.219 align:start position:0%
consistency with current law and HB 501
 
02:13:04.850 --> 02:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
is meant to correct that
 
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
um they are found in the bill before you
 
02:13:08.810 --> 02:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want me to
 
02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
review actually where they are but
 
02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
they're in bold and they're
 
02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
um they impact eight um different
 
02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
sections of the law
 
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
you don't need to go through one of
 
02:13:22.129 --> 02:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
those okay
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
um and I really that's that's uh it's
 
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple and it's just
 
02:13:29.689 --> 02:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately a couple of rounds it
 
02:13:32.510 --> 02:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
took us to find all the places where
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
um the 21 inclusive needed to be
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
included and and um
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
eliminate any confusion with conflicting
 
02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
statutes so thank you I think this is
 
02:13:44.330 --> 02:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're talking about
 
02:13:46.370 --> 02:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
re-codifying we don't have all those
 
02:13:48.770 --> 02:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
hyperlinks that take us to where we need
 
02:13:51.169 --> 02:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
to go when we make these changes it gets
 
02:13:52.970 --> 02:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
under one and there's five others loose
 
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
right yep
 
02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner I kind of remember
 
02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
this bill from from last term yeah and
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that um you know we all were
 
02:14:07.970 --> 02:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
concerned that uh a child with
 
02:14:10.250 --> 02:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
disabilities would get to be would would
 
02:14:12.890 --> 02:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
be in school start in September go
 
02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:13.850 align:start position:0%
be in school start in September go
through

02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
November and then say Oh you hit the
 
02:14:19.310 --> 02:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
magic number and you're out um and I
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
thought we we um
 
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
we kind of worked around that so that
 
02:14:25.729 --> 02:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen but it seems like
 
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
with this one it happens again
 
02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
is that correct or not no it's not
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
changing anything
 
02:14:34.490 --> 02:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
it's just there was just a couple of
 
02:14:36.109 --> 02:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies where it did not get
 
02:14:39.169 --> 02:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
changed to 21 inclusive so the laws
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
stayed the same it's not changing
 
02:14:42.709 --> 02:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
anything that hasn't already been should
 
02:14:45.229 --> 02:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
have been corrected when when you know
 
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
the statute was was amended
 
02:14:50.810 --> 02:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much uh thank
 
02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:56.510 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much uh thank
you

02:14:56.510 --> 02:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.729 --> 02:15:09.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Karen Rosenberg policy
 
02:15:14.450 --> 02:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
director of the disability rights Center
 
02:15:16.490 --> 02:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
I think ditto to what representative
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
Murphy just said this is a housekeeping
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
Bill an inadvertent admission
 
02:15:23.569 --> 02:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
um of you know noting all the places in
 
02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
our special ed law that were impacted
 
02:15:28.609 --> 02:15:28.619 align:start position:0%
when the legislature and Governor you
 
02:15:32.209 --> 02:15:32.219 align:start position:0%
know signed into law this new law that
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
increases eligibility to 21 inclusive so
 
02:15:39.050 --> 02:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
now that we actually have a definition
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
that's in Conformity with the federal
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
law in order to comply with federal law
 
02:15:45.890 --> 02:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
fully we need to make sure that we are
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
providing a free appropriate public
 
02:15:50.330 --> 02:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
education in our state law to all the
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
students who are eligible and so this
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
effectuates what you all intended to do
 
02:15:58.490 --> 02:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
um clears up any ambiguity and um
 
02:16:00.770 --> 02:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will get cleaned up and
 
02:16:03.050 --> 02:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
we'll move forward so I can take any
 
02:16:04.970 --> 02:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
questions but thank you are there any
 
02:16:04.980 --> 02:16:06.109 align:start position:0%
questions but thank you are there any
questions

02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
02:16:18.530 --> 02:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:20.750 --> 02:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning for the record

02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
um we just well I agree with everything
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's been said so far we understand
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
this to be a housekeeping Bill to to
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
make changes consistent with the change
 
02:16:34.129 --> 02:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
made last year we just wanted to
 
02:16:35.629 --> 02:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
reiterate on the record our
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that federal law does
 
02:16:40.849 --> 02:16:40.859 align:start position:0%
require the h21 inclusive standard so
 
02:16:42.290 --> 02:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions but we
 
02:16:44.509 --> 02:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure since this was
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
being opened up again that that we were
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
clear that that was our position on what
 
02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
the Federal Law requires thank you very
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
much other questions representative
 
02:16:51.599 --> 02:16:52.910 align:start position:0%
much other questions representative
Damon

02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
Damon
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question following on up on
 
02:16:58.610 --> 02:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner's query does
 
02:17:00.770 --> 02:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
federal law make any statement about
 
02:17:05.389 --> 02:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
individuals who as many would become 21
 
02:17:09.530 --> 02:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
mid way through the Academic Year
 
02:17:12.049 --> 02:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question uh no the
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
federal requirement only speaks to the
 
02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
age 21 inclusive language there's
 
02:17:17.690 --> 02:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
nothing in federal law that would
 
02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
prevent offering Services beyond that if
 
02:17:22.009 --> 02:17:22.019 align:start position:0%
you want to go through a school year I I
 
02:17:23.690 --> 02:17:23.700 align:start position:0%
do recall last year some discussion
 
02:17:26.209 --> 02:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
about having it end with a school year
 
02:17:28.610 --> 02:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
and that's permissible under federal law
 
02:17:30.169 --> 02:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
so long as that fiscal year where the
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
child has already reached age 21
 
02:17:33.709 --> 02:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
inclusive what the federal law
 
02:17:36.290 --> 02:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
requirement is is that at age up to age
 
02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
21 inclusive they have to be offered the
 
02:17:39.650 --> 02:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
services it would be up to the state to
 
02:17:41.450 --> 02:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
decide whether they stop them at that
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
which is the outer deadline or whether
 
02:17:44.810 --> 02:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
they decide to continue
 
02:17:46.849 --> 02:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
and we we would be agnostic on that
 
02:17:48.830 --> 02:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
point but to be a requirement with
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
federal law the services have to be uh
 
02:17:55.370 --> 02:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
offered up to age 21 inclusive yes
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
can you speak to what is happening now
 
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:02.049 --> 02:18:02.059 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:18:04.730 --> 02:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
my understanding and that question might
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
be better directed to the Department of
 
02:18:07.849 --> 02:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
Education folks but my understanding is
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
that since the law was passed last year
 
02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:12.599 align:start position:0%
um special ed services are provided up
 
02:18:14.810 --> 02:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
through age 21 inclusive there may be
 
02:18:16.910 --> 02:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
school districts that decide to offer
 
02:18:18.049 --> 02:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
services beyond that because they
 
02:18:19.370 --> 02:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be precluded from doing that
 
02:18:20.990 --> 02:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
but but
 
02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:21.889 align:start position:0%
but but
um

02:18:21.889 --> 02:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what the practice is I
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
don't have any knowledge about that that
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
is occurring and but they would they go
 
02:18:27.889 --> 02:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
beyond they're not going to get
 
02:18:29.570 --> 02:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for that that would be
 
02:18:30.889 --> 02:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
correct as well because the law provides
 
02:18:32.089 --> 02:18:32.099 align:start position:0%
for the reimbursement up through that
 
02:18:35.209 --> 02:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
atrium represent Belcher thank you Mr
 
02:18:35.219 --> 02:18:36.310 align:start position:0%
atrium represent Belcher thank you Mr
chair

02:18:36.310 --> 02:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:18:39.469 --> 02:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
being newer the language is a little
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
strange to me 21 inclusive is that just
 
02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
a more complicated way of saying 22 yeah
 
02:18:46.849 --> 02:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
that's a great question yeah so 21
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
inclusive means the entirety of the Year
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
where you are 21. so basically up until
 
02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
your 22nd birthday yep
 
02:18:55.490 --> 02:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
02:18:58.310 --> 02:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you um
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
welcome back to education
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
um uh I think you were here for quite a
 
02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
bit of this last year
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
um and um as I recall
 
02:19:10.129 --> 02:19:10.139 align:start position:0%
um 21 inclusive was used because it
 
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
mirrors federal law am I correct in that
 
02:19:16.730 --> 02:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes 21 inclusive is the
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
language in the idea correct are there
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you very much
 
02:19:23.690 --> 02:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
for taking the time to
 
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
and from the Department of Education as
 
02:19:31.009 --> 02:19:31.019 align:start position:0%
needed do we need to have Rebecca
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
Fredette come up anybody on the
 
02:19:35.570 --> 02:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
committee have questions for her
 
02:19:39.310 --> 02:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:43.849 --> 02:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
okay well you do you have a question
 
02:19:45.469 --> 02:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
I think she's indicating she can answer
 
02:19:47.929 --> 02:19:47.939 align:start position:0%
my last question oh I didn't hear that
 
02:20:00.170 --> 02:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
again I'm Rebecca Fred Adam the state
 
02:20:03.770 --> 02:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
director of special education and to
 
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
your question representative Damon it
 
02:20:07.969 --> 02:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
varies from town to town there are some
 
02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
school districts who will keep students
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
until the end of the school year and
 
02:20:13.969 --> 02:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
then will pay out of their local funds
 
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
for any Services they provide from their
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
birth date to the end of the school year
 
02:20:19.250 --> 02:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
but there are also schools that will
 
02:20:21.530 --> 02:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
have the student leave on the last day
 
02:20:23.810 --> 02:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
that they are 21. some of them do it on
 
02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
their birthday but some of them do it
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
most of them do it the day before

02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
not seeing any further pink cards up
 
02:20:40.849 --> 02:20:40.859 align:start position:0%
here we're going to close uh 501
 
02:20:42.770 --> 02:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
and move on to the last bill before
 
02:20:42.780 --> 02:20:46.190 align:start position:0%
and move on to the last bill before
lunch

02:20:46.190 --> 02:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
and we got to keep that nutrition up all
 
02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
those calories we need some donuts out
 
02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:52.070 align:start position:0%
those calories we need some donuts out
there

02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:20:52.080 --> 02:20:52.969 align:start position:0%
there
um

02:20:52.969 --> 02:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
HP 439 relative to the duty to provide
 
02:20:58.429 --> 02:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
an education and contracts with private
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:06.600 --> 02:21:13.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:21:13.090 --> 02:21:13.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
welcome representative cardelli again
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Glenn cordelli
 
02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
still representing Tuftonboro Wolfeboro
 
02:21:24.290 --> 02:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
section one deals with co-curricular no
 
02:21:29.530 --> 02:21:29.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry and that's the wrong Bill
 
02:21:33.309 --> 02:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
section one does deal with age 21
 
02:21:36.530 --> 02:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
inclusive however
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
um and tries to clean up
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
um that one section of Statute in the
 
02:21:45.469 --> 02:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
same way the previous Bill does so um
 
02:21:48.349 --> 02:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
there is a duplication between
 
02:21:50.450 --> 02:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
um that section and this bill and the
 
02:21:52.270 --> 02:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
previous bill
 
02:21:55.849 --> 02:21:55.859 align:start position:0%
this bill goes on and does one other
 
02:21:55.859 --> 02:21:58.010 align:start position:0%
this bill goes on and does one other
thing

02:21:58.010 --> 02:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:21:59.330 --> 02:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:00.230 align:start position:0%
um and
um

02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:03.650 --> 02:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
before I realized that we will have our
 
02:22:06.650 --> 02:22:06.660 align:start position:0%
new books going around or copies of the
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
two sections of Statute involved in this
 
02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:11.450 align:start position:0%
two sections of Statute involved in this
and

02:22:11.450 --> 02:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:11.460 --> 02:22:12.969 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:22:12.969 --> 02:22:12.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
439 in lines 8 and 9 repeals
 
02:22:22.010 --> 02:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
189 1 a
 
02:22:24.490 --> 02:22:24.500 align:start position:0%
Roman 4
 
02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
which is going around and is underlined
 
02:22:33.050 --> 02:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
that is repealed because it include it
 
02:22:35.809 --> 02:22:35.819 align:start position:0%
is for two reasons it includes language
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.050 --> 02:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
and duplicates what's in 1933 so
 
02:22:51.050 --> 02:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
um it's a minor re-codification attempt
 
02:22:51.060 --> 02:22:53.570 align:start position:0%
um it's a minor re-codification attempt
but

02:22:53.570 --> 02:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
the language that is in
 
02:22:59.809 --> 02:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
18918 duty to provide education room and
 
02:23:05.210 --> 02:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
four includes the ability to execute a
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
contract with any approved non-sectarian
 
02:23:09.170 --> 02:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
private school
 
02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:12.490 align:start position:0%
private school
that

02:23:12.490 --> 02:23:12.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:16.670 --> 02:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
non-sectarian language was removed a
 
02:23:20.210 --> 02:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
year ago and that is correctly reflected
 
02:23:25.309 --> 02:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
in 1933 which uh
 
02:23:28.370 --> 02:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
in this context applies to town
 
02:23:28.380 --> 02:23:30.490 align:start position:0%
in this context applies to town
tuitioning

02:23:30.490 --> 02:23:30.500 align:start position:0%
tuitioning
 
02:23:30.500 --> 02:23:32.110 align:start position:0%
tuitioning
so

02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:34.250 --> 02:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
you could say that this is another
 
02:23:37.090 --> 02:23:37.100 align:start position:0%
cleanup attempt
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
and they back to basically those are the
 
02:23:42.650 --> 02:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
two pieces of this
 
02:23:46.910 --> 02:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
HP 439 and be glad to take any questions
 
02:23:49.309 --> 02:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
yes represent McDonald thank you Mr
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for bringing this
 
02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
forward I'm just a clarifying question
 
02:23:55.730 --> 02:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
to be fully consistent with federal law
 
02:23:58.730 --> 02:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
we would need to pass both this bill 439
 
02:24:01.490 --> 02:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
and then the previous House Bill 501 is
 
02:24:03.050 --> 02:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
that right
 
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you merge them
 
02:24:09.469 --> 02:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
they passed the previous Bill to clean
 
02:24:09.479 --> 02:24:13.370 align:start position:0%
they passed the previous Bill to clean
up

02:24:13.370 --> 02:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:15.309 --> 02:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
the others didn't
 
02:24:19.309 --> 02:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
feel that statute that has our state
 
02:24:22.610 --> 02:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
language okay okay thank you
 
02:24:24.170 --> 02:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
02:24:25.929 --> 02:24:25.939 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
02:24:28.490 --> 02:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:24:33.170 --> 02:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
um this bill actually repeals RSA 189
 
02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
colon one dash a
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh for Roman numeral four
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
um isn't that essentially the Croydon
 
02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:42.170 align:start position:0%
um isn't that essentially the Croydon
bill

02:24:42.170 --> 02:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
um that we passed that allowed for
 
02:24:48.410 --> 02:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
schools that didn't have
 
02:24:50.270 --> 02:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh didn't provide public education
 
02:24:52.910 --> 02:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
During certain grades and this was um
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
with Croydon it was up to fourth grade
 
02:24:57.170 --> 02:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
and then after that that the school
 
02:24:59.690 --> 02:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
board could then contract with
 
02:25:02.530 --> 02:25:02.540 align:start position:0%
non-public schools I I know we took the
 
02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
non-sectarian part out of it
 
02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
um but it was so that the school board
 
02:25:11.270 --> 02:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
actually still retained uh the ability
 
02:25:13.969 --> 02:25:13.979 align:start position:0%
to oversee the education of the child
 
02:25:15.889 --> 02:25:15.899 align:start position:0%
that they were Contracting to another
 
02:25:19.130 --> 02:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
school so is this repeal repealing the
 
02:25:22.010 --> 02:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
fact that they can still contract
 
02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
um or or is it just repealing the
 
02:25:28.130 --> 02:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
non-sectarian part of it uh thank you
 
02:25:31.790 --> 02:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
um the ability to contract for provision
 
02:25:34.450 --> 02:25:34.460 align:start position:0%
of those grade levels to another school
 
02:25:41.469 --> 02:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
is in 193 3 Romans 6 and 7. so that is
 
02:25:45.050 --> 02:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
not impacted by
 
02:25:51.849 --> 02:25:51.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
was that was that
 
02:25:54.479 --> 02:25:56.630 align:start position:0%
was that was that
um 189

02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
um 189
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't remember which which was
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
the Croydon Bill and which wasn't I
 
02:26:10.610 --> 02:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
don't want to tell you the truth you
 
02:26:13.010 --> 02:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
know all I can remember is Kua and
 
02:26:15.050 --> 02:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
Montessori school and all that other we
 
02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
were discussing with creden wanting to
 
02:26:18.650 --> 02:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
tuition their kids out to those
 
02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:20.150 align:start position:0%
tuition their kids out to those
locations

02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
locations
 
02:26:21.770 --> 02:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
I can't remember which belt was
 
02:26:25.790 --> 02:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner but but we thought the
 
02:26:28.429 --> 02:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
result of this is that schools still
 
02:26:30.770 --> 02:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
that don't have public education can
 
02:26:32.929 --> 02:26:32.939 align:start position:0%
still Croydon can still contract with
 
02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
Newport if if they want to
 
02:26:37.849 --> 02:26:37.859 align:start position:0%
correct yeah they can um if I could
 
02:26:40.670 --> 02:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
expand they can correct they can
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
um contract with any school
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
for which they come to an agreement on
 
02:26:51.050 --> 02:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:52.969 --> 02:26:52.979 align:start position:0%
and the local board has responsibility
 
02:26:56.450 --> 02:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
for approving that yes
 
02:26:56.460 --> 02:26:58.490 align:start position:0%
for approving that yes
okay

02:26:58.490 --> 02:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
further questions of Representative
 
02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:02.630 align:start position:0%
further questions of Representative
cordelli

02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
02:27:05.450 --> 02:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
not seeing any and I have no more cards
 
02:27:07.309 --> 02:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
so guess what we're closing this so you
 
02:27:11.870 --> 02:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
got you got some more time for lunch
 
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:18.290 --> 02:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
you know this next bill starts at uh 12
 
02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:20.929 align:start position:0%
you know this next bill starts at uh 12
45.

02:27:20.929 --> 02:27:20.939 align:start position:0%
45.
 
02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the uh differentiated
 
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:43.370 --> 02:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
I thought that when we did the corn bill
 
02:27:45.050 --> 02:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
it wasn't that a Senate bill I don't
 
02:27:48.410 --> 02:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
know Senate bill yeah I can't remember I
 
02:27:49.969 --> 02:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
can't remember there's so many bills
 
02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:56.570 --> 02:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
I realize everybody's jumping up to
 
03:34:17.889 --> 03:34:17.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:25.969 --> 03:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:27.670 --> 03:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
I'll say
 
03:34:27.680 --> 03:34:29.530 align:start position:0%
I'll say
yes

03:35:21.290 --> 03:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
before we get started this afternoon I
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
would just like to make a note that
 
03:35:26.269 --> 03:35:26.279 align:start position:0%

and uh we have in our
 
03:35:36.950 --> 03:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
hearing here a note of Krista and those
 
03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
of us that knew her and worked with her

um on the it's a very special day for
 
03:35:45.889 --> 03:35:45.899 align:start position:0%
those of us who who knew her and uh
 
03:35:49.190 --> 03:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
when my son and I were down at the uh
 
03:35:52.130 --> 03:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
launching of the Challenger uh it was
 
03:35:54.889 --> 03:35:54.899 align:start position:0%
not the historic uh day that we thought
 
03:35:57.710 --> 03:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
we would see but uh it happened so I
 
03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:01.200 align:start position:0%

I don't think so I think I think uh
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the offering moment of
 
03:36:09.170 --> 03:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
silence but I do think that there's a
 
03:36:11.330 --> 03:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
those of us that were there
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
celebrate that each day in our own way
 
03:36:17.389 --> 03:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.969 --> 03:36:19.979 align:start position:0%
okay I guess we're about set to get
 
03:36:23.929 --> 03:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
started with our afternoon session and
 
03:36:27.250 --> 03:36:27.260 align:start position:0%
the first bill is House Bill 540
 
03:36:30.469 --> 03:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
relative to adequate educational grant
 
03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
amounts for pupils receiving special
 
03:36:34.370 --> 03:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
education services
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
and we welcome chairman Rick Ladd to
 
03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
present the bill
 
03:36:41.210 --> 03:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
03:36:42.769 --> 03:36:42.779 align:start position:0%
cordelli and members of the education
 
03:36:44.330 --> 03:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
committee I got my pink card right here
 
03:36:46.370 --> 03:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's all filled out so I'll hand it off
 
03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
when I come back up
 
03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce uh 540 as a
 
03:36:54.110 --> 03:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
bill relative to the adequate education
 
03:36:55.790 --> 03:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
grant amounts for pupils receiving
 
03:36:58.969 --> 03:36:58.979 align:start position:0%
special education services
 
03:37:00.469 --> 03:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
I come from a community which is very
 
03:37:07.150 --> 03:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
you know a community which is not a
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
wealthy community at all and we're we're
 
03:37:12.410 --> 03:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
looking at you know our base adequacy
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
and our differentiated Aid uh com amount
 
03:37:18.590 --> 03:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
that we get paid as are many districts
 
03:37:21.650 --> 03:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
throughout this state and I believe the
 
03:37:24.290 --> 03:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
amount for special education Aid in the
 
03:37:26.570 --> 03:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
area in the component differentiated aid
 
03:37:29.210 --> 03:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
for special ed is a little over two
 
03:37:30.889 --> 03:37:30.899 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per student two
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
thousand seventy nine dollars roughly in
 
03:37:34.150 --> 03:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
some odd sense
 
03:37:37.849 --> 03:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
and we provide that I've given you a
 
03:37:40.190 --> 03:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
packet here and unfortunately when they
 
03:37:42.190 --> 03:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
ran it off upstairs they
 
03:37:45.469 --> 03:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
ran both back in front and I asked him
 
03:37:47.750 --> 03:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
only run the front so we could have cut
 
03:37:50.090 --> 03:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
the paper in half and done it back to
 
03:37:52.429 --> 03:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
back but we've got so let's I'll try to
 
03:37:55.550 --> 03:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
challenge you to go through it with me
 
03:37:59.090 --> 03:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
um on page one there was a report that I
 
03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
had that was presented to me uh by our
 
03:38:06.050 --> 03:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
research staff months ago months ago and
 
03:38:07.429 --> 03:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
it's put together by the American
 
03:38:09.950 --> 03:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
institutes for research and we as a
 
03:38:14.690 --> 03:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
state have used air uh uh for looking at
 
03:38:17.389 --> 03:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
our grants and and our how we fund
 
03:38:19.070 --> 03:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
education and we had the study
 
03:38:20.450 --> 03:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
commission which we've looked at that
 
03:38:23.389 --> 03:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
and within this particular section of
 
03:38:26.450 --> 03:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
this report it looks at how we fund
 
03:38:28.370 --> 03:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
special education services in the
 
03:38:30.530 --> 03:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
schools and I underlined the first page
 
03:38:33.050 --> 03:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
seeing that even this report is older
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
but it still reflects that we have 13
 
03:38:38.210 --> 03:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
IEP categories you can look at them on
 
03:38:39.650 --> 03:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
the first page whereas the one on the
 
03:38:43.130 --> 03:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
bottom page and you can see them and
 
03:38:45.650 --> 03:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do or what this
 
03:38:47.510 --> 03:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
report was trying to do is try to
 
03:38:51.410 --> 03:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
identify are there certain uh categories
 
03:38:53.750 --> 03:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
which can be lumped together and
 
03:38:57.530 --> 03:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
weighted at a certain cost value and are
 
03:38:59.570 --> 03:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
there some other categories which
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
require more service time that are much
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
more complex do you wait at a different
 
03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
level than the first category and then
 
03:39:09.830 --> 03:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
you can also look at a number of other
 
03:39:12.170 --> 03:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
categories if you want to do that there
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
are a number of states let's go to the
 
03:39:16.250 --> 03:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
next page in this thing
 
03:39:19.849 --> 03:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
and before I I on page two you can see
 
03:39:21.650 --> 03:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
the reef this is just the report before
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
I get into what the other states do
 
03:39:28.490 --> 03:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
which reflects the number of of students
 
03:39:31.610 --> 03:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
in uh special education services in our
 
03:39:34.010 --> 03:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
state and this report here is and we've
 
03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
been handed it for 2022 there's 30 917
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
kids based upon these numbers here and
 
03:39:42.110 --> 03:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
you can see the categories to the left
 
03:39:44.389 --> 03:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
and explains them down below on the left
 
03:39:45.889 --> 03:39:45.899 align:start position:0%
hand side of the page
 
03:39:47.990 --> 03:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
and you can see also the total number of
 
03:39:50.090 --> 03:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
students throughout the state which are
 
03:39:52.670 --> 03:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
in these particular categories you can
 
03:39:55.490 --> 03:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
see some categories have a lot of
 
03:39:56.929 --> 03:39:56.939 align:start position:0%
students in them for example you're
 
03:39:58.969 --> 03:39:58.979 align:start position:0%
looking down specific learning uh
 
03:40:02.030 --> 03:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities and there's 10 000 plus
 
03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
students there whereas you can look at
 
03:40:06.290 --> 03:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
death and blindness
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
only 10. and that kind of reflective as
 
03:40:11.450 --> 03:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
you go back over the years here the next
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
sheet I put a couple and there's 2021 on
 
03:40:18.650 --> 03:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
page four it jumps to 2006 and I show
 
03:40:20.090 --> 03:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
you some other reports which we've
 
03:40:24.170 --> 03:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
gotten Beyond older than 2006 2004 and
 
03:40:24.180 --> 03:40:25.849 align:start position:0%
gotten Beyond older than 2006 2004 and
2002

03:40:25.849 --> 03:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
2002
 
03:40:28.429 --> 03:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
the difference repeat between this
 
03:40:30.410 --> 03:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
reporting and what you see reported now
 
03:40:32.410 --> 03:40:32.420 align:start position:0%
is we got information
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
prior from 2006 going backwards that
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
identified the types of programs which
 
03:40:40.010 --> 03:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
we had in the state whether it be
 
03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
home-based program individual non-school
 
03:40:45.229 --> 03:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
resource room program self-contained
 
03:40:47.870 --> 03:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
program modified rigor education program
 
03:40:52.309 --> 03:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
and we had the information down below
 
03:40:56.450 --> 03:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
whether it was presidential or day we
 
03:40:58.370 --> 03:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
had responsibility for placement who
 
03:41:00.050 --> 03:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
placed them in whether it was a parent a
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
court the district
 
03:41:04.250 --> 03:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
um that information used to be provided
 
03:41:07.130 --> 03:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
to us we don't have that now and part of
 
03:41:08.929 --> 03:41:08.939 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to see happen is we can
 
03:41:11.210 --> 03:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
start attaining this information so then
 
03:41:14.450 --> 03:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
on page nine
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
we can look at this data and see and I
 
03:41:18.830 --> 03:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
have underlined here all data reported
 
03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
and this is in the air report are for
 
03:41:25.849 --> 03:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
certain years uh 99 through 2000 but I
 
03:41:27.410 --> 03:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
haven't changed great section two shows
 
03:41:29.870 --> 03:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
how the total expenditure to educate a
 
03:41:31.969 --> 03:41:31.979 align:start position:0%
school age student with disability
 
03:41:33.710 --> 03:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
varies depending on the type of
 
03:41:36.830 --> 03:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
disability you go to the next page and
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
this starts to get into the weighted on
 
03:41:40.670 --> 03:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
page 10.
 
03:41:42.830 --> 03:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
and you can see that even though some of
 
03:41:44.269 --> 03:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
the disabilities are
 
03:41:47.030 --> 03:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
are not called the same as they are
 
03:41:50.090 --> 03:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
today we're still educating students
 
03:41:52.849 --> 03:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
which have similar handicapping or
 
03:41:52.859 --> 03:41:53.990 align:start position:0%
which have similar handicapping or
disabilities

03:41:53.990 --> 03:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
03:41:57.950 --> 03:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
and you can see that the uh as you get
 
03:42:00.830 --> 03:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
up along that Spectrum here visually
 
03:42:02.630 --> 03:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
impaired which will be the fourth one
 
03:42:05.570 --> 03:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
from the right how you can see that
 
03:42:07.309 --> 03:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
03:42:07.319 --> 03:42:08.530 align:start position:0%
compared to
um a

03:42:08.530 --> 03:42:08.540 align:start position:0%
um a
 
03:42:10.849 --> 03:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
learning disability a student learning
 
03:42:13.910 --> 03:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
disability on the far left hand side and
 
03:42:17.090 --> 03:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
the cost between the upper bound cost
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
and the lower bound costs are
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
significantly different we Fund in our
 
03:42:25.610 --> 03:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid every category the
 
03:42:25.620 --> 03:42:26.929 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid every category the
same

03:42:26.929 --> 03:42:26.939 align:start position:0%
same
 
03:42:29.630 --> 03:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
two thousand some odd dollars
 
03:42:31.729 --> 03:42:31.739 align:start position:0%
yet we know it takes a different amount
 
03:42:34.969 --> 03:42:34.979 align:start position:0%
of service to provide that student the
 
03:42:38.090 --> 03:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
needs that that student has and it takes
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
a in some cases real specialized medical
 
03:42:44.330 --> 03:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
understanding and how to work with these
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
students if they're deaf and blind it
 
03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
takes a real skill that you're not going
 
03:42:50.510 --> 03:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
to have from a classroom teacher of
 
03:42:53.229 --> 03:42:53.239 align:start position:0%
course and to get that type of training
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
even when you're in a postgraduate
 
03:43:00.290 --> 03:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
program is very costly and it's harder
 
03:43:01.309 --> 03:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
to find
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
than it is for example even if you look
 
03:43:05.570 --> 03:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
at if you go up where I was at the
 
03:43:07.610 --> 03:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
University of Maine when I checked out
 
03:43:09.769 --> 03:43:09.779 align:start position:0%
with my daughter not in too long ago how
 
03:43:11.090 --> 03:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
many slots you have for speech
 
03:43:12.769 --> 03:43:12.779 align:start position:0%
therapists up they had 25 slots
 
03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
available in their program manually for
 
03:43:17.690 --> 03:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
speech pathologists that is ridiculous
 
03:43:19.969 --> 03:43:19.979 align:start position:0%
when we know that we have such a high
 
03:43:23.690 --> 03:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
demand throughout our country
 
03:43:26.450 --> 03:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
going on to the next sheet so then I
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
asked our researcher back in September
 
03:43:31.849 --> 03:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
19th this is Jennifer 4 to do some
 
03:43:33.650 --> 03:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
research for search and find out okay
 
03:43:35.690 --> 03:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
multiple weights for special education
 
03:43:37.849 --> 03:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
funding which states are doing this and
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
which aren't
 
03:43:41.809 --> 03:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
most are doing a weighted formula of
 
03:43:42.830 --> 03:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
some kind
 
03:43:45.950 --> 03:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
and you can see that on the next sheet
 
03:43:49.490 --> 03:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
over which would be page 12 they took
 
03:43:52.309 --> 03:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
several States and and showed you how
 
03:43:53.929 --> 03:43:53.939 align:start position:0%
they're doing it
 
03:43:57.110 --> 03:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
um for example seven states has signed
 
03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
additional funding weights based on
 
03:44:01.429 --> 03:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
student disabilities and you can see for
 
03:44:04.670 --> 03:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
example Arizona has 11 categories
 
03:44:07.550 --> 03:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
George has 15.
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh Colorado too
 
03:44:13.210 --> 03:44:13.220 align:start position:0%
we have one
 
03:44:15.950 --> 03:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh next group down four states assign
 
03:44:17.570 --> 03:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
additional funding weights based on the
 
03:44:20.030 --> 03:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
number of hours of service provided for
 
03:44:23.150 --> 03:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
the level of service provided so some
 
03:44:26.330 --> 03:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
weight by the category some weight by
 
03:44:29.389 --> 03:44:29.399 align:start position:0%
the the time it takes to provide that
 
03:44:29.399 --> 03:44:30.349 align:start position:0%
the the time it takes to provide that
service

03:44:30.349 --> 03:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:44:32.630 --> 03:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
then you go down where you see Iowa and
 
03:44:34.969 --> 03:44:34.979 align:start position:0%
Texas two states assign additional
 
03:44:36.410 --> 03:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
funding weights based on student
 
03:44:36.420 --> 03:44:37.910 align:start position:0%
funding weights based on student
placement

03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
placement
 
03:44:39.769 --> 03:44:39.779 align:start position:0%
other words if you're placed in
 
03:44:41.389 --> 03:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
residential of course it's going to be a
 
03:44:43.250 --> 03:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
lot more than it's if you're placing
 
03:44:45.889 --> 03:44:45.899 align:start position:0%
within the traditional system
 
03:44:48.410 --> 03:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
and Indiana and Kentucky two states
 
03:44:50.269 --> 03:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
assign additional funding waste based on
 
03:44:54.290 --> 03:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
disability severity or incidence level
 
03:44:56.870 --> 03:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
Indiana and Kentucky one state assigns
 
03:44:58.309 --> 03:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
additional funding weights based on
 
03:45:00.590 --> 03:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
student cost Pennsylvania Pennsylvania
 
03:45:02.450 --> 03:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
has since been in real trouble with
 
03:45:04.729 --> 03:45:04.739 align:start position:0%
their funding formula they've had to
 
03:45:07.670 --> 03:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
read bake the whole thing we learned
 
03:45:09.229 --> 03:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
that through the commission study going
 
03:45:11.450 --> 03:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
on to page 13 I'm going to try to fly
 
03:45:12.530 --> 03:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
through here
 
03:45:14.630 --> 03:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
you can see on the bottom of this page
 
03:45:16.910 --> 03:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
how Georgia this one example that comes
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
from Georgia from the education
 
03:45:20.450 --> 03:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
Commission of the states I looked at a
 
03:45:22.010 --> 03:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
report from the education Commission in
 
03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
the state's only 39 States at that time
 
03:45:28.490 --> 03:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
were waiting out their formulas
 
03:45:31.010 --> 03:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
and so you can see category one two
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
three four five categories and you can
 
03:45:38.090 --> 03:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
read and see what types of uh needs are
 
03:45:40.729 --> 03:45:40.739 align:start position:0%
placed under like category three or a
 
03:45:44.690 --> 03:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:49.070 --> 03:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
so we introduced last year a bill
 
03:45:52.969 --> 03:45:52.979 align:start position:0%
as an amendment to SB 420 that's on page
 
03:45:55.849 --> 03:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
14. and the attempt to try and get
 
03:45:59.450 --> 03:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
weightedness into our education formula
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
was attempted and you can see on the
 
03:46:05.330 --> 03:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
back page on page 15 it shows how we
 
03:46:07.969 --> 03:46:07.979 align:start position:0%
added in here to the extraordinary needs
 
03:46:10.910 --> 03:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
Grant by way of an amendment that there
 
03:46:10.920 --> 03:46:11.809 align:start position:0%
Grant by way of an amendment that there
was

03:46:11.809 --> 03:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
the base cost of two thousand thirty
 
03:46:17.090 --> 03:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
seven dollars eleven cents and then we
 
03:46:21.050 --> 03:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
had category a and category B category a
 
03:46:23.570 --> 03:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
you can see included certain uh online
 
03:46:26.809 --> 03:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
23 going down through 29. you could see
 
03:46:29.870 --> 03:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
the the categories which were added
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
underneath category a and category B of
 
03:46:32.399 --> 03:46:34.130 align:start position:0%
underneath category a and category B of
service

03:46:34.130 --> 03:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
but then looking at that and working
 
03:46:38.990 --> 03:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
with folks and asking questions over at
 
03:46:42.889 --> 03:46:42.899 align:start position:0%
doe and through spokes such as uh Becky
 
03:46:44.210 --> 03:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
I don't know if Becky's here right now
 
03:46:45.530 --> 03:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
or not
 
03:46:47.830 --> 03:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
um Wilson that there are a lot of
 
03:46:50.510 --> 03:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
overlapping needs which are bouncing
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
they're multiple handicapping conditions
 
03:46:55.130 --> 03:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
and it was hard to and some of them even
 
03:46:56.870 --> 03:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
though it may have been speech and maybe
 
03:46:59.510 --> 03:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
the intensity of the speech in the IEP
 
03:47:02.030 --> 03:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
which demanded more time than a student
 
03:47:04.370 --> 03:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
that's just in there for his or her
 
03:47:07.550 --> 03:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
pronunciation of the letter R probably
 
03:47:13.070 --> 03:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
from Boston and so so I put aside that
 
03:47:16.190 --> 03:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
now and I've gone to page 16 here
 
03:47:18.229 --> 03:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
and looked at the individuals with
 
03:47:21.110 --> 03:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities Education Act idea Part B
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
what kind of information is reported to
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
the the feds and they there is one way
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
of doing this and that's based upon the
 
03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
time that the student is receiving
 
03:47:37.250 --> 03:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
service during the course of the day we
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
saw that as a possible weighted uh
 
03:47:41.630 --> 03:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
version that some other states are
 
03:47:43.070 --> 03:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
currently doing
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
and we know that there are some students
 
03:47:46.910 --> 03:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
which receive that service throughout
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
the course they especially some that are
 
03:47:51.849 --> 03:47:51.859 align:start position:0%
orthopedically handicapped or immobile
 
03:47:55.190 --> 03:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
we know oftentimes that those who are
 
03:47:58.070 --> 03:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
visually impaired same slows with
 
03:48:00.769 --> 03:48:00.779 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury require an
 
03:48:03.769 --> 03:48:03.779 align:start position:0%
intense amount of time and so what this
 
03:48:05.510 --> 03:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill does now
 
03:48:09.530 --> 03:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
you go on to page 17.
 
03:48:12.170 --> 03:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
this is how the LSR was presented that
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
was LSR 48 now it's hb4 540. the initial
 
03:48:19.969 --> 03:48:19.979 align:start position:0%
LSR replicated what we had in the
 
03:48:22.429 --> 03:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
previous Amendment last year
 
03:48:24.790 --> 03:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
this shows you where things were struck
 
03:48:28.370 --> 03:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
and it says now an additional twenty two
 
03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
thousand seventy nine dollars plus for
 
03:48:32.929 --> 03:48:32.939 align:start position:0%
each pupil and admr who is receiving
 
03:48:35.210 --> 03:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
special education services with a
 
03:48:36.830 --> 03:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
category a
 
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
they would receive the 2007 uh 79.89
 
03:48:45.370 --> 03:48:45.380 align:start position:0%
category B would receive 4
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
729.78 these are for and it'll explain
 
03:48:52.729 --> 03:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
down below for less for uh more than 80
 
03:48:54.410 --> 03:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
percent of the time that they're
 
03:48:56.750 --> 03:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
receiving that service the first
 
03:48:59.809 --> 03:48:59.819 align:start position:0%
category for B would be for Less
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
uh then then uh the category a applies
 
03:49:05.090 --> 03:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
to pupils receiving special education
 
03:49:08.450 --> 03:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
services for less than 80 percent of the
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
school day category B with if you
 
03:49:13.250 --> 03:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
receive a service more than eighty
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
percent of the day and category C
 
03:49:18.710 --> 03:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
applies to students uh that would
 
03:49:20.630 --> 03:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
receive special education services in
 
03:49:22.550 --> 03:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
separate schools residential facilities
 
03:49:25.610 --> 03:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
or homebound Hospital placements that
 
03:49:27.769 --> 03:49:27.779 align:start position:0%
technology that wording comes directly
 
03:49:30.710 --> 03:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
out of this data fact sheet as you can
 
03:49:32.690 --> 03:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
see right at the top going back to page
 
03:49:37.490 --> 03:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
16 uh under the idea it references in
 
03:49:39.469 --> 03:49:39.479 align:start position:0%
separate schools residential placements
 
03:49:42.769 --> 03:49:42.779 align:start position:0%
homebound slash Hospital placements so
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that child that we
 
03:49:47.870 --> 03:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
once called cat Aid now special
 
03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
education Aid so this does not suffice
 
03:49:53.090 --> 03:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
for the cat Aid or special aid but it
 
03:49:54.769 --> 03:49:54.779 align:start position:0%
increases the amount that's allocated
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
and in the differentiated Aid component
 
03:49:59.510 --> 03:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
from the two thousand dollars in the
 
03:50:03.410 --> 03:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
case of the student that is uh cat Aid
 
03:50:06.170 --> 03:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
or special Aid qualifying they would get
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
six thousand two hundred thirty nine
 
03:50:11.090 --> 03:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
dollars plus so the last sheet
 
03:50:13.130 --> 03:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
going through this quickly is how does
 
03:50:15.710 --> 03:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
this reflect on what we're or compared
 
03:50:19.309 --> 03:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
to what we're doing now on page 18
 
03:50:21.530 --> 03:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
for total projected special education
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
pupils is 30 309 students
 
03:50:27.410 --> 03:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
we know that in category a it's
 
03:50:29.929 --> 03:50:29.939 align:start position:0%
approximately 88.5 percent you'd see
 
03:50:31.849 --> 03:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
that number of students
 
03:50:35.349 --> 03:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
category b nine percent
 
03:50:39.229 --> 03:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
2728 students and category C 2.5 percent
 
03:50:42.110 --> 03:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
of the whole which would be 758 students
 
03:50:45.229 --> 03:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
you can see how that costs out with a b
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
c down below with a total of 73 million
 
03:50:48.239 --> 03:50:49.309 align:start position:0%
c down below with a total of 73 million
dollars

03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:50:51.110 --> 03:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh Plus
 
03:50:53.269 --> 03:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
compared to the current Formula if we
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
fund it all 30 000 students plus by the
 
03:50:58.670 --> 03:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
two thousand seventy nine dollars that
 
03:51:01.670 --> 03:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
comes up to 63 million dollars plus the
 
03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
difference is this would cost 10 million
 
03:51:05.690 --> 03:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
dollars to put this in effect
 
03:51:08.929 --> 03:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
roughly and so this is basically the
 
03:51:10.969 --> 03:51:10.979 align:start position:0%
concept of this this is similar to that
 
03:51:12.530 --> 03:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
it's been implemented in the state of
 
03:51:12.540 --> 03:51:14.210 align:start position:0%
it's been implemented in the state of
Washington

03:51:14.210 --> 03:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
Washington
 
03:51:18.290 --> 03:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
and let's see the next sheet
 
03:51:20.150 --> 03:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
oh I just put this in here because
 
03:51:23.210 --> 03:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we we discuss special
 
03:51:25.070 --> 03:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
education we ask what is an
 
03:51:27.349 --> 03:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
accommodation what is a modification in
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
the classroom simply put an
 
03:51:31.490 --> 03:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
accommodation of just how a student
 
03:51:34.910 --> 03:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
learns while a modification adjusts what
 
03:51:37.729 --> 03:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
they learn so oftentimes the students in
 
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
the class how they learn it we can
 
03:51:42.469 --> 03:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
modify that in the classroom while a
 
03:51:44.870 --> 03:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
modification adjusts what they learn you
 
03:51:48.349 --> 03:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
have to change and and you have to take
 
03:51:50.570 --> 03:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
into account the handicap capping
 
03:51:54.050 --> 03:51:54.060 align:start position:0%
condition to determine that one so that
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
closes my presentation on this bill I
 
03:51:58.670 --> 03:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
think it just explains to you that we're
 
03:52:01.729 --> 03:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
looking at a weighted formula for our
 
03:52:03.650 --> 03:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
differentiate Aid getting away the
 
03:52:05.870 --> 03:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
weighted formula concept was also
 
03:52:08.269 --> 03:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
introduced by the commission for
 
03:52:08.279 --> 03:52:08.870 align:start position:0%
introduced by the commission for
um

03:52:08.870 --> 03:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:11.630 --> 03:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
studying our our funding formula this is
 
03:52:13.729 --> 03:52:13.739 align:start position:0%
not the same waiting amount that waiting
 
03:52:17.389 --> 03:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
amount was 4.19 I believe times the base
 
03:52:17.399 --> 03:52:18.590 align:start position:0%
amount was 4.19 I believe times the base
amount

03:52:18.590 --> 03:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
amount
 
03:52:18.600 --> 03:52:19.729 align:start position:0%
amount
um

03:52:19.729 --> 03:52:19.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:22.130 --> 03:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
this this recommendation here somewhat
 
03:52:26.030 --> 03:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
based upon a what we have as possible
 
03:52:27.889 --> 03:52:27.899 align:start position:0%
available dollars I'll be honest with
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
that however it's also trying to say
 
03:52:32.150 --> 03:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
that there's certain categories which
 
03:52:34.910 --> 03:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
I've doubled the number each time to try
 
03:52:38.590 --> 03:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
to come at a factor or a number which
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
will definitely help us in in all our
 
03:52:43.010 --> 03:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
districts this is something which will
 
03:52:44.809 --> 03:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
be applicable to every District in the
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
state thank you
 
03:52:49.670 --> 03:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh questions for the
 
03:52:49.680 --> 03:52:52.550 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh questions for the
representative

03:52:52.550 --> 03:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:55.070 --> 03:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
great um yeah looks like you're going to
 
03:52:57.170 --> 03:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
get off easy yeah oh I'm sorry I'm ready
 
03:52:59.150 --> 03:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
to get out of here yeah representative
 
03:52:59.160 --> 03:53:00.710 align:start position:0%
to get out of here yeah representative
Cornell

03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
Cornell
 
03:53:02.210 --> 03:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:53:02.220 --> 03:53:02.929 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

03:53:02.929 --> 03:53:02.939 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:53:06.530 --> 03:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
um in the cap on the on the page where
 
03:53:09.410 --> 03:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
we can look up how people vote oppose or
 
03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
support the bill there was one letter
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
from from a parent whose son was um
 
03:53:18.170 --> 03:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
multiply handicapped I guess and and but
 
03:53:21.229 --> 03:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
they wanted him to be mainstreamed as
 
03:53:23.570 --> 03:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
much as possible to to gain from the
 
03:53:26.150 --> 03:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
class and whatever and I think the fear
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
was that instead of doing that if you
 
03:53:31.969 --> 03:53:31.979 align:start position:0%
would get more money by keeping the
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
student in a resource room or less
 
03:53:37.849 --> 03:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
mainstreaming to get the 80 there will
 
03:53:40.729 --> 03:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
be less inclination to try to include
 
03:53:43.250 --> 03:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
students into regular classes that's not
 
03:53:44.809 --> 03:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this in other words
 
03:53:46.190 --> 03:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a pair of with that
 
03:53:48.469 --> 03:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
person in the classroom I'm sure okay so
 
03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
that would come towards the 80 as far as
 
03:53:53.330 --> 03:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned yes uh that that is that
 
03:53:56.510 --> 03:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
is uh part of the IEP okay and it's
 
03:53:58.130 --> 03:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
being carried forward into the classroom
 
03:54:00.769 --> 03:54:00.779 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:54:03.889 --> 03:54:03.899 align:start position:0%
uh representative McDonald thank you and
 
03:54:06.410 --> 03:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you it's a really important issue
 
03:54:09.229 --> 03:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering on your written
 
03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
testimony page 17 you have crossed off
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
changes that you had from a previous
 
03:54:17.510 --> 03:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
idea one of which is listing a
 
03:54:19.490 --> 03:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
non-exhaustive list of specific
 
03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
diagnoses that may be included do you
 
03:54:25.429 --> 03:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
see a value as to maybe adding that in
 
03:54:26.929 --> 03:54:26.939 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
03:54:30.650 --> 03:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
how the bill 540 is currently voting for
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
just be non-ambiguous or is there just
 
03:54:35.570 --> 03:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
no added value to that if we were to go
 
03:54:37.849 --> 03:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
with the categories that you know we had
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the amendment last year which are
 
03:54:42.950 --> 03:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
those that you've like category a would
 
03:54:45.490 --> 03:54:45.500 align:start position:0%
have included developmental delay
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
specific learning disabilities which is
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
fairly common
 
03:54:52.969 --> 03:54:52.979 align:start position:0%
uh speech and language impairments
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
that category would receive the lesser
 
03:54:59.090 --> 03:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
of the the amount category B would apply
 
03:55:01.030 --> 03:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
to pupils receiving special services
 
03:55:03.769 --> 03:55:03.779 align:start position:0%
includes autism deaf and deafblindness
 
03:55:05.090 --> 03:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
emotional disturbance hearing
 
03:55:06.769 --> 03:55:06.779 align:start position:0%
impairments multiple disabilities and
 
03:55:08.809 --> 03:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
luxural disability and other health
 
03:55:10.849 --> 03:55:10.859 align:start position:0%
impairments for Orthopedic impairments
 
03:55:13.370 --> 03:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury acquired brain
 
03:55:16.010 --> 03:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
injury and visual impairments you can
 
03:55:18.229 --> 03:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
see that this category right here has
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
many of those categories which are going
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
to require more instructional time than
 
03:55:25.429 --> 03:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
a student has a learning disability in
 
03:55:27.530 --> 03:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
reading and gets that support from the
 
03:55:30.950 --> 03:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
teacher for reading and then is uh and
 
03:55:32.750 --> 03:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
probably can do that in the classroom as
 
03:55:35.990 --> 03:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
well or in some cases it needs to
 
03:55:37.849 --> 03:55:37.859 align:start position:0%
specialize in Mayco to a resource room
 
03:55:40.670 --> 03:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
for 45 minutes whatever the IP might
 
03:55:40.680 --> 03:55:43.130 align:start position:0%
for 45 minutes whatever the IP might
save

03:55:43.130 --> 03:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:45.170 --> 03:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
um that category right there the two
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
categories like this there's some
 
03:55:48.410 --> 03:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
blending though because oftentimes
 
03:55:51.490 --> 03:55:51.500 align:start position:0%
there's there's multiple issues between
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
and and if you were to ask me to really
 
03:55:57.769 --> 03:55:57.779 align:start position:0%
explain why those categories over here
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
versus these over here
 
03:56:01.969 --> 03:56:01.979 align:start position:0%
um I really couldn't give you that
 
03:56:04.130 --> 03:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
answer I have to rely upon people that
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
are like a Rebecca for that are those
 
03:56:08.450 --> 03:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
that are involved with this but I can
 
03:56:12.050 --> 03:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
tell you if we did this bill the way it
 
03:56:14.570 --> 03:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
was presented we'd be talking close to
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars okay 14 to 15 million
 
03:56:20.090 --> 03:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
dollars so it'd be an additional four or
 
03:56:22.309 --> 03:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
five million dollars to do it by these
 
03:56:24.530 --> 03:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
categories but then we'd have to really
 
03:56:26.809 --> 03:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
square away and say has representative
 
03:56:29.150 --> 03:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
Ladd gotten the categories correct are
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
there some other categories blonde
 
03:56:34.070 --> 03:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
category a or from A to B I'm not that
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
expert my background is I've worked in
 
03:56:39.889 --> 03:56:39.899 align:start position:0%
in schools we received awards for how we
 
03:56:42.170 --> 03:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
had intervention in our schools and how
 
03:56:43.790 --> 03:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
we ran our IEPs and providing the
 
03:56:46.130 --> 03:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
support I had all the specialists in my
 
03:56:47.809 --> 03:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
Elementary School everybody from a
 
03:56:49.670 --> 03:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
psychologist to speech pathologist
 
03:56:51.769 --> 03:56:51.779 align:start position:0%
physical therapists occupational
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
therapist I had it all and I was very
 
03:56:56.030 --> 03:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
fortunate we had Arco up the road paying
 
03:56:58.969 --> 03:56:58.979 align:start position:0%
the bill uh if we don't have that you
 
03:57:01.010 --> 03:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
know here so
 
03:57:03.590 --> 03:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I I would I would refer that back to
 
03:57:05.090 --> 03:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
the specials when it's a good question
 
03:57:07.670 --> 03:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
all right thank you question
 
03:57:10.370 --> 03:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
03:57:11.990 --> 03:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
um the other question that kind of came
 
03:57:14.570 --> 03:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
up on the uh online
 
03:57:17.929 --> 03:57:17.939 align:start position:0%
um submission was the the percentages
 
03:57:20.809 --> 03:57:20.819 align:start position:0%
and how they're determined and whether
 
03:57:24.590 --> 03:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
having an extended summer program where
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
they would be 100 in it would
 
03:57:29.990 --> 03:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
um put them in a different category and
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
again make it less uh a least
 
03:57:35.809 --> 03:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment kind of thing I
 
03:57:37.370 --> 03:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
went with the percentages simply because
 
03:57:40.790 --> 03:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
it is a format already under idea right
 
03:57:43.309 --> 03:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
so whether it's inclusive of your
 
03:57:45.889 --> 03:57:45.899 align:start position:0%
extended IEP which would take you
 
03:57:46.969 --> 03:57:46.979 align:start position:0%
through the summer because you don't
 
03:57:49.849 --> 03:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
want to see a lot of loss uh during the
 
03:57:52.189 --> 03:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
summer and I had that written in IEPs as
 
03:57:56.389 --> 03:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
well and that it takes extensive money
 
03:57:59.150 --> 03:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
we also had kids which were evaluated
 
03:58:01.370 --> 03:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
through the hospitals up in Anchorage
 
03:58:04.130 --> 03:58:04.140 align:start position:0%
for a neurological issues we had to flip
 
03:58:05.870 --> 03:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
that bill too back then because we
 
03:58:09.050 --> 03:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
weren't working closely with HHS and so
 
03:58:11.389 --> 03:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
there there are a number of issues which
 
03:58:13.250 --> 03:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed and that would be
 
03:58:15.290 --> 03:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
one I would I'm not going to assume
 
03:58:16.429 --> 03:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
anything I'm going to let you ask that
 
03:58:18.170 --> 03:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
question too you know how you
 
03:58:20.389 --> 03:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
incorporate those costs into this
 
03:58:24.050 --> 03:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
percentage okay thank you
 
03:58:26.030 --> 03:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
um for the questions
 
03:58:28.370 --> 03:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
um see none maybe I'll ask one
 
03:58:31.490 --> 03:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
um looking at the um weighted averages
 
03:58:35.929 --> 03:58:35.939 align:start position:0%
in other states I've seen concerns about
 
03:58:35.939 --> 03:58:36.710 align:start position:0%
in other states I've seen concerns about
um

03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:40.610 --> 03:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
the funding and the greater funding if
 
03:58:43.130 --> 03:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
they're spending more time outside of
 
03:58:45.130 --> 03:58:45.140 align:start position:0%
the regular classroom
 
03:58:49.610 --> 03:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
do you see any problem down the road in
 
03:58:54.590 --> 03:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
schools taking them out of the regular
 
03:58:58.010 --> 03:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
classroom and into a special ed class in
 
03:59:01.610 --> 03:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
order to receive the greater funding
 
03:59:03.650 --> 03:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
there may be always some manipulation
 
03:59:06.710 --> 03:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
within your how you you present a budget
 
03:59:09.170 --> 03:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
but I hope that's not the case I hope
 
03:59:12.590 --> 03:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is that right now
 
03:59:15.229 --> 03:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a truly an unfunded
 
03:59:18.469 --> 03:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
mandate and we're looking at
 
03:59:21.229 --> 03:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
we are required to provide the an
 
03:59:22.969 --> 03:59:22.979 align:start position:0%
appropriate service to all these
 
03:59:25.250 --> 03:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
students with an IEP
 
03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
I question if we're able to do that with
 
03:59:29.990 --> 03:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars
 
03:59:33.290 --> 03:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
uh per pupil it it just we can't even do
 
03:59:35.389 --> 03:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
it with six thousand dollars per pupil
 
03:59:37.969 --> 03:59:37.979 align:start position:0%
but we certainly can do it better with
 
03:59:41.870 --> 03:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
six than two and so I I guess I knew
 
03:59:43.309 --> 03:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
where I first learned about the weighted
 
03:59:46.490 --> 03:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
formula was when I saw the research from
 
03:59:49.370 --> 03:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
ECS years and years ago from Texas at
 
03:59:51.170 --> 03:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
that point in time they had more
 
03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
different categories than any other
 
03:59:54.830 --> 03:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
state in the country
 
03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
um so I would say that I'm doing this
 
04:00:00.050 --> 04:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
simply because yeah there could always
 
04:00:02.330 --> 04:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
be manipulation I hope not I hope
 
04:00:03.889 --> 04:00:03.899 align:start position:0%
there's good oversight
 
04:00:06.650 --> 04:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
but I I want to see that as being able
 
04:00:08.870 --> 04:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
to provide that service for districts
 
04:00:11.150 --> 04:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
that need the money to provide this
 
04:00:11.160 --> 04:00:13.490 align:start position:0%
that need the money to provide this
service

04:00:13.490 --> 04:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions
 
04:00:17.210 --> 04:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
04:00:21.050 --> 04:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
you very much representative Ladd for
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
putting this uh
 
04:00:26.330 --> 04:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
um keeping this uh this initiative going
 
04:00:28.010 --> 04:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
this was obviously something that I
 
04:00:30.590 --> 04:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
think was very supportive from the
 
04:00:32.929 --> 04:00:32.939 align:start position:0%
committee was very supportive of um uh
 
04:00:36.170 --> 04:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
last year and um and I also appreciate
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
the um the the change with respect to um
 
04:00:43.790 --> 04:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
hours of services as opposed to
 
04:00:47.450 --> 04:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
um categories but um my um
 
04:00:49.429 --> 04:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
my question actually goes the question
 
04:00:53.330 --> 04:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
actually goes to the last category C uh
 
04:00:55.250 --> 04:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
which is uh pupils receiving special
 
04:00:57.410 --> 04:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
education services in separate schools
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
residential facilities or homebound
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
Hospital placements that's sort of a
 
04:01:04.670 --> 04:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
category as opposed to a number of hours
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
and in a small District
 
04:01:10.250 --> 04:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
um is the is is the Department of
 
04:01:13.070 --> 04:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
Education going to be able to or for a
 
04:01:15.070 --> 04:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
small District going to be able to
 
04:01:18.410 --> 04:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
disclose uh that information which which
 
04:01:21.050 --> 04:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
presently I think you know for if the
 
04:01:23.110 --> 04:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
number of students is under 11
 
04:01:27.410 --> 04:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
that gets redacted on a district basis I
 
04:01:29.450 --> 04:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
think we we need to ask how they're
 
04:01:32.870 --> 04:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
doing they are doing it for example when
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
you have a child that moves in
 
04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
and is needing a residential placement
 
04:01:40.610 --> 04:01:40.620 align:start position:0%
that happens often like I mentioned to
 
04:01:42.110 --> 04:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
you the small town of Piermont where
 
04:01:43.670 --> 04:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
they had two come in the same year each
 
04:01:46.729 --> 04:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
one cost 250 000 plus they didn't have
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
the money and there is State money
 
04:01:51.769 --> 04:01:51.779 align:start position:0%
available for that so that is provided
 
04:01:55.729 --> 04:01:55.739 align:start position:0%
the year after the cost so that
 
04:01:57.410 --> 04:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
information is made available by
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
Paramount to the Department of Education
 
04:02:03.290 --> 04:02:03.300 align:start position:0%
we have this youngster based upon the
 
04:02:06.050 --> 04:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
IEP we have here where we have to have a
 
04:02:08.210 --> 04:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
residential placement now how that
 
04:02:12.050 --> 04:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
occurs in the goings on there I think
 
04:02:14.990 --> 04:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
that can be easily answered from the how
 
04:02:16.809 --> 04:02:16.819 align:start position:0%
they keep confidentiality and all that
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
that's why we have the Assassin's unique
 
04:02:22.790 --> 04:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
pupil identifier and all that right
 
04:02:26.389 --> 04:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
right no thank you and a follow-up so so
 
04:02:28.910 --> 04:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
um it's um it's it's not so much that
 
04:02:32.630 --> 04:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's that the Disclosure by the by the
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
department through through the funding
 
04:02:36.830 --> 04:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
formula item identifies the specific
 
04:02:41.090 --> 04:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
name or even assassin ID number of a
 
04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
student but in a small District
 
04:02:48.410 --> 04:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of um as I've been told people can
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
sort of determine or you know or may
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
have an idea who um who that student is
 
04:02:55.969 --> 04:02:55.979 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering what sort of
 
04:02:59.689 --> 04:02:59.699 align:start position:0%
protections I I you know in all reality
 
04:03:02.330 --> 04:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
pyrmont's a community of what 670 people
 
04:03:06.170 --> 04:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
the school has 67 kids in the school
 
04:03:06.180 --> 04:03:07.429 align:start position:0%
the school has 67 kids in the school
um

04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:10.269 --> 04:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
everybody knows all in that community
 
04:03:12.889 --> 04:03:12.899 align:start position:0%
and it's typical New Hampshire
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
so um how you get around that I don't
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
know if you ever will because that's
 
04:03:20.450 --> 04:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
just the culture of our state
 
04:03:23.150 --> 04:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
no thank you thank you very much yeah
 
04:03:25.130 --> 04:03:25.140 align:start position:0%

thank you representative cordelli my
 
04:03:56.929 --> 04:03:56.939 align:start position:0%
name is Rebecca Fredette I'm a state

director of special education I will

preface this with I can answer your
 
04:04:02.090 --> 04:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
questions related to special education
 
04:04:04.010 --> 04:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
but you will have to return refer to my
 
04:04:08.809 --> 04:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:10.610 --> 04:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner thank you and
 
04:04:12.830 --> 04:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming up for my question
 
04:04:15.710 --> 04:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
um I was concerned uh about the 80 how
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
the 80 percent
 
04:04:20.870 --> 04:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
um 40 you know the different percentages
 
04:04:24.290 --> 04:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
of of the child's involvement inclusion
 
04:04:26.330 --> 04:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
in the regular school how that's
 
04:04:28.790 --> 04:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
determined when you may have a student
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh who is included 80 during the regular
 
04:04:34.849 --> 04:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
school year but then goes on to the
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
Extended Learning over the summer uh and
 
04:04:41.450 --> 04:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
that's 100 percent and and would they
 
04:04:41.460 --> 04:04:43.429 align:start position:0%
that's 100 percent and and would they
then

04:04:43.429 --> 04:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
be disqualified for like
 
04:04:51.769 --> 04:04:51.779 align:start position:0%
be put in a non-inclusive situation when
 
04:04:53.570 --> 04:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
they were in the regular school year
 
04:04:55.610 --> 04:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:04:57.710 --> 04:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
um so the esy services are extended
 
04:04:58.969 --> 04:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
school year Services would not be
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
included within the determination for
 
04:05:02.389 --> 04:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment because
 
04:05:04.250 --> 04:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
that's what these calculations are or
 
04:05:07.309 --> 04:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
lre we just look at the so we have the
 
04:05:08.929 --> 04:05:08.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire special education
 
04:05:11.210 --> 04:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
information system and every District
 
04:05:13.729 --> 04:05:13.739 align:start position:0%
puts in they either write their complete
 
04:05:15.590 --> 04:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
IEP within that system or they put in
 
04:05:17.630 --> 04:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
the data that we need to calculate our
 
04:05:19.370 --> 04:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
indicators from the federal government
 
04:05:21.769 --> 04:05:21.779 align:start position:0%
and so lre is one of them and it looks
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
at the services that they have and what
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
setting they are in so are they in a
 
04:05:26.870 --> 04:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
regular education setting or special
 
04:05:29.090 --> 04:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
education setting or are they in a
 
04:05:30.710 --> 04:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
separate school and then it also looks
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
at and then determines the length of the
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
school day and come looks at those two
 
04:05:37.309 --> 04:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
numbers to say okay they're over 80 or
 
04:05:39.410 --> 04:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
they're under 80 or we've placed them in
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
a separate school so it looks directly
 
04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
at their individual IEPs to make that
 
04:05:43.199 --> 04:05:45.050 align:start position:0%
at their individual IEPs to make that
determination

04:05:45.050 --> 04:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
determination
 
04:05:45.060 --> 04:05:46.550 align:start position:0%
determination
oh

04:05:46.550 --> 04:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:05:49.189 --> 04:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
um do you have any fear that it's going
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
to create
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
um incentives or disincentives to move
 
04:05:57.050 --> 04:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh special ed students around in these
 
04:05:57.060 --> 04:05:58.370 align:start position:0%
uh special ed students around in these
percentages

04:05:58.370 --> 04:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
um it would be a concern but um we also
 
04:06:02.689 --> 04:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
have on the um other side of that
 
04:06:04.610 --> 04:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
through our state performance plan
 
04:06:07.490 --> 04:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
annual performance report or spp APR
 
04:06:08.630 --> 04:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
that we provide to the federal
 
04:06:10.610 --> 04:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
government each year we have a target
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
for where your lre should be for both um
 
04:06:17.510 --> 04:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
K through 12 and for preschool so we if
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
they were to go above that Target we
 
04:06:22.130 --> 04:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
would um it could trigger monitoring
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
with them and it would trigger us
 
04:06:25.130 --> 04:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
working with them through our indicator
 
04:06:26.990 --> 04:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring to say why is your number so
 
04:06:29.389 --> 04:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
high what what are your criteria for
 
04:06:32.150 --> 04:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
placing children in a more restrictive
 
04:06:34.849 --> 04:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
environment you know are you doing these
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
practices because you want more money
 
04:06:38.269 --> 04:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
for each student so we it it would be
 
04:06:40.010 --> 04:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
followed up with our monitoring process
 
04:06:41.929 --> 04:06:41.939 align:start position:0%
and we would be aware of that because of
 
04:06:43.849 --> 04:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
this bill and be able to say all right
 
04:06:45.469 --> 04:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
we need to go talk to this school or
 
04:06:46.969 --> 04:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
that school because their numbers
 
04:06:49.610 --> 04:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
haven't increased above our Target
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
you can't be able to yeah sorry would a
 
04:06:54.410 --> 04:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
parent be able to
 
04:06:56.210 --> 04:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
um question that as well the placement
 
04:06:59.389 --> 04:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
yes they can yep thank you further
 
04:07:02.090 --> 04:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
questions representative oh I'm sorry
 
04:07:05.570 --> 04:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank you and thank
 
04:07:07.610 --> 04:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
you representative for it as well I
 
04:07:09.290 --> 04:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
might ask this question a moment ago and
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
I just want to defer to you thank you
 
04:07:13.490 --> 04:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
for being here for taking the question
 
04:07:15.530 --> 04:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
would there be any added benefit to
 
04:07:15.540 --> 04:07:16.490 align:start position:0%
would there be any added benefit to
maybe

04:07:16.490 --> 04:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:07:20.590 --> 04:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:22.910 --> 04:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
diagnosis that might fit these
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
categories I know you can't possibly
 
04:07:26.150 --> 04:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
include all of them within the language
 
04:07:27.769 --> 04:07:27.779 align:start position:0%
of a bill but just to give more of a
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
guide to
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
school districts or to parents as to
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
what amount I guess what dollar amount
 
04:07:36.170 --> 04:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
their child would receive
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:07:38.809 --> 04:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
representative McDonnell
 
04:07:40.370 --> 04:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
um when the bill came up the last time
 
04:07:42.410 --> 04:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
it was presented that was the um
 
04:07:44.030 --> 04:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
consideration was to look at
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities and it's very difficult
 
04:07:48.290 --> 04:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
because you have a wide spectrum for
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
example if you have a child with a
 
04:07:51.769 --> 04:07:51.779 align:start position:0%
disability that's autism you could have
 
04:07:55.010 --> 04:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
a very low low functioning autistic
 
04:07:56.330 --> 04:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
child or you could have a very high
 
04:07:57.769 --> 04:07:57.779 align:start position:0%
functioning autistic child and they're
 
04:07:59.290 --> 04:07:59.300 align:start position:0%
going to have a variety of services
 
04:08:02.510 --> 04:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
based on what their needs are so just so
 
04:08:04.130 --> 04:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
to put autism in there for somebody
 
04:08:05.510 --> 04:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
who's high functioning they're really
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
not going to have as many costs as
 
04:08:09.650 --> 04:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
somebody who is more low functioning so
 
04:08:11.450 --> 04:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the that it made it
 
04:08:13.130 --> 04:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
difficult to try to say yes this is this
 
04:08:14.570 --> 04:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
one would cost more that one would cost
 
04:08:16.370 --> 04:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
more whereas this one I think is more
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
indicative of if you're not in the
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
classroom as much you you really do need
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
more services and if you're in a
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
separate School you really need a lot
 
04:08:25.790 --> 04:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
more services so it's it's as you need
 
04:08:27.410 --> 04:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
more services that price kind of
 
04:08:28.969 --> 04:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
increases for what you need to be able
 
04:08:30.769 --> 04:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
to pay for those supports all right that
 
04:08:33.229 --> 04:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
makes sense thank you you're welcome
 
04:08:38.450 --> 04:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:38.460 --> 04:08:43.729 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

04:08:43.729 --> 04:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:46.070 --> 04:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
as a person who spent almost all of an
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
attack Academic Year is a para to one of
 
04:08:51.469 --> 04:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
these students we're describing
 
04:08:54.349 --> 04:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you could comment on what
 
04:08:57.290 --> 04:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
kind of data there is on the I guess you
 
04:08:59.809 --> 04:08:59.819 align:start position:0%
call it outcomes of providing that kind
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
of support from an academic development
 
04:09:05.150 --> 04:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
of the student perspective
 
04:09:07.969 --> 04:09:07.979 align:start position:0%
so it's going again not to defer back to
 
04:09:09.290 --> 04:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
it's going to vary from student to
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
student it would be really on those
 
04:09:13.250 --> 04:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
annual progress reports that are done
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
for each student has the support of that
 
04:09:17.090 --> 04:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional provided them what they
 
04:09:18.889 --> 04:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
needed to be able to be successful have
 
04:09:20.330 --> 04:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
they met their goals that are in their
 
04:09:20.340 --> 04:09:21.769 align:start position:0%
they met their goals that are in their
IEP

04:09:21.769 --> 04:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
IEP
 
04:09:23.450 --> 04:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
um or they provided the supports that
 
04:09:25.729 --> 04:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
the team felt was necessary to ensure
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
that they were receiving free and
 
04:09:30.110 --> 04:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education
 
04:09:32.269 --> 04:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
so it goes back to that IEP and really
 
04:09:34.189 --> 04:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
the progress the student makes so and
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
that would be predicated on somebody's
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
assessment of their status at the
 
04:09:40.670 --> 04:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
beginning and yeah probably at the
 
04:09:42.590 --> 04:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
conclusion yep and the data they should
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
be collecting each quarter and Reporting
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
on to parents or trimester depending on
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
the school and so they should be
 
04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
collecting data around the students
 
04:09:51.349 --> 04:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
progress and how they're doing and be
 
04:09:53.570 --> 04:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
able to report that to the parents
 
04:09:56.570 --> 04:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome any further
 
04:09:56.580 --> 04:09:58.729 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome any further
questions

04:09:58.729 --> 04:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:10:01.309 --> 04:10:01.319 align:start position:0%
we've seen none thank you very much
 
04:10:01.319 --> 04:10:02.870 align:start position:0%
we've seen none thank you very much
and

04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:04.790 --> 04:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have any other cards is
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
was there anyone else who wanted to
 
04:10:07.610 --> 04:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
testify there was one from the
 
04:10:09.530 --> 04:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
um without a name
 
04:10:13.189 --> 04:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
04:10:13.199 --> 04:10:14.030 align:start position:0%
um but uh
um

04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:16.729 --> 04:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
seeing no one raising their
 
04:10:18.290 --> 04:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
raising their hand
 
04:10:18.300 --> 04:10:19.490 align:start position:0%
raising their hand
um

04:10:19.490 --> 04:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
we'll close this hearing and our next
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
hearing is in about 20 minutes
 
04:10:24.359 --> 04:13:48.349 align:start position:0%
hearing is in about 20 minutes
foreign

04:13:48.349 --> 04:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
which we've received from the Turkish
 
04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
Consulate in Boston regarding one of the
 
04:13:55.849 --> 04:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
bills which we've recently heard you all
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
got that because we had copies here as
 
04:14:00.670 --> 04:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
well you know
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
was it for everybody yeah well they they
 
04:14:05.389 --> 04:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
made sure they got a hold of every one
 
04:14:07.490 --> 04:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
of us then
 
04:14:09.889 --> 04:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
it's yeah it's got a good seal on it
 
04:14:11.590 --> 04:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:57.370 --> 04:32:57.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:59.809 --> 04:32:59.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh fellow
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record Glenn
 
04:33:03.970 --> 04:33:03.980 align:start position:0%
cordelli representing Tuftonboro
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro and Ossipee and uh
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
HB 530 is the result of the work of
 
04:33:18.070 --> 04:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
several people several groups
 
04:33:20.810 --> 04:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
trying to look at
 
04:33:24.609 --> 04:33:24.619 align:start position:0%
a fairness in relation to the
 
04:33:28.090 --> 04:33:28.100 align:start position:0%
withdrawal process and allowing
 
04:33:30.769 --> 04:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
districts to withdraw from a Cooperative
 
04:33:32.051 --> 04:33:32.061 align:start position:0%
School District
 
04:33:36.170 --> 04:33:36.180 align:start position:0%
as we've heard over the past term in a
 
04:33:38.090 --> 04:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
number of cases and we'll be hearing
 
04:33:42.551 --> 04:33:42.561 align:start position:0%
more I think again this year about it
 
04:33:46.131 --> 04:33:46.141 align:start position:0%
I think it's something like two times in
 
04:33:48.010 --> 04:33:48.020 align:start position:0%
the past 60 years
 
04:33:51.410 --> 04:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
a district has been able to withdraw
 
04:33:54.131 --> 04:33:54.141 align:start position:0%
from a Cooperative School District
 
04:33:57.529 --> 04:33:57.539 align:start position:0%
uh mainly because if a smaller School
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
District wants to uh wants to withdraw
 
04:34:03.890 --> 04:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
from a Cooperative District
 
04:34:06.051 --> 04:34:06.061 align:start position:0%
it requires the vote of the entire
 
04:34:07.730 --> 04:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District
 
04:34:10.750 --> 04:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
and in most cases
 
04:34:14.750 --> 04:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
the smaller District would be out voted
 
04:34:17.449 --> 04:34:17.459 align:start position:0%
by The Cooperative
 
04:34:23.590 --> 04:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
in this bill tries to address that with
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
a more fair We Believe approach in terms
 
04:34:30.650 --> 04:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
of the vote to withdraw
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
and um on the bottom of the first page
 
04:34:36.051 --> 04:34:36.061 align:start position:0%
basically on
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
um 15 on down you'll see three scenarios
 
04:34:43.369 --> 04:34:43.379 align:start position:0%
on line 15
 
04:34:46.010 --> 04:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
very simply if the majority of Voters
 
04:34:50.570 --> 04:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
voting in the pre-existing District want
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
to withdraw but vote against withdrawal
 
04:34:56.949 --> 04:34:56.959 align:start position:0%
then the process has ended
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
secondly going down the line from that
 
04:35:04.849 --> 04:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
if the voters and the district
 
04:35:08.090 --> 04:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
vote in favor withdrawal
 
04:35:10.131 --> 04:35:10.141 align:start position:0%
and the voters in The Cooperative
 
04:35:13.010 --> 04:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
District agree and also vote for
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawal of the smaller District the
 
04:35:18.830 --> 04:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:21.170 --> 04:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
and now the third scenario which is a
 
04:35:23.209 --> 04:35:23.219 align:start position:0%
new scenario
 
04:35:26.990 --> 04:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
if three-fifths of the voters voting in
 
04:35:30.890 --> 04:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
the district that wants to withdraw vote
 
04:35:33.189 --> 04:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
for withdrawal
 
04:35:37.131 --> 04:35:37.141 align:start position:0%
then they would be able to withdraw
 
04:35:37.141 --> 04:35:38.810 align:start position:0%
then they would be able to withdraw
unless

04:35:38.810 --> 04:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
unless
 
04:35:42.109 --> 04:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
a three-fifths majority of the voters in
 
04:35:45.769 --> 04:35:45.779 align:start position:0%
the entire Cooperative District vote
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
against withdrawal
 
04:35:50.810 --> 04:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
so it's trying to balance out
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
and present a fairer approach to the uh
 
04:35:59.929 --> 04:35:59.939 align:start position:0%
smaller District that might want to
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
withdraw from a Cooperative district and
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
their whole host of reasons why a
 
04:36:07.269 --> 04:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
district might want to withdraw
 
04:36:09.410 --> 04:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
there'll be other bills that we'll hear
 
04:36:12.830 --> 04:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
this this year that will address some of
 
04:36:14.090 --> 04:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
those instances
 
04:36:16.730 --> 04:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
but we believe that this
 
04:36:20.631 --> 04:36:20.641 align:start position:0%
will provide a greater opportunity for
 
04:36:23.029 --> 04:36:23.039 align:start position:0%
those districts who want to withdraw to
 
04:36:26.029 --> 04:36:26.039 align:start position:0%
have a chance to withdraw which they do
 
04:36:28.010 --> 04:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
not currently
 
04:36:31.310 --> 04:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
and I uh thank you and um I'm open to
 
04:36:31.320 --> 04:36:38.689 align:start position:0%
and I uh thank you and um I'm open to
questions

04:36:38.689 --> 04:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:36:44.769 --> 04:36:44.779 align:start position:0%
so if I understand this right
 
04:36:48.650 --> 04:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
uh on line 22
 
04:36:52.429 --> 04:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
there are two procedures that take place
 
04:36:56.510 --> 04:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
first would be the district within the
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
would have to have a three-fifths vote
 
04:37:05.090 --> 04:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
to indicate to the total Cooperative
 
04:37:07.490 --> 04:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
District that they want to withdraw is
 
04:37:09.769 --> 04:37:09.779 align:start position:0%
that correct that's the first step
 
04:37:12.170 --> 04:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
then the second step would be
 
04:37:16.010 --> 04:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
what if if the um three-fifths is a is
 
04:37:17.510 --> 04:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
an affirmative vote
 
04:37:20.449 --> 04:37:20.459 align:start position:0%
then there's a second vote of the total
 
04:37:20.459 --> 04:37:21.470 align:start position:0%
then there's a second vote of the total
District

04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
District
 
04:37:23.390 --> 04:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
that would have to have a three-fifths
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:26.400 --> 04:37:27.529 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:37:27.529 --> 04:37:27.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:30.410 --> 04:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
I was thinking it would be one vote
 
04:37:30.420 --> 04:37:31.970 align:start position:0%
I was thinking it would be one vote
and

04:37:31.970 --> 04:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:34.429 --> 04:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
the cat the
 
04:37:36.650 --> 04:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
um withdrawing District
 
04:37:39.170 --> 04:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
if their votes would be counted and then
 
04:37:41.570 --> 04:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
the entire vote uh for the Cooperative
 
04:37:43.849 --> 04:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
district recounted for the fifth
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
that that this this is confusing to me
 
04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
because I think how I read this and I
 
04:37:56.810 --> 04:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
may be wrong
 
04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
I read that the district Desiring to
 
04:38:00.719 --> 04:38:01.789 align:start position:0%
I read that the district Desiring to
leave

04:38:01.789 --> 04:38:01.799 align:start position:0%
leave
 
04:38:04.010 --> 04:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
would give notice through the
 
04:38:08.449 --> 04:38:08.459 align:start position:0%
Three-Fifths vote of that District alone
 
04:38:10.609 --> 04:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
to the total
 
04:38:14.470 --> 04:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
to the total uh Cooperative District
 
04:38:16.910 --> 04:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
that they want to leave and then the
 
04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
totals there'll be two votes that's how
 
04:38:21.170 --> 04:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
I view this I I mean maybe wrong that's
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
all yeah I'm trying to get clarification
 
04:38:27.529 --> 04:38:27.539 align:start position:0%
right I think that if the Three-Fifths
 
04:38:28.849 --> 04:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:38:31.730 --> 04:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
this drawing District vote for
 
04:38:31.740 --> 04:38:33.949 align:start position:0%
this drawing District vote for
withdrawal

04:38:33.949 --> 04:38:33.959 align:start position:0%
withdrawal
 
04:38:35.929 --> 04:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
that information would be sent to the
 
04:38:38.330 --> 04:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
clerk of the Cooperative school district
 
04:38:40.849 --> 04:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
and to the State Board of Education to
 
04:38:44.330 --> 04:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
certify the warrant and posting of
 
04:38:48.369 --> 04:38:48.379 align:start position:0%
minutes unless unless the Cooperative
 
04:38:50.810 --> 04:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
District votes
 
04:38:53.631 --> 04:38:53.641 align:start position:0%
in a three-fifths majority against the
 
04:38:53.641 --> 04:38:59.289 align:start position:0%
in a three-fifths majority against the
withdrawal

04:38:59.289 --> 04:38:59.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:03.650 --> 04:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
I think unless is a key word there in
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:09.230 --> 04:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
04:39:09.240 --> 04:39:10.189 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
woodcock

04:39:10.189 --> 04:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
04:39:12.349 --> 04:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
04:39:14.449 --> 04:39:14.459 align:start position:0%
um representatively uh think about the
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
fall of the same uh information that
 
04:39:19.730 --> 04:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
President Milo was as I read the line
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
26. I'm also confused because I read it
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
as a second vote because line 27 talks
 
04:39:28.429 --> 04:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
about the art in the end of 26 and the
 
04:39:31.010 --> 04:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
27 it talks about the entire Cooperative
 
04:39:34.730 --> 04:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
District vote whereas that where is 22
 
04:39:36.170 --> 04:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
only talks about those that are there
 
04:39:38.630 --> 04:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
for that particular vote it seems to me
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
that 22 is talking about those that come
 
04:39:42.530 --> 04:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
for the withdrawal vote
 
04:39:45.050 --> 04:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
and that that's affirmative because the
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
entire Cooperative District vote I mean
 
04:39:51.230 --> 04:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
I just that's all that's my confusion so
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I I believe the current process you
 
04:39:57.050 --> 04:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
know withdrawal vote irregardless of
 
04:39:59.150 --> 04:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
this new language with the Three-Fifths
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
I believe that it's a one vote process
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:08.990 --> 04:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you so the the three fifth year
 
04:40:11.288 --> 04:40:11.298 align:start position:0%
you're so your position is that this
 
04:40:16.490 --> 04:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
22-27 is still a singular vote Yes okay
 
04:40:20.510 --> 04:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Lucas
 
04:40:23.150 --> 04:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
yeah the whole process is laid out in
 
04:40:25.368 --> 04:40:25.378 align:start position:0%
the first part you can't take that
 
04:40:27.948 --> 04:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
second part separately and so it lays
 
04:40:31.010 --> 04:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
out how the plan is put in and okayed
 
04:40:33.770 --> 04:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
and all of that and then they call this
 
04:40:35.930 --> 04:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
election and it says what the election
 
04:40:37.490 --> 04:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
should say
 
04:40:39.230 --> 04:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
you know the school district accept
 
04:40:41.208 --> 04:40:41.218 align:start position:0%
their Provisions as men provided the
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
withdrawal of the pre-existing position
 
04:40:45.708 --> 04:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
of what from this Cooperative that gets
 
04:40:47.930 --> 04:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
put towards it for everybody in the dist
 
04:40:50.448 --> 04:40:50.458 align:start position:0%
in The Cooperative district and then
 
04:40:53.448 --> 04:40:53.458 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at the results of
 
04:40:56.448 --> 04:40:56.458 align:start position:0%
that vote is that if they're both
 
04:40:58.788 --> 04:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
negative if the first one is negative
 
04:41:01.010 --> 04:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
the if the little District that wants
 
04:41:03.410 --> 04:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
out is negative we end there
 
04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
if it's positive then we would go
 
04:41:08.270 --> 04:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
forward unless
 
04:41:10.670 --> 04:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
the whole vote is negative you know
 
04:41:12.050 --> 04:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
three-fifths of the whole vote is
 
04:41:14.208 --> 04:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
negative it's just laying out that what
 
04:41:15.530 --> 04:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
are the results of the vote we've
 
04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
tallied the vote and we look and see
 
04:41:19.788 --> 04:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
what it is and these are the things that
 
04:41:22.430 --> 04:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
happen based on the results of that vote
 
04:41:24.288 --> 04:41:24.298 align:start position:0%
but the whole first section lays out
 
04:41:26.270 --> 04:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
that vote
 
04:41:26.280 --> 04:41:27.010 align:start position:0%
that vote
um

04:41:27.010 --> 04:41:27.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:29.868 --> 04:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
if you're asking me a question about
 
04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:37.250 --> 04:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
um uh yes and I think lines 11 through
 
04:41:41.448 --> 04:41:41.458 align:start position:0%
14 lay out the form of the vote which is
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to point out as well
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
04:41:49.310 --> 04:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
04:41:50.930 --> 04:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:41:52.670 --> 04:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
um forgive that I did not have time to
 
04:41:59.030 --> 04:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
research this but are there other rsas
 
04:42:01.850 --> 04:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
or somewhere that it is spelled out
 
04:42:04.250 --> 04:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
in a withdrawal plan from a Cooperative
 
04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
District that they have to have looked
 
04:42:06.718 --> 04:42:07.610 align:start position:0%
District that they have to have looked
at

04:42:07.610 --> 04:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:42:11.150 --> 04:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
all the impacts financial and otherwise
 
04:42:14.270 --> 04:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
in I would parallel it perhaps
 
04:42:18.288 --> 04:42:18.298 align:start position:0%
to when a community leaves an SAU
 
04:42:21.470 --> 04:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
it has to not be detrimental to
 
04:42:24.350 --> 04:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
the any of the resulting entities is
 
04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
there something like that in RSA yes
 
04:42:26.400 --> 04:42:27.350 align:start position:0%
there something like that in RSA yes
there's

04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:42:27.360 --> 04:42:28.150 align:start position:0%
there's
um

04:42:28.150 --> 04:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:32.590 --> 04:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
extensive language in this chapter
 
04:42:36.128 --> 04:42:36.138 align:start position:0%
related to the withdrawal process and
 
04:42:40.850 --> 04:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
the dissolution of assets etc for any
 
04:42:43.850 --> 04:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
withdrawal process this is just the
 
04:42:45.770 --> 04:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
section on the vote itself
 
04:42:47.810 --> 04:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
04:42:47.820 --> 04:42:49.430 align:start position:0%
oh yes
so

04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:42:52.128 --> 04:42:52.138 align:start position:0%
in that extensive process has the state
 
04:42:56.628 --> 04:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
board or doe approved the idea of a
 
04:42:58.190 --> 04:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
community withdrawing from The
 
04:43:04.750 --> 04:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:08.330 --> 04:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
as you see in line two if the State
 
04:43:12.650 --> 04:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
I think where we're going to have to go
 
04:43:17.090 --> 04:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
on this is that for those of us sat on
 
04:43:19.490 --> 04:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
this committee last year
 
04:43:23.448 --> 04:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
we went through extensive extensive
 
04:43:25.550 --> 04:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
um discussion regarding how to get out
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
of a cooperative
 
04:43:29.930 --> 04:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
School District it's like a divorce and
 
04:43:32.750 --> 04:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to even get that and
 
04:43:34.070 --> 04:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we have some people here
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to speak on
 
04:43:36.410 --> 04:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
that they're coming from the Carroll
 
04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
area which I'm familiar with what's
 
04:43:39.650 --> 04:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
going on up there or what's what's
 
04:43:42.350 --> 04:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
happened but there I think what we will
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
have to do is do what we're doing with
 
04:43:46.250 --> 04:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
some of the other bills have a little
 
04:43:48.890 --> 04:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
presentation on this whole process so
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
those that are new to the committee
 
04:43:53.930 --> 04:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
which is half of you need to have an
 
04:43:55.490 --> 04:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
understanding of what is the process
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
currently on the books for how you get
 
04:43:59.330 --> 04:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
out of a Cooperative School District
 
04:44:00.530 --> 04:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
because there's a whole lot of
 
04:44:02.990 --> 04:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
information which you need to know you
 
04:44:06.770 --> 04:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
know that that that the the all that so
 
04:44:09.410 --> 04:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh with that um any other questions for
 
04:44:11.208 --> 04:44:11.218 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
if I could comment
 
04:44:15.670 --> 04:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
um one thing this was not
 
04:44:18.530 --> 04:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
developed with any particular
 
04:44:23.770 --> 04:44:23.780 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District or any town in mind
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
I had a question from the Press about
 
04:44:32.050 --> 04:44:32.060 align:start position:0%
that but this was developed as a generic
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
withdrawal vote solution
 
04:44:38.448 --> 04:44:38.458 align:start position:0%
similar to many of the what we did last
 
04:44:39.890 --> 04:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
year we tried to bring up a lot of
 
04:44:41.930 --> 04:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
scenarios like this
 
04:44:45.350 --> 04:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
hit a lot of dead end roads yes uh let
 
04:44:48.530 --> 04:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
me ask question so you talked about I'm
 
04:44:50.570 --> 04:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
I mean last going back to last year we
 
04:44:52.788 --> 04:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
had talked about having a you know
 
04:44:55.490 --> 04:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
committee and really diving into this
 
04:44:58.190 --> 04:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
and and um in a different way and you
 
04:45:00.230 --> 04:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
spoke about several groups that had
 
04:45:01.610 --> 04:45:01.620 align:start position:0%
worked on this I was wondering if you
 
04:45:03.050 --> 04:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
could tell us what some of those groups
 
04:45:03.060 --> 04:45:06.288 align:start position:0%
could tell us what some of those groups
were

04:45:06.288 --> 04:45:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.650 --> 04:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh there were some other Representatives
 
04:45:13.128 --> 04:45:13.138 align:start position:0%
um and a collection of uh people from uh
 
04:45:15.830 --> 04:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
up north not a group in particular but a
 
04:45:19.128 --> 04:45:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:20.690 --> 04:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
further questions of Representative
 
04:45:20.700 --> 04:45:21.890 align:start position:0%
further questions of Representative
cordelli

04:45:21.890 --> 04:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
04:45:24.530 --> 04:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:45:44.750 --> 04:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:44.760 --> 04:45:46.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:45:46.990 --> 04:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:49.070 --> 04:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay there you go
 
04:45:51.050 --> 04:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
and the appointed representative from
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%

04:46:01.970 --> 04:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
1963.
 
04:46:03.650 --> 04:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
we asked to get a new apportionment
 
04:46:08.230 --> 04:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
formula in 1988 2004 and
 
04:46:11.810 --> 04:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
2021-22 the Board of Ed
 
04:46:14.530 --> 04:46:14.540 align:start position:0%
voted against putting it on the ballot
 
04:46:17.090 --> 04:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
2022 we had to go to the State Board of
 
04:46:19.670 --> 04:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
Ed to get our withdrawal article on the
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
ballot because the SAU said no
 
04:46:25.610 --> 04:46:25.620 align:start position:0%
a member of the State Board of Ed said
 
04:46:27.190 --> 04:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
we were stuck in the hotel California
 
04:46:30.770 --> 04:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
you check in but you can't check out
 
04:46:33.590 --> 04:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
the Board of Ed did put the warrant but
 
04:46:35.690 --> 04:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
under the they showed the impact on each

04:46:49.128 --> 04:46:49.138 align:start position:0%
economic assumptions and demographics
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
have changed we have six percent of the
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
students and pay 26 percent of the
 
04:46:56.448 --> 04:46:56.458 align:start position:0%

04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
in 2021 the SAU agreed to have a member

from each members of the board and
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
Selectmen to try to redo the
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
reapportionment formula Carol proposed
 
04:47:11.330 --> 04:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
changing it five percent a year for four
 
04:47:11.340 --> 04:47:12.530 align:start position:0%
changing it five percent a year for four
years

04:47:12.530 --> 04:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:47:15.830 --> 04:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
from 60 percent per student 40 valuation
 
04:47:19.490 --> 04:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
to 80 percent student and 20 percent
 
04:47:22.850 --> 04:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
over four years denied this made Carol
 
04:47:24.590 --> 04:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
seek to withdraw we didn't want to leave
 
04:47:26.448 --> 04:47:26.458 align:start position:0%
the district things were going to get
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
worse with our new revaluation
 
04:47:31.368 --> 04:47:31.378 align:start position:0%
the district is made up of Five Towns
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
Carol has the smallest number of
 
04:47:34.610 --> 04:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
students and voters
 
04:47:37.788 --> 04:47:37.798 align:start position:0%
at the time this was done 21 students

1701 based on 21 enrollment each town
 
04:48:02.810 --> 04:48:02.820 align:start position:0%
has a representative to the board except
 
04:48:05.628 --> 04:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
for Lancaster and Wakefield have two
 
04:48:07.128 --> 04:48:07.138 align:start position:0%
they do not want to come up with
 
04:48:09.170 --> 04:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
anything that would lower Carol's cost
 
04:48:12.410 --> 04:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
and raise others Cal pays more than 50
 
04:48:15.410 --> 04:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
000 per student not County Education tax
 
04:48:19.310 --> 04:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
the tuition for UNH it's 15 500 for
 
04:48:22.490 --> 04:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
residents and 34.40. for non-residents
 
04:48:24.770 --> 04:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
something is wrong when we pay more to
 
04:48:27.128 --> 04:48:27.138 align:start position:0%
educate K through 12.
 
04:48:29.590 --> 04:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
Lancaster pays 7
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
590 I believe Carol is one of the
 
04:48:35.930 --> 04:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
highest in the state and Lancaster's one
 
04:48:38.090 --> 04:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
of the lowest in the state
 
04:48:42.650 --> 04:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
in 2020 Lancaster got over 3 million in
 
04:48:45.170 --> 04:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
state funds Carol nothing the total for
 
04:48:48.170 --> 04:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
the SAU 36 was over 6 million none of
 
04:48:50.690 --> 04:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
which went to Carroll certainly within
 
04:48:52.970 --> 04:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
the same SAU this is wrong
 
04:48:55.368 --> 04:48:55.378 align:start position:0%
we have asked to leave three times over
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
35 years
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
in 1988 Carol paid 47.99 per student and
 
04:49:04.670 --> 04:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
Lancaster was 1783. that was two and a
 
04:49:06.530 --> 04:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
half times more now it is six and a half
 
04:49:07.850 --> 04:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
times more
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
things are getting worse and will
 
04:49:11.150 --> 04:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
continue to get worse unless something
 
04:49:12.530 --> 04:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
is done
 
04:49:14.810 --> 04:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
Carol has tried to negotiate but we have
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
been out voted by the boa and the voting
 
04:49:20.330 --> 04:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
booth Cal has just reevaluated the worst
 
04:49:22.850 --> 04:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
year possible and town-wide increased 64
 
04:49:22.860 --> 04:49:24.288 align:start position:0%
year possible and town-wide increased 64
percent

04:49:24.288 --> 04:49:24.298 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:49:26.150 --> 04:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
we do support the bill but believe it
 
04:49:28.430 --> 04:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
does not go far enough Carol does
 
04:49:31.208 --> 04:49:31.218 align:start position:0%
support it based on our last attempt to
 
04:49:33.708 --> 04:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
withdraw the results in that vote we
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
would still be stuck in the hotel
 
04:49:38.570 --> 04:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
California it was like uh 75 percent of
 
04:49:42.170 --> 04:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
Carroll voters voted to withdraw in 75
 
04:49:44.930 --> 04:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
76 percent district-wide voted that we
 
04:49:44.940 --> 04:49:49.610 align:start position:0%
76 percent district-wide voted that we
couldn't

04:49:49.610 --> 04:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:52.250 --> 04:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
um there's a great place the essay you
 
04:49:53.628 --> 04:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
had asked us to come back to the table
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
about changing the formula but after
 
04:49:58.550 --> 04:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
Carol lost its state appeal they voted
 
04:50:00.770 --> 04:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
to end the meetings account should have
 
04:50:03.410 --> 04:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
more control over its student population
 
04:50:05.690 --> 04:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
where they attend
 
04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
SAU 36 was created 60 years ago and much
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.190 --> 04:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:19.368 --> 04:50:19.378 align:start position:0%
so you have articles of agreement can
 
04:50:21.310 --> 04:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
you go through one more time and tell me
 
04:50:23.810 --> 04:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
how many reps on the Cooperative board
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
Carol has Dalton house Jefferson
 
04:50:28.368 --> 04:50:28.378 align:start position:0%
Lancaster and Whitefield right field and
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
Lancaster have two the others to each
 
04:50:32.390 --> 04:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
through each the other three towns have
 
04:50:35.868 --> 04:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
one each okay one one and one
 
04:50:39.170 --> 04:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
so those two towns they control the vote
 
04:50:42.170 --> 04:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
they have the most students
 
04:50:44.448 --> 04:50:44.458 align:start position:0%
and pay the least amount
 
04:50:47.030 --> 04:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
and one other question in the Articles
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
of agreement how did they establish the
 
04:50:53.390 --> 04:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
the the cot your share for uh for pupil
 
04:50:55.850 --> 04:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
costs is that based on uh average daily
 
04:50:59.208 --> 04:50:59.218 align:start position:0%
membership or on valuation of property
 
04:51:02.090 --> 04:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
um it's 60 percent 60 percent of the
 
04:51:05.330 --> 04:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
charge is they call it ADM students 40
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
is valuation
 
04:51:09.770 --> 04:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
we do have a high evaluation because we
 
04:51:13.070 --> 04:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
have 400 homes that are non-resident
 
04:51:17.208 --> 04:51:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
is there any effort upon your your your
 
04:51:23.690 --> 04:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
school district to shrink it from let's
 
04:51:27.830 --> 04:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
say 60 ADM to maybe 50 40 and put the
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
added burden on on the valuation side
 
04:51:33.410 --> 04:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
which would increase your costs
 
04:51:35.570 --> 04:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh they said the default number for that
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
is 50 50 which would increase our costs
 
04:51:40.430 --> 04:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
and they didn't proceed with that we
 
04:51:43.190 --> 04:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
were asking it to go from 60 40
 
04:51:46.128 --> 04:51:46.138 align:start position:0%
to 80 20 over four years five percent
 
04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
shift a year so it's not to impact all
 
04:51:51.288 --> 04:51:51.298 align:start position:0%
at once and one last question for you if
 
04:51:55.070 --> 04:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
they went to this 50 50 would your cost
 
04:51:56.990 --> 04:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
per pupil jump up around eighty thousand
 
04:51:57.000 --> 04:51:58.490 align:start position:0%
per pupil jump up around eighty thousand
dollars

04:51:58.490 --> 04:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:52:01.010 --> 04:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
I never calculated that all I know is
 
04:52:01.020 --> 04:52:02.030 align:start position:0%
I never calculated that all I know is
between

04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
um what we give the district and what we
 
04:52:05.750 --> 04:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
give the state is 70 000 a student now
 
04:52:05.760 --> 04:52:08.330 align:start position:0%
give the state is 70 000 a student now
yeah

04:52:08.330 --> 04:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:52:16.128 --> 04:52:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:24.190 --> 04:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:26.570 --> 04:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:52:29.208 --> 04:52:29.218 align:start position:0%
committee I um Erica Leon a state
 
04:52:31.610 --> 04:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
representative from Derry the only
 
04:52:33.770 --> 04:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
single towned Cooperative School
 
04:52:35.690 --> 04:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
District in the state this actually
 
04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
dates back to 1959 where we had gotten
 
04:52:41.390 --> 04:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
down to only two school districts within
 
04:52:43.368 --> 04:52:43.378 align:start position:0%
the town of Derry I believe we were at
 
04:52:45.350 --> 04:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
14 at some point around the turn of the
 
04:52:47.448 --> 04:52:47.458 align:start position:0%
last century when they built Hood school
 
04:52:49.610 --> 04:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
they took those two districts and turned
 
04:52:51.530 --> 04:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
into a Cooperative school district and
 
04:52:53.208 --> 04:52:53.218 align:start position:0%
so we had been a one-town Cooperative
 
04:52:55.310 --> 04:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
School District ever since that worked
 
04:52:56.810 --> 04:52:56.820 align:start position:0%
very well for the town of Derry when
 
04:52:58.430 --> 04:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
school building Aid was different for
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts so they
 
04:53:01.430 --> 04:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep it and they wanted to
 
04:53:03.590 --> 04:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
leave that unchanged the laws have
 
04:53:06.110 --> 04:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
changed around that so that now there's
 
04:53:08.208 --> 04:53:08.218 align:start position:0%
no benefit and there's only hassle for
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
dairy to stay in Cooperative School
 
04:53:12.650 --> 04:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
District however we're in this strange
 
04:53:14.690 --> 04:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
Hotel California where there's no way
 
04:53:16.070 --> 04:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
for us to dissolve our school district
 
04:53:18.310 --> 04:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
and go into a local school district
 
04:53:21.890 --> 04:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
I am coming to you today asking I have
 
04:53:23.868 --> 04:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
some language that may work but probably
 
04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
is not the right language to also add
 
04:53:28.730 --> 04:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
some way that would allow a single
 
04:53:31.128 --> 04:53:31.138 align:start position:0%
municipality Cooperative School District
 
04:53:33.708 --> 04:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
to hold a vote to dissolve the
 
04:53:35.570 --> 04:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
cooperative and become a local school
 
04:53:38.868 --> 04:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
district that would make our lives much
 
04:53:42.010 --> 04:53:42.020 align:start position:0%
easier our current superintendent
 
04:53:44.510 --> 04:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
is interested in looking further into
 
04:53:46.430 --> 04:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
the process to see what happens and many
 
04:53:47.868 --> 04:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
members of the school board and fiscal
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
advisory committee also would like to
 
04:53:52.010 --> 04:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
find explore becoming a local school
 
04:53:54.650 --> 04:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
district rather than adding the 93rd
 
04:53:56.868 --> 04:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
Bill to your committee this year this
 
04:53:59.570 --> 04:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
seems like a very small one town issue
 
04:54:02.930 --> 04:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
that I would appreciate as you have the
 
04:54:04.190 --> 04:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
work session and learn more about
 
04:54:06.590 --> 04:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
Cooperative dissolution if this would
 
04:54:08.270 --> 04:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
fit into this or any of your other bills
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful for the town of
 
04:54:12.110 --> 04:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
Derry to actually have an option to turn
 
04:54:14.090 --> 04:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
from Cooperative to local at some point
 
04:54:16.250 --> 04:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
so I can hand this out and I'm ready for
 
04:54:17.868 --> 04:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you representative
 
04:54:20.930 --> 04:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:54:23.930 --> 04:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
question could you uh give us um some
 
04:54:25.850 --> 04:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
idea of what are the hassles and what
 
04:54:27.770 --> 04:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
are the benefits of being a Cooperative
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
School District a one-town Cooperative
 
04:54:31.250 --> 04:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
School District
 
04:54:32.690 --> 04:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
um thank you there's just thank you for
 
04:54:33.770 --> 04:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
the question there's just a lot of
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
confusion around it people don't
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
understand it and if they're so busy
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out why we're
 
04:54:38.400 --> 04:54:39.708 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out why we're
Cooperative

04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
Cooperative
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
um they think that that's because
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton is part of our school district
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
but Pinkerton is actually its own SAU
 
04:54:47.990 --> 04:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
and there's there's just a lot of
 
04:54:49.610 --> 04:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
confusion about what it is people are
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
following the local school district laws
 
04:54:53.150 --> 04:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
and trying to go in with those and
 
04:54:54.770 --> 04:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on
 
04:54:57.530 --> 04:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
but as a single Town's Cooperative
 
04:54:59.930 --> 04:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
School District were ruled by The
 
04:55:01.310 --> 04:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District laws but
 
04:55:02.690 --> 04:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
there's no apportionment because it's
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
all one town so it's just it just makes
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
it a lot harder to investigate and
 
04:55:08.750 --> 04:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
figure out what actually is going on and
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
how to do things correctly
 
04:55:13.490 --> 04:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:55:16.250 --> 04:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
yes represent McDonald thank you for
 
04:55:18.770 --> 04:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
being here and thank you Mr chair do you
 
04:55:20.990 --> 04:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
know of anyone may be anecdotally and
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
Barry who would want to remain in the
 
04:55:24.530 --> 04:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
Cooperative are there benefits as to
 
04:55:26.930 --> 04:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
doing that as a Singleton thank you for
 
04:55:28.250 --> 04:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
the question when the school building
 
04:55:30.110 --> 04:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
Aid formula was different than there was
 
04:55:32.628 --> 04:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
a significant benefit that's why I'd be
 
04:55:34.490 --> 04:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
looking to do this as a warrant article
 
04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
so it goes before the voters asking to
 
04:55:38.390 --> 04:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
just change it here and the legislature
 
04:55:40.430 --> 04:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense even if it should
 
04:55:42.830 --> 04:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
most likely be a clear choice for the
 
04:55:44.330 --> 04:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
voters of dairy
 
04:55:46.610 --> 04:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
um just giving us a process to be able
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
to vote our way out of it would be would
 
04:55:50.090 --> 04:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
be a very nice option so thank you for
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:54.890 --> 04:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
04:55:57.410 --> 04:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
most of our Cooperative districts have
 
04:55:59.930 --> 04:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
Cooperative agreements articles of
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
agreement we know several do not
 
04:56:05.830 --> 04:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
are your members uh in your Cooperative
 
04:56:10.250 --> 04:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
voted at large or are they uh
 
04:56:14.410 --> 04:56:14.420 align:start position:0%
for example I too am in a once one town
 
04:56:16.910 --> 04:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District Haverhill
 
04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
Cooperative is one town
 
04:56:23.690 --> 04:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
so we all ours are at large members what
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
do you have in your Cooperative
 
04:56:27.170 --> 04:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and the
 
04:56:28.610 --> 04:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
information I didn't realize you were
 
04:56:31.070 --> 04:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
also a single Town Cooperative we are
 
04:56:32.930 --> 04:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
also all at large members we have seven
 
04:56:36.530 --> 04:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
members on the rotating three-year basis
 
04:56:38.810 --> 04:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
was at one point in time there another
 
04:56:41.930 --> 04:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
District within your town which may have
 
04:56:43.850 --> 04:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
cost that original Cooperative School
 
04:56:46.250 --> 04:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
District as happened in April
 
04:56:48.948 --> 04:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
um yes back around 1900 there were 14
 
04:56:50.810 --> 04:56:50.820 align:start position:0%
different school districts within Derry
 
04:56:53.230 --> 04:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
they Consolidated down to two around
 
04:56:57.288 --> 04:56:57.298 align:start position:0%
1959 Hood had their dairy farm in Dairy
 
04:56:59.750 --> 04:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
and they donated land to build the
 
04:57:02.208 --> 04:57:02.218 align:start position:0%
Gilbert Hood middle school and the
 
04:57:03.530 --> 04:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
elementary school that's on the same
 
04:57:05.750 --> 04:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
location and as they did that it was
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
bringing all the students into one area
 
04:57:09.530 --> 04:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
so it had to become one district and the
 
04:57:11.810 --> 04:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
way they did that was as a cooperative
 
04:57:13.550 --> 04:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
I think there are several districts that
 
04:57:15.770 --> 04:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
did that further questions
 
04:57:17.868 --> 04:57:17.878 align:start position:0%
yes represent Tanner
 
04:57:20.270 --> 04:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you so you have a number of
 
04:57:23.208 --> 04:57:23.218 align:start position:0%
elementary schools in in Derry
 
04:57:26.990 --> 04:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and if you're if you create withdraw
 
04:57:29.270 --> 04:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
from The Cooperative does that split the
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
elementary schools up into different
 
04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
districts or
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question we wouldn't
 
04:57:38.330 --> 04:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
want to split in back into the two
 
04:57:40.128 --> 04:57:40.138 align:start position:0%
districts we'd simply want to go from
 
04:57:42.590 --> 04:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
being the only interest in Dairy is to
 
04:57:44.208 --> 04:57:44.218 align:start position:0%
go from being a Cooperative to a local
 
04:57:45.830 --> 04:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
school district so that when people are
 
04:57:47.690 --> 04:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what to do they say
 
04:57:49.490 --> 04:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
dairy's one town I'm looking at the
 
04:57:52.010 --> 04:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
local school district laws they would
 
04:57:53.448 --> 04:57:53.458 align:start position:0%
actually know where they're going I
 
04:57:54.708 --> 04:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
don't think that it would change any of
 
04:57:56.330 --> 04:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
the elementary schools and as far as
 
04:57:57.650 --> 04:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
that goes there's already a discussion
 
04:58:00.530 --> 04:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
in town about whether they would build a
 
04:58:02.030 --> 04:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
single Elementary School that would
 
04:58:03.770 --> 04:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
serve more of the students and close
 
04:58:06.650 --> 04:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
some and as you'd be as you probably
 
04:58:08.150 --> 04:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
would not be surprised there's a lot of
 
04:58:10.190 --> 04:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
contention over that but that's a local
 
04:58:10.200 --> 04:58:12.110 align:start position:0%
contention over that but that's a local
issue

04:58:12.110 --> 04:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:58:13.788 --> 04:58:13.798 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:58:16.610 --> 04:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you and
 
04:58:18.288 --> 04:58:18.298 align:start position:0%
another card which we have on this bill
 
04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
530 is bear Christina from the school
 
04:58:31.450 --> 04:58:31.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:31.460 --> 04:58:33.708 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:58:33.708 --> 04:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:58:35.628 --> 04:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Ladd good afternoon
 
04:58:37.730 --> 04:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
members of the committee bear Christina
 
04:58:39.110 --> 04:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire school boards
 
04:58:42.530 --> 04:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
Association I'm from the get-go excuse
 
04:58:44.330 --> 04:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
me um we're not taking a position on
 
04:58:46.910 --> 04:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
this bill specifically
 
04:58:49.128 --> 04:58:49.138 align:start position:0%
um I think the work that representative
 
04:58:52.368 --> 04:58:52.378 align:start position:0%
cordelli put into the bill reaches um I
 
04:58:53.990 --> 04:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
think a reasonable compromise with some
 
04:58:55.250 --> 04:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
of the discussions that we've had in
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
this room going back the last I'd say
 
04:58:58.850 --> 04:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
five or six years relative to the
 
04:59:01.430 --> 04:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
withdrawal aspects for Cooperative
 
04:59:04.128 --> 04:59:04.138 align:start position:0%
school districts the three-fifth super
 
04:59:06.590 --> 04:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
majority I think is a is a is a
 
04:59:08.448 --> 04:59:08.458 align:start position:0%
reasonable Safeguard
 
04:59:09.890 --> 04:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
um for the you know for the community
 
04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
that's looking to withdrawal but also
 
04:59:12.890 --> 04:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
you have sort of the other Safeguard
 
04:59:16.070 --> 04:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
where um a three-fifths majority Co-op
 
04:59:19.310 --> 04:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
wide would have to have to um have to
 
04:59:21.350 --> 04:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
oppose it so I don't have any specific
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
reasons for
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
um opposing the bill
 
04:59:26.330 --> 04:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we I mean we I don't
 
04:59:27.708 --> 04:59:27.718 align:start position:0%
know want to go so far as to say we
 
04:59:30.530 --> 04:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
support it because nhsba's position
 
04:59:32.330 --> 04:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
um for some of the newer members and the
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
older members are going to get to
 
04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
committee repeating myself I still think
 
04:59:37.788 --> 04:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
that we need a two year long study
 
04:59:40.970 --> 04:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
commission to study RSA 195 and it's in
 
04:59:44.390 --> 04:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
its totality even if we amend the um the
 
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
withdrawal process to make it
 
04:59:48.550 --> 04:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
um easier or a little bit more balanced
 
04:59:51.230 --> 04:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me um you know we still have
 
04:59:53.030 --> 04:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
remaining questions about the divvying
 
04:59:55.310 --> 04:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
up of assets and the dissolution of the
 
04:59:58.128 --> 04:59:58.138 align:start position:0%
assets and who owes what upon withdrawal
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
and who gets the books and the and who
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
owns the building and things of that
 
05:00:03.288 --> 05:00:03.298 align:start position:0%
nature so
 
05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
um the the proposed bill I think is is a
 
05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
is is a reasonable compromise to some of
 
05:00:09.830 --> 05:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
the proposals that we've had coming
 
05:00:11.690 --> 05:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
across this committee the last couple of
 
05:00:14.330 --> 05:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
years but we still think studying the
 
05:00:16.970 --> 05:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
the totality of the of the statute um
 
05:00:19.250 --> 05:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
makes the most sense so with that I'm
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
happy to happy to answer any questions
 
05:00:26.090 --> 05:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:29.448 --> 05:00:29.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:32.690 --> 05:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
are there any other cards on 5 30 or any
 
05:00:34.670 --> 05:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
of the others who want to speak on it
 
05:00:36.050 --> 05:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close this
 
05:00:36.060 --> 05:00:50.230 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close this
hearing

05:00:50.230 --> 05:00:50.240 align:start position:0%

for the next bill which is House Bill
 
05:34:42.650 --> 05:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
466 relative to water bottle filling
 
05:34:46.070 --> 05:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
stations in schools and uh chairman
 
05:34:48.530 --> 05:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
ricklette is ready to introduce the Bill
 
05:34:50.628 --> 05:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the record my
 
05:34:52.670 --> 05:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
name is representative Rick Ladd I come
 
05:34:54.050 --> 05:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
from Haverhill the Haverhill New
 
05:34:56.270 --> 05:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at the Haverhill Massachusetts
 
05:34:59.330 --> 05:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
and uh here to introduce this bill about
 
05:35:01.490 --> 05:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
water bottle filling stations in our
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
schools as you'll note this is a very
 
05:35:05.930 --> 05:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
short bill has four lines in it
 
05:35:08.690 --> 05:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
and what it does it subtracts the
 
05:35:10.670 --> 05:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
eliminates deletes the rule making
 
05:35:13.368 --> 05:35:13.378 align:start position:0%
process necessary that's associated with
 
05:35:14.868 --> 05:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
the bottle filling stations which we
 
05:35:16.850 --> 05:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
pill uh in the schools which we passed
 
05:35:18.050 --> 05:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:35:20.090 --> 05:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
basically what the issue is that there
 
05:35:20.100 --> 05:35:20.868 align:start position:0%
basically what the issue is that there
is

05:35:20.868 --> 05:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:35:23.208 --> 05:35:23.218 align:start position:0%
um there's no need for rule making all
 
05:35:25.850 --> 05:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
they have all the doe has to do is ditto
 
05:35:28.368 --> 05:35:28.378 align:start position:0%
what is in this bill here it's similar
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
to when we passed legislation for
 
05:35:32.868 --> 05:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
embedding mathematics into the fourth
 
05:35:35.330 --> 05:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
course at the high schools we never had
 
05:35:37.190 --> 05:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
rulemaking for that all we did is take
 
05:35:39.170 --> 05:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
the statutory language and that's the
 
05:35:40.788 --> 05:35:40.798 align:start position:0%
guidance all the guidance that the
 
05:35:43.190 --> 05:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
department needs and it's all that the
 
05:35:46.250 --> 05:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
school districts need as well so
 
05:35:48.110 --> 05:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
um the department feels that there's no
 
05:35:50.770 --> 05:35:50.780 align:start position:0%
need for these this rulemaking I concur
 
05:35:53.208 --> 05:35:53.218 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see where we don't have to
 
05:35:56.570 --> 05:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
Pat make more rules and so with that I
 
05:35:59.270 --> 05:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
will conclude my testimony thank you
 
05:36:02.230 --> 05:36:02.240 align:start position:0%

filling stations and new construction
 
05:36:15.708 --> 05:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
and all of that stands it's just the
 
05:36:18.110 --> 05:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
rule making part of it that is going
 
05:36:20.990 --> 05:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
away and all the policy Remains the Same
 
05:36:23.090 --> 05:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
nothing in the policy that we passed
 
05:36:27.288 --> 05:36:27.298 align:start position:0%

05:39:54.560 --> 05:39:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
17-0

05:39:56.390 --> 05:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
17-0
 
05:39:58.910 --> 05:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
um is everybody fine with the consent
 
05:40:05.390 --> 05:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:08.690 --> 05:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
okay now I have received from a member
 
05:40:11.510 --> 05:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee for reconsideration
 
05:40:15.230 --> 05:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
um on a bill which dealt with the
 
05:40:17.390 --> 05:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
the statutory books which we receive
 
05:40:17.400 --> 05:40:18.890 align:start position:0%
the statutory books which we receive
here

05:40:18.890 --> 05:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:40:22.070 --> 05:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
um so we do not have to declare an exit
 
05:40:24.830 --> 05:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
we can just continue now reconsideration
 
05:40:28.010 --> 05:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
we can take action or if if you would
 
05:40:30.470 --> 05:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
like if you're not prepared and you're
 
05:40:30.480 --> 05:40:31.788 align:start position:0%
like if you're not prepared and you're
prepared

05:40:31.788 --> 05:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
05:40:31.798 --> 05:40:32.570 align:start position:0%
prepared
um

05:40:32.570 --> 05:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:34.368 --> 05:40:34.378 align:start position:0%
are we prepared from a clerical
 
05:40:37.430 --> 05:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
positions knowing how you okay uh we'll
 
05:40:45.850 --> 05:40:45.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:48.170 --> 05:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
well that's right
 
05:40:50.030 --> 05:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
okay so all I'm going to do is just give
 
05:40:51.708 --> 05:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
you a notice that we will be executing
 
05:40:55.730 --> 05:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
this bill at our next exec we cannot do
 
05:40:57.830 --> 05:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
it willy-nilly like we did in the past
 
05:40:57.840 --> 05:41:01.090 align:start position:0%
it willy-nilly like we did in the past
years

05:41:01.090 --> 05:41:01.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:03.650 --> 05:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
this is the book Bill we're going to
 
05:41:05.930 --> 05:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
have to do it when we have a day notice
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
for executive sessions that we can pop
 
05:41:09.948 --> 05:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
it on and we can take care of it so we
 
05:41:13.490 --> 05:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
won't be doing it now this one's okay so
 
05:41:15.410 --> 05:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
the first one yeah the first one we can
 
05:41:16.910 --> 05:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
do it because that's immediately
 
05:41:20.030 --> 05:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
following the bill we just took up so we
 
05:41:22.030 --> 05:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
can do that
 
05:41:26.090 --> 05:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:29.390 --> 05:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
it's that crazy rule
 
05:41:31.970 --> 05:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
okay so what we are we're at uh so we're
 
05:41:33.590 --> 05:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
at a recess until we have to do the next
 
05:41:33.600 --> 05:41:34.810 align:start position:0%
at a recess until we have to do the next
bill

05:41:34.810 --> 05:41:34.820 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:41:38.990 --> 05:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
at 3 15 another 20 minutes from now
 
05:55:01.310 --> 05:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:04.310 --> 05:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
yeah but before we start out any further
 
05:55:07.010 --> 05:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
I want to say what we just did with 466
 
05:55:08.530 --> 05:55:08.540 align:start position:0%
we can't do
 
05:55:12.288 --> 05:55:12.298 align:start position:0%
and and the reason for that we used to
 
05:55:14.390 --> 05:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
be able to exec bills immediately
 
05:55:16.310 --> 05:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
following the hearing of a bill and just
 
05:55:18.350 --> 05:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
even though this bill was such a simple
 
05:55:20.448 --> 05:55:20.458 align:start position:0%
thing done in about two to three minutes
 
05:55:22.430 --> 05:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
the whole thing hearing an exact session
 
05:55:26.090 --> 05:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
on water filling stations we we just
 
05:55:28.490 --> 05:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
can't do it we have to and and the
 
05:55:30.590 --> 05:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
reason for that any bill that we have
 
05:55:32.868 --> 05:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
already scheduled for an executive
 
05:55:36.770 --> 05:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
session in the future you cannot exec
 
05:55:40.788 --> 05:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
any earlier than that however so and and
 
05:55:42.830 --> 05:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
even though we had agreement between the
 
05:55:46.250 --> 05:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
ranking member and my myself on what we
 
05:55:48.470 --> 05:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
did and we had a unanimous Road 17 zip
 
05:55:50.628 --> 05:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
we can't do it so we're gonna have to
 
05:55:52.190 --> 05:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
wait and come back and take another two
 
05:55:54.288 --> 05:55:54.298 align:start position:0%
or three minutes on a day we have
 
05:55:57.708 --> 05:55:57.718 align:start position:0%
exacting our bills so so what we did is
 
05:56:00.048 --> 05:56:00.058 align:start position:0%
kind of Moot and it's not going to have
 
05:56:02.330 --> 05:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
any bearing on what we did so we just
 
05:56:04.250 --> 05:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
have to replicate our efforts at a later
 
05:56:04.260 --> 05:56:06.110 align:start position:0%
have to replicate our efforts at a later
date

05:56:06.110 --> 05:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
date
 
05:56:08.090 --> 05:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
and it was a dry run for the clerk thank
 
05:56:09.708 --> 05:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
05:56:09.718 --> 06:01:51.288 align:start position:0%
you for your
understanding

06:01:51.288 --> 06:01:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:53.628 --> 06:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go ahead uh we're
 
06:01:56.090 --> 06:01:56.100 align:start position:0%
ready for the next bill it's 4 40. it's
 
06:01:59.090 --> 06:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
relative to the education trust fund and
 
06:02:01.850 --> 06:02:01.860 align:start position:0%
represent Glenn cardelli is the sponsor
 
06:02:03.650 --> 06:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
he's ready to go
 
06:02:05.330 --> 06:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:02:08.270 --> 06:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh for the record again Glenn
 
06:02:09.970 --> 06:02:09.980 align:start position:0%
cordelli representing Tuftonboro
 
06:02:14.150 --> 06:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro and Ossipee and uh this is
 
06:02:16.390 --> 06:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 440
 
06:02:18.590 --> 06:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
relative to the uses of the education
 
06:02:20.030 --> 06:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
06:02:24.530 --> 06:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
and it updates RSA 198
 
06:02:28.610 --> 06:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
39 which established the education trust
 
06:02:32.590 --> 06:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
fund and is used to define its uses
 
06:02:34.750 --> 06:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
over time
 
06:02:36.530 --> 06:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
we had
 
06:02:39.170 --> 06:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
things to the statutes and maybe don't
 
06:02:43.190 --> 06:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
cover all the bases and in a number of
 
06:02:47.510 --> 06:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
cases one base that has been missed is
 
06:02:50.868 --> 06:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund statute and its
 
06:02:50.878 --> 06:02:52.310 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund statute and its
uses

06:02:52.310 --> 06:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
uses
 
06:02:57.948 --> 06:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
this bill adds into that statute uses
 
06:03:00.048 --> 06:03:00.058 align:start position:0%
for the trust fund that have been
 
06:03:02.510 --> 06:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
defined elsewhere in statute
 
06:03:07.070 --> 06:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
but should probably be added to this uh
 
06:03:10.610 --> 06:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
section of law as well and that's the
 
06:03:13.670 --> 06:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill in working with the
 
06:03:15.670 --> 06:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to identify
 
06:03:19.548 --> 06:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
those areas of law that need to be
 
06:03:21.708 --> 06:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
reflected here
 
06:03:21.718 --> 06:03:22.368 align:start position:0%
reflected here
um

06:03:22.368 --> 06:03:22.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:25.670 --> 06:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
I handed out earlier if you have it a
 
06:03:28.730 --> 06:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
sheet that underlines certain sections
 
06:03:28.740 --> 06:03:29.868 align:start position:0%
sheet that underlines certain sections
certain

06:03:29.868 --> 06:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
certain
 
06:03:33.010 --> 06:03:33.020 align:start position:0%
um phrases in the
 
06:03:37.970 --> 06:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
statute to those reflect the additions
 
06:03:42.230 --> 06:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
to 198.39 this was drafted as a repeal
 
06:03:45.948 --> 06:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
and reenactment so they didn't capture
 
06:03:49.070 --> 06:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
or highlight the additions up to the
 
06:03:51.170 --> 06:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
bill so I tried to underline them for
 
06:03:54.470 --> 06:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
you in working with the Department
 
06:03:57.708 --> 06:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
um but as you go down certain things are
 
06:04:00.350 --> 06:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
added for instance on line eight to
 
06:04:02.030 --> 06:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
distribute kindergarten grants to
 
06:04:03.650 --> 06:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
municipalities and school districts
 
06:04:06.670 --> 06:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 198.48c
 
06:04:10.010 --> 06:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
down in a line
 
06:04:10.020 --> 06:04:11.510 align:start position:0%
down in a line
um

06:04:11.510 --> 06:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:14.990 --> 06:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
15 distribute grants for at least space
 
06:04:17.030 --> 06:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
to approve charter schools pursuant to
 
06:04:21.170 --> 06:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
198 15 HH these are all things that have
 
06:04:24.288 --> 06:04:24.298 align:start position:0%
been placed in statute they are law
 
06:04:24.298 --> 06:04:25.670 align:start position:0%
been placed in statute they are law
but

06:04:25.670 --> 06:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:04:28.430 --> 06:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
and they are allowable uses of the
 
06:04:31.070 --> 06:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
education trust fund pursuant to those
 
06:04:34.190 --> 06:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
statutes but should probably be
 
06:04:37.970 --> 06:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
reflected also in this um section of Law
 
06:04:41.208 --> 06:04:41.218 align:start position:0%
related to the uses of the trust fund so
 
06:04:44.990 --> 06:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
this tries to clarify that and clean up
 
06:04:48.830 --> 06:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
those sections of law that do utilize
 
06:04:51.230 --> 06:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund so that in this
 
06:04:54.110 --> 06:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
one section of law you get a full
 
06:04:56.270 --> 06:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
picture of what is coming out of the
 
06:04:58.910 --> 06:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
06:05:02.930 --> 06:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and that is the purpose of this bill
 
06:05:05.448 --> 06:05:05.458 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for your time
 
06:05:06.948 --> 06:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
are there any questions of the
 
06:05:08.628 --> 06:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
representative representative Tanner and
 
06:05:10.910 --> 06:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
then representative leckis thank you I
 
06:05:12.288 --> 06:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
think um
 
06:05:15.410 --> 06:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
one of the important issues in this is
 
06:05:19.010 --> 06:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
that in that Preamble it says that's uh
 
06:05:20.868 --> 06:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
money's in such fund shall not be used
 
06:05:23.208 --> 06:05:23.218 align:start position:0%
for any purpose other than to distribute
 
06:05:24.890 --> 06:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
adequate education grants to
 
06:05:27.410 --> 06:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
municipality schools districts and to
 
06:05:29.288 --> 06:05:29.298 align:start position:0%
approve of charter schools pursuant to
 
06:05:32.510 --> 06:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
198 uh colon 42 and then with some other
 
06:05:34.850 --> 06:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
things isn't there a lawsuit that's
 
06:05:37.670 --> 06:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
currently currently being uh worked
 
06:05:39.350 --> 06:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
through the courts on this particular
 
06:05:41.628 --> 06:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
issue and if it is
 
06:05:44.208 --> 06:05:44.218 align:start position:0%
um should we vote on this
 
06:05:46.730 --> 06:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
in lieu of the fact that it's already in
 
06:05:48.470 --> 06:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
06:05:51.048 --> 06:05:51.058 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we should delay
 
06:05:54.548 --> 06:05:54.558 align:start position:0%
legislation to clean up our statutes
 
06:05:57.890 --> 06:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
based on any pending lawsuit I don't
 
06:06:00.890 --> 06:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
think it really impacts the lawsuit at
 
06:06:00.900 --> 06:06:02.110 align:start position:0%
think it really impacts the lawsuit at
all

06:06:02.110 --> 06:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:06:06.048 --> 06:06:06.058 align:start position:0%
so there could always be a lawsuit
 
06:06:09.170 --> 06:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
hanging over us in terms of pending
 
06:06:12.350 --> 06:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
legislation so I don't see any reason to
 
06:06:17.810 --> 06:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:19.610 --> 06:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
06:06:21.470 --> 06:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative leckis
 
06:06:23.868 --> 06:06:23.878 align:start position:0%
thank you this is another one of those
 
06:06:25.970 --> 06:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
just to make it clear
 
06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure what you're saying
 
06:06:32.750 --> 06:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
is that all of these things are already
 
06:06:35.570 --> 06:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
passed in law and already say will be
 
06:06:38.750 --> 06:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
drawn from the education trust fund
 
06:06:41.448 --> 06:06:41.458 align:start position:0%
and so all we're doing is
 
06:06:44.868 --> 06:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
listing under education trust fund all
 
06:06:46.730 --> 06:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
the things that we've already passed and
 
06:06:48.948 --> 06:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
said can be drawn from the education
 
06:06:51.590 --> 06:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
trust fund is that correct and that is
 
06:06:53.650 --> 06:06:53.660 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying and I think
 
06:06:56.090 --> 06:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
if you choose you will hear from the
 
06:06:59.930 --> 06:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
education department to verify that
 
06:07:02.750 --> 06:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Woodcock thank
 
06:07:06.470 --> 06:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
you chairman uh representative thank you
 
06:07:08.330 --> 06:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
very similar to representative's
 
06:07:10.490 --> 06:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
question where were these paid out of
 
06:07:13.190 --> 06:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
prior to this they
 
06:07:15.230 --> 06:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question they are all
 
06:07:17.628 --> 06:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
are already paid out of the education
 
06:07:19.970 --> 06:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
trust fund because in uh for instance
 
06:07:23.690 --> 06:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
198 15 HH it says it is to be taken from
 
06:07:26.628 --> 06:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund but when that
 
06:07:29.510 --> 06:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
statute was passed that law was passed
 
06:07:31.850 --> 06:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
um they didn't go back and put it into
 
06:07:34.190 --> 06:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
this section of law so that is what
 
06:07:36.788 --> 06:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here okay yes sir
 
06:07:39.830 --> 06:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so just for clarity every one
 
06:07:43.670 --> 06:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
of these uh uh statutes that represent
 
06:07:45.110 --> 06:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
Lucas just spoke about everyone's
 
06:07:47.150 --> 06:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
identified here online here currently
 
06:07:49.788 --> 06:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
being paid for Education trust fund
 
06:07:51.470 --> 06:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
um that is my understanding and I think
 
06:07:53.510 --> 06:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the department can verify that for
 
06:07:55.310 --> 06:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you Mr chairman are
 
06:07:56.930 --> 06:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
there thank you are there further
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
06:08:01.128 --> 06:08:01.138 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:08:17.628 --> 06:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:19.490 --> 06:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon thank you
 
06:08:21.170 --> 06:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
for having me and thank you for all your
 
06:08:23.270 --> 06:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
time I know you all worked very hard and
 
06:08:24.590 --> 06:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
you're probably happy to be at the end
 
06:08:26.330 --> 06:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
of a long week
 
06:08:28.788 --> 06:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
um I am opposed to this bill my
 
06:08:30.110 --> 06:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
interpretation is a little different
 
06:08:32.570 --> 06:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
than what you just heard I think that
 
06:08:35.030 --> 06:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
you started I'm specifically interested
 
06:08:37.010 --> 06:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
in the education Freedom accounts aspect
 
06:08:38.930 --> 06:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
because that's listed in this bill is
 
06:08:40.490 --> 06:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
one of the things that would be
 
06:08:42.830 --> 06:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
permitted to be funded through the
 
06:08:45.830 --> 06:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and we started two
 
06:08:48.650 --> 06:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
years ago with it as a pilot project and
 
06:08:50.990 --> 06:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
under this bill you basically would have
 
06:08:53.030 --> 06:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
a blank check for the education Freedom
 
06:08:55.730 --> 06:08:55.740 align:start position:0%
accounts in the handout that is
 
06:08:58.490 --> 06:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
available to the public it says that um
 
06:09:00.650 --> 06:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
a transfer from the state general fund
 
06:09:02.690 --> 06:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
is required to bring the balance to zero
 
06:09:04.970 --> 06:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
whereas if you use up the entire
 
06:09:07.250 --> 06:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
education trust fund you would then go
 
06:09:10.368 --> 06:09:10.378 align:start position:0%
to the general fund so basically if you
 
06:09:12.350 --> 06:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
spend more in the education trust funds
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
then and the education Freedom accounts
 
06:09:17.448 --> 06:09:17.458 align:start position:0%
then is in the education trust fund you
 
06:09:18.948 --> 06:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
would would just go over to the general
 
06:09:21.230 --> 06:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
fund and continue to spend so you're
 
06:09:23.390 --> 06:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
basically putting a blank check on the
 
06:09:25.250 --> 06:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts it could be a
 
06:09:27.530 --> 06:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars and even if the
 
06:09:29.030 --> 06:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
education trust fund doesn't have that
 
06:09:31.730 --> 06:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
much money you are passing a law that
 
06:09:33.470 --> 06:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
would say it would now go over to the
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
general fund and you could spend with no
 
06:09:38.390 --> 06:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
cap whatsoever so I think that's not
 
06:09:40.368 --> 06:09:40.378 align:start position:0%
we're not ready for that we don't have
 
06:09:42.048 --> 06:09:42.058 align:start position:0%
any data in this state that this bill
 
06:09:44.510 --> 06:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
actually works so I think it would be I
 
06:09:46.490 --> 06:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
would be hesitant to support that
 
06:09:49.070 --> 06:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh in preparing I was looking at some
 
06:09:51.770 --> 06:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
research on the education vouchers Diane
 
06:09:54.048 --> 06:09:54.058 align:start position:0%
ravich who was was once the U.S
 
06:09:56.150 --> 06:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
Secretary Secretary of Education under
 
06:09:58.548 --> 06:09:58.558 align:start position:0%
George Bush the first George Bush she
 
06:10:00.410 --> 06:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
was quoting Josh McGowan a professor of
 
06:10:02.150 --> 06:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
Michigan State University who looked
 
06:10:04.670 --> 06:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
into vouchers and he said that
 
06:10:06.948 --> 06:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
large-scale studies in DC Indiana
 
06:10:09.470 --> 06:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
Louisiana Ohio show that for kids who
 
06:10:11.150 --> 06:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
left Public Schools harmful voucher
 
06:10:13.730 --> 06:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
impacts actually met or exceeded but the
 
06:10:16.250 --> 06:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
pandemic did to the test scores so we
 
06:10:18.350 --> 06:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
all know how badly the pandemic affected
 
06:10:20.750 --> 06:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
public education the long-term effect of
 
06:10:22.670 --> 06:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
vouchers was even worse and he went on
 
06:10:24.890 --> 06:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
in his statements to indicate that once
 
06:10:27.410 --> 06:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
you get past the Pilot State pilot
 
06:10:30.288 --> 06:10:30.298 align:start position:0%
program phase of the vouchers the
 
06:10:32.150 --> 06:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
effects are even worse so I would
 
06:10:34.430 --> 06:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
hesitate to see our state make this kind
 
06:10:37.610 --> 06:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
of a commitment financially I have three
 
06:10:39.948 --> 06:10:39.958 align:start position:0%
major points first is the financial
 
06:10:42.530 --> 06:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
accountability second is the educational
 
06:10:44.330 --> 06:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
accountability and third is a civil
 
06:10:46.190 --> 06:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
rights question so on the question of
 
06:10:48.830 --> 06:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
Finance accountability as I said I feel
 
06:10:50.930 --> 06:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
like this bill provides No Cap
 
06:10:53.690 --> 06:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
whatsoever these accounts could end up
 
06:10:55.730 --> 06:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
going on indefinitely with no limit
 
06:10:57.350 --> 06:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
there should be a limit as to how much
 
06:10:58.850 --> 06:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
money the state is willing to spend on
 
06:11:01.490 --> 06:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
these bills the general fund right now
 
06:11:03.650 --> 06:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
does have a surplus obviously everywhere
 
06:11:05.810 --> 06:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
around the country if you look it up
 
06:11:08.030 --> 06:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
a record number of State surpluses
 
06:11:10.610 --> 06:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
all-time high but even the Pew Center
 
06:11:12.110 --> 06:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
was just saying there's a cliff coming
 
06:11:13.850 --> 06:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
now whether or not that's this year or
 
06:11:15.948 --> 06:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
in two years the cliff is going to come
 
06:11:18.708 --> 06:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
These funds are always cyclical if you
 
06:11:21.110 --> 06:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
set up a program and then you don't have
 
06:11:23.030 --> 06:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
funding for it in two or three or four
 
06:11:24.770 --> 06:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
years the educational impact on the
 
06:11:26.090 --> 06:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
children of the state who are now
 
06:11:27.830 --> 06:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
counting on these programs and it
 
06:11:29.330 --> 06:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be funding for it would be
 
06:11:31.788 --> 06:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
disastrous it would be Reckless to
 
06:11:33.410 --> 06:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
financially invest in a program that we
 
06:11:37.070 --> 06:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
do not have a specific set funding
 
06:11:40.190 --> 06:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
dedicated funding source for second is
 
06:11:41.150 --> 06:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
the question of educational
 
06:11:43.670 --> 06:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
accountability as I indicated that one
 
06:11:45.470 --> 06:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
study indicated that vouchers have
 
06:11:47.330 --> 06:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
failed the Stanford Graduate School of
 
06:11:50.868 --> 06:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
Education Professor Martin Carney booked
 
06:11:53.208 --> 06:11:53.218 align:start position:0%
the 25 years of data and he said that
 
06:11:55.310 --> 06:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
they have failed around the country and
 
06:11:57.110 --> 06:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
he said there are better ways to invest
 
06:11:59.510 --> 06:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
our money teacher training Early
 
06:12:01.970 --> 06:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
Education after school programs things
 
06:12:04.490 --> 06:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
that we know work when we've looked at
 
06:12:06.310 --> 06:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
the voucher programs around country
 
06:12:09.170 --> 06:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
long-term studies up-to-date studies
 
06:12:11.150 --> 06:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
they are not effective so why would we
 
06:12:13.190 --> 06:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
take a huge gamble when something that
 
06:12:14.930 --> 06:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
we're not ready for we built this
 
06:12:16.910 --> 06:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
program on basically with hardly any
 
06:12:19.368 --> 06:12:19.378 align:start position:0%
foundation for it pilot project now
 
06:12:21.350 --> 06:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
we're building a five-story skyscraper
 
06:12:23.090 --> 06:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
you need to have an adequate Foundation
 
06:12:24.530 --> 06:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
if you're going to build a tall building
 
06:12:26.030 --> 06:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
that means you need to have some
 
06:12:28.128 --> 06:12:28.138 align:start position:0%
educational accountability does anybody
 
06:12:29.930 --> 06:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
have any test results from any of the
 
06:12:31.250 --> 06:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
children who have been in the voucher
 
06:12:33.530 --> 06:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
program so far comparing their niwa
 
06:12:35.930 --> 06:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
results before and afterwards we don't
 
06:12:37.788 --> 06:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire is going to have the
 
06:12:39.110 --> 06:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
same results that we've had around the
 
06:12:40.788 --> 06:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
country why would we want to give a
 
06:12:42.288 --> 06:12:42.298 align:start position:0%
blank check to something until we know
 
06:12:44.750 --> 06:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
that it actually works now I've heard in
 
06:12:46.670 --> 06:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
the paper that we don't need to have
 
06:12:48.530 --> 06:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
education or financial accountability
 
06:12:50.868 --> 06:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
because who knows better where their
 
06:12:52.910 --> 06:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
children should be at than the parents
 
06:12:54.530 --> 06:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's all the accountability that we
 
06:12:57.530 --> 06:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
need but if that's true then why don't
 
06:12:59.448 --> 06:12:59.458 align:start position:0%
we have educational Freedom accounts for
 
06:13:01.368 --> 06:13:01.378 align:start position:0%
all the children in the property poor
 
06:13:04.010 --> 06:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
towns there are tens of thousands of
 
06:13:05.448 --> 06:13:05.458 align:start position:0%
these children out there if we trust
 
06:13:07.610 --> 06:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
parent with money let's give every one
 
06:13:09.288 --> 06:13:09.298 align:start position:0%
of them five thousand dollars they can
 
06:13:10.610 --> 06:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
build Wi-Fi in their home better
 
06:13:12.288 --> 06:13:12.298 align:start position:0%
computers take their family on trips
 
06:13:14.690 --> 06:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
hire tutors whatever they want to do if
 
06:13:16.490 --> 06:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
you're not willing to actually spend
 
06:13:17.750 --> 06:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
money and give it to the school
 
06:13:19.670 --> 06:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
districts in Claremont and all these
 
06:13:21.590 --> 06:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
other towns that can't raise enough
 
06:13:23.868 --> 06:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
money locally to fund their schools but
 
06:13:25.430 --> 06:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
why not give five thousand dollars to
 
06:13:27.470 --> 06:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
every parent for every child in those
 
06:13:29.090 --> 06:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
schools first and if there's any money
 
06:13:31.190 --> 06:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
left over then give it to the parents
 
06:13:32.570 --> 06:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
who can afford to pay their property
 
06:13:34.548 --> 06:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
taxes and send their children to a
 
06:13:36.350 --> 06:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
private school put them at the end of
 
06:13:38.090 --> 06:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
the line don't put those people at the
 
06:13:40.070 --> 06:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
front of the line put them at the end of
 
06:13:41.930 --> 06:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
the line give this money to the places
 
06:13:44.030 --> 06:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
who need it first if you really trust
 
06:13:45.470 --> 06:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
parents and that's all the
 
06:13:47.628 --> 06:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
accountability that you want you say we
 
06:13:49.850 --> 06:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
don't need accountability they give it
 
06:13:51.048 --> 06:13:51.058 align:start position:0%
to the people who really need it because
 
06:13:52.910 --> 06:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
they have a demonstrated educational
 
06:13:55.368 --> 06:13:55.378 align:start position:0%
need the third area is civil rights
 
06:13:57.470 --> 06:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
accountability I was looking up some
 
06:13:59.208 --> 06:13:59.218 align:start position:0%
legislative history comments just to
 
06:14:00.708 --> 06:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
find out exactly what it meant and it
 
06:14:02.330 --> 06:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
was a Oh here it is New Hampshire
 
06:14:04.368 --> 06:14:04.378 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case Justice Duggan wrote
 
06:14:06.770 --> 06:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
this decision and he said if a statute
 
06:14:08.390 --> 06:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
is ambiguous we consider a legislative
 
06:14:10.970 --> 06:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
history our goal is to apply statutes in
 
06:14:12.830 --> 06:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
light of the legislators intent in
 
06:14:14.750 --> 06:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
enacting them in light of the policies
 
06:14:16.310 --> 06:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
sought to be Advanced by the entire
 
06:14:18.830 --> 06:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme this bill is about
 
06:14:20.690 --> 06:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
finances I understand but there's been a
 
06:14:22.190 --> 06:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
raft of bills that would expand
 
06:14:24.170 --> 06:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the for the education
 
06:14:25.670 --> 06:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts
 
06:14:29.448 --> 06:14:29.458 align:start position:0%
the question is are these Public Schools
 
06:14:32.628 --> 06:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
or not now when I was here last week
 
06:14:32.638 --> 06:14:33.288 align:start position:0%
or not now when I was here last week
um

06:14:33.288 --> 06:14:33.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:36.288 --> 06:14:36.298 align:start position:0%
Mrs Kate Baker Demers who is the
 
06:14:38.510 --> 06:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
administrator of the scholarship fund
 
06:14:39.948 --> 06:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
who's really thought that the only
 
06:14:41.208 --> 06:14:41.218 align:start position:0%
person in the state who runs this
 
06:14:42.288 --> 06:14:42.298 align:start position:0%
program because the Department of
 
06:14:44.208 --> 06:14:44.218 align:start position:0%
Education doesn't run it I know there's
 
06:14:45.650 --> 06:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
a bill to make the Department of
 
06:14:47.750 --> 06:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
Education run it she testified that she
 
06:14:50.510 --> 06:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
sees these programs as quote part of
 
06:14:53.090 --> 06:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
public education system and its public
 
06:14:55.910 --> 06:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
education and infrastructure so the
 
06:14:58.190 --> 06:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
people who are running the program see
 
06:15:00.230 --> 06:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
the vouchers and the money that they're
 
06:15:01.730 --> 06:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
going to and sixty percent of the money
 
06:15:03.830 --> 06:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's been spent has been is direct
 
06:15:06.410 --> 06:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
tuition to private schools she sees them
 
06:15:08.930 --> 06:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
as part of the public education system
 
06:15:11.208 --> 06:15:11.218 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to me that's
 
06:15:13.670 --> 06:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
legislative history so these education
 
06:15:16.430 --> 06:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts are now public actors
 
06:15:18.530 --> 06:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
if they're Public Schools they should
 
06:15:20.890 --> 06:15:20.900 align:start position:0%
have to follow RSA
 
06:15:23.270 --> 06:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
193.38 that no person shall be subject
 
06:15:24.890 --> 06:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
to discrimination in the public schools
 
06:15:26.448 --> 06:15:26.458 align:start position:0%
now the basis of race sex gender
 
06:15:28.548 --> 06:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
identity sexual orientation disability
 
06:15:31.430 --> 06:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
if we are going to give money to people
 
06:15:33.890 --> 06:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
to pay tuition to go to a private school
 
06:15:35.628 --> 06:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
for any private school that wants to
 
06:15:37.490 --> 06:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
receive that money should in turn tell
 
06:15:39.890 --> 06:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
the state we will follow State rules and
 
06:15:41.390 --> 06:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
regulations like all other public
 
06:15:43.310 --> 06:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
schools because now we are public
 
06:15:45.048 --> 06:15:45.058 align:start position:0%
schools as part of the legislative
 
06:15:47.030 --> 06:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
history and that would also mean that
 
06:15:48.830 --> 06:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
you can't tell people when you go to
 
06:15:50.390 --> 06:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
these schools you have to sign away your
 
06:15:52.788 --> 06:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
right to a quote free and appropriate
 
06:15:55.548 --> 06:15:55.558 align:start position:0%
education under Federal special ed laws
 
06:15:57.850 --> 06:15:57.860 align:start position:0%
what happens is that children need
 
06:16:00.530 --> 06:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
education special ed services every
 
06:16:02.810 --> 06:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
single day but if they go to a private
 
06:16:04.128 --> 06:16:04.138 align:start position:0%
school they don't get it now maybe they
 
06:16:05.510 --> 06:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
can take the five thousand and buy some
 
06:16:07.368 --> 06:16:07.378 align:start position:0%
extra tutoring after school but they're
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
forfeiting the rights to special ed
 
06:16:11.448 --> 06:16:11.458 align:start position:0%
every single day all day long in those
 
06:16:13.368 --> 06:16:13.378 align:start position:0%
schools if these schools want to be
 
06:16:15.170 --> 06:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
considered part of the public education
 
06:16:17.150 --> 06:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
system they should just simply agree to
 
06:16:18.830 --> 06:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
follow all applicable state and federal
 
06:16:20.930 --> 06:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
laws in the state no discrimination on
 
06:16:22.970 --> 06:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
the basis of disability also I would
 
06:16:25.128 --> 06:16:25.138 align:start position:0%
mention lgbtq rights because there's a
 
06:16:27.170 --> 06:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
lot of religious schools that prohibit
 
06:16:30.288 --> 06:16:30.298 align:start position:0%
people who are lgbtq from teaching in
 
06:16:33.250 --> 06:16:33.260 align:start position:0%
these schools if you're a married couple
 
06:16:35.750 --> 06:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of your child's status you
 
06:16:37.430 --> 06:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
can't bring your child to those schools
 
06:16:39.170 --> 06:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
and if you're a child who identifies as
 
06:16:41.570 --> 06:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
lgbtq you cannot attend these schools
 
06:16:43.750 --> 06:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
that would be in contravention to RSA
 
06:16:46.490 --> 06:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
19338 no discrimination on the basis of
 
06:16:48.890 --> 06:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
gender identity or sexual orientation so
 
06:16:51.048 --> 06:16:51.058 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire really wanting to give
 
06:16:53.330 --> 06:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars to parents to send
 
06:16:55.128 --> 06:16:55.138 align:start position:0%
their children to schools that
 
06:16:57.830 --> 06:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
discriminate against members of the LGBT
 
06:16:59.150 --> 06:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
community now obviously they have the
 
06:17:00.890 --> 06:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
right to do that under religious freedom
 
06:17:02.628 --> 06:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
but the question is do we as a state
 
06:17:04.510 --> 06:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
want to spend our money
 
06:17:07.128 --> 06:17:07.138 align:start position:0%
supporting that or should they have to
 
06:17:09.230 --> 06:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
follow at a minimum State rules the last
 
06:17:10.670 --> 06:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
group that falls into this is the home
 
06:17:11.990 --> 06:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
school category and I realize they're
 
06:17:13.368 --> 06:17:13.378 align:start position:0%
not really technically homeschool now
 
06:17:15.170 --> 06:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
they're EFA students but at any event
 
06:17:17.030 --> 06:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
the question is when does a school
 
06:17:19.070 --> 06:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
become a school there was testimony last
 
06:17:21.530 --> 06:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
week from somebody who has a a learning
 
06:17:23.868 --> 06:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
center and dairy and they had like a
 
06:17:26.270 --> 06:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
hundred students on their roster and she
 
06:17:28.190 --> 06:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
said any given day they have 40 to 60
 
06:17:31.070 --> 06:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
people at their school right to me that
 
06:17:32.990 --> 06:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like a school so I looked up at
 
06:17:35.150 --> 06:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education website how
 
06:17:36.830 --> 06:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
many small schools are there in the
 
06:17:39.350 --> 06:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
state and there's 50 between the talent
 
06:17:41.208 --> 06:17:41.218 align:start position:0%
schools and the charter schools 50
 
06:17:43.128 --> 06:17:43.138 align:start position:0%
schools that have 60 or less students so
 
06:17:45.350 --> 06:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
being small does not mean that you
 
06:17:47.390 --> 06:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
aren't a school you are still a school
 
06:17:49.490 --> 06:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
so I think now look if two families are
 
06:17:51.170 --> 06:17:51.180 align:start position:0%
doing homeschooling together this week
 
06:17:53.090 --> 06:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
you take my kids to the museum next week
 
06:17:54.830 --> 06:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
they come over to my place and we do a
 
06:17:56.990 --> 06:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
project that's not a school but when you
 
06:17:58.910 --> 06:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
start getting up to 12 people and you
 
06:18:00.110 --> 06:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
have a building that you're going to
 
06:18:02.090 --> 06:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
every single day to me that's a school
 
06:18:03.650 --> 06:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
so I think if you want to be getting
 
06:18:05.810 --> 06:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
money from the state shape and acting
 
06:18:07.670 --> 06:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
like a school that you should have to
 
06:18:09.890 --> 06:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
follow the rules of being a school so if
 
06:18:11.868 --> 06:18:11.878 align:start position:0%
you want to pass this bill and all these
 
06:18:13.490 --> 06:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account bills I think
 
06:18:15.350 --> 06:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
the prudent thing to do is to lay down
 
06:18:17.270 --> 06:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
the structures in place put Financial
 
06:18:19.610 --> 06:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
accountability in place put educational
 
06:18:21.410 --> 06:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
accountability in place and put civil
 
06:18:23.330 --> 06:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
rights accountability in place don't go
 
06:18:25.250 --> 06:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
passing the tail end of the bill before
 
06:18:26.868 --> 06:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
you've built the foundation on the house
 
06:18:29.270 --> 06:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
so that's all I have thank you thank you
 
06:18:30.288 --> 06:18:30.298 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions
 
06:18:32.628 --> 06:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative McConnell thank you Mr
 
06:18:34.250 --> 06:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony
 
06:18:36.230 --> 06:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
06:18:37.910 --> 06:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
um from what I understand when I read
 
06:18:40.070 --> 06:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and as it's introduced it's
 
06:18:42.708 --> 06:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
more of a housekeeping bill so your
 
06:18:44.750 --> 06:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
testimony differs so I'm just curious
 
06:18:46.610 --> 06:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
for clarification from your
 
06:18:49.190 --> 06:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
understanding you said this as you put a
 
06:18:53.570 --> 06:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
blank check what this weighs the cap or
 
06:18:56.628 --> 06:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
remove the cap that exists on freedom
 
06:18:58.610 --> 06:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
accounts does this make that change this
 
06:19:00.350 --> 06:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
bill If This Were to pass as reading
 
06:19:02.090 --> 06:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
okay I don't think it changes the amount
 
06:19:03.708 --> 06:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
of money that people would receive for
 
06:19:05.868 --> 06:19:05.878 align:start position:0%
the for the accounts my understanding is
 
06:19:09.110 --> 06:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
that the original passage of this bill
 
06:19:11.270 --> 06:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
the last time was not done as an
 
06:19:13.070 --> 06:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
independent act it was thrown part of
 
06:19:16.190 --> 06:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
the massive budget so it didn't get
 
06:19:19.010 --> 06:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
individual clarification and the lawsuit
 
06:19:21.288 --> 06:19:21.298 align:start position:0%
that was referenced by a question I
 
06:19:22.910 --> 06:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
think from representative Tanner is
 
06:19:24.350 --> 06:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
about whether or not the education
 
06:19:27.470 --> 06:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts can use money from the
 
06:19:29.270 --> 06:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
education trust fund which was set up
 
06:19:31.850 --> 06:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
specifically to address adequacy and the
 
06:19:34.128 --> 06:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
differences in in between the poor and
 
06:19:36.350 --> 06:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
property poor and property Rich towns so
 
06:19:38.570 --> 06:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
I don't think there is a legislative
 
06:19:41.090 --> 06:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
directive that exists that says
 
06:19:43.250 --> 06:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts should be
 
06:19:45.288 --> 06:19:45.298 align:start position:0%
getting their money from the education
 
06:19:48.590 --> 06:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
trust and I maybe I I you are more aware
 
06:19:50.090 --> 06:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
of these things than I am but for my
 
06:19:51.890 --> 06:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
reading is that coming into this session
 
06:19:54.288 --> 06:19:54.298 align:start position:0%
that had yet to be established and that
 
06:19:56.510 --> 06:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's a perhaps a goal now to make
 
06:19:58.610 --> 06:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
that be something that's established and
 
06:20:00.410 --> 06:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'm saying if you do that and then with
 
06:20:01.970 --> 06:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
a little paragraph at the end that says
 
06:20:03.288 --> 06:20:03.298 align:start position:0%
if you run out of money we'll just take
 
06:20:04.850 --> 06:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
it out of the general fund that's where
 
06:20:06.948 --> 06:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
the blank check comes in so again I
 
06:20:08.570 --> 06:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
could be wrong and maybe this is not
 
06:20:10.070 --> 06:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
directly applicable but I think that
 
06:20:11.990 --> 06:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's a general comment on the education
 
06:20:14.090 --> 06:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts that we need to make
 
06:20:16.010 --> 06:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
sure that these have these types of
 
06:20:19.610 --> 06:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
accountability follow-up please yes so
 
06:20:21.590 --> 06:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
to clarify just to make it abundantly
 
06:20:23.690 --> 06:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
clear maybe the department could clarify
 
06:20:25.730 --> 06:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
as well but as you interpret this bill
 
06:20:28.190 --> 06:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
this changes the statute it doesn't just
 
06:20:31.910 --> 06:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
clean it up yes okay thank you
 
06:20:34.548 --> 06:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
further discussion or questions from the
 
06:20:34.558 --> 06:20:36.230 align:start position:0%
further discussion or questions from the
committee

06:20:36.230 --> 06:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:20:38.090 --> 06:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
nothing thank you very much thank you
 
06:20:44.810 --> 06:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:54.070 --> 06:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:56.570 --> 06:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Ladd and members
 
06:20:57.948 --> 06:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
of the education committee I'm happy to
 
06:21:00.170 --> 06:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
be here again uh testifying in front of
 
06:21:01.850 --> 06:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
you and I do have written testimony I'll
 
06:21:05.030 --> 06:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
give you after try and summarize it
 
06:21:05.040 --> 06:21:06.590 align:start position:0%
give you after try and summarize it
um

06:21:06.590 --> 06:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:08.690 --> 06:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
to my reading this is more than a
 
06:21:10.730 --> 06:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill it does change the
 
06:21:13.670 --> 06:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
intent of the education trust fund
 
06:21:15.590 --> 06:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to stick a little more with
 
06:21:17.270 --> 06:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
a history lesson even though I'm a
 
06:21:18.650 --> 06:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
reading teacher
 
06:21:18.660 --> 06:21:21.948 align:start position:0%
reading teacher
um

06:21:21.948 --> 06:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:24.048 --> 06:21:24.058 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a constitutional
 
06:21:26.288 --> 06:21:26.298 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide
 
06:21:29.208 --> 06:21:29.218 align:start position:0%
a public education
 
06:21:32.090 --> 06:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
that has been found it's written in our
 
06:21:33.410 --> 06:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
constitution it's also been found
 
06:21:36.170 --> 06:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
through several court cases that we have
 
06:21:39.170 --> 06:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
an obligation to provide our children
 
06:21:41.868 --> 06:21:41.878 align:start position:0%
with a public education families can
 
06:21:44.090 --> 06:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
choose other options
 
06:21:46.610 --> 06:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire as a state has to
 
06:21:48.708 --> 06:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
provide public schools and a public
 
06:21:51.110 --> 06:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
education and fund it
 
06:21:51.120 --> 06:21:52.430 align:start position:0%
education and fund it
um

06:21:52.430 --> 06:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:54.830 --> 06:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
State funding has not always been
 
06:21:57.350 --> 06:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
sufficient or fairly distributed again
 
06:21:59.448 --> 06:21:59.458 align:start position:0%
that's not just my opinion the court has
 
06:22:01.548 --> 06:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
found that several times the education
 
06:22:05.150 --> 06:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund was set up an attempt to
 
06:22:07.128 --> 06:22:07.138 align:start position:0%
address this after previous Court
 
06:22:07.138 --> 06:22:08.270 align:start position:0%
address this after previous Court
rulings

06:22:08.270 --> 06:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
rulings
 
06:22:11.208 --> 06:22:11.218 align:start position:0%
and it was limited to public school
 
06:22:12.830 --> 06:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
students public schools and public
 
06:22:14.448 --> 06:22:14.458 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
06:22:17.090 --> 06:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
so although money may be coming out of
 
06:22:19.368 --> 06:22:19.378 align:start position:0%
it that doesn't mean money should be
 
06:22:20.810 --> 06:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
coming out of it for some of these other
 
06:22:20.820 --> 06:22:21.890 align:start position:0%
coming out of it for some of these other
programs

06:22:21.890 --> 06:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
programs
 
06:22:23.930 --> 06:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh and there is currently a lawsuit on
 
06:22:23.940 --> 06:22:25.368 align:start position:0%
uh and there is currently a lawsuit on
that

06:22:25.368 --> 06:22:25.378 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:22:27.948 --> 06:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
when you start adding in programs that
 
06:22:30.830 --> 06:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
are not going to public school students
 
06:22:32.030 --> 06:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
public schools and public school
 
06:22:32.040 --> 06:22:33.110 align:start position:0%
public schools and public school
districts

06:22:33.110 --> 06:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
districts
 
06:22:35.868 --> 06:22:35.878 align:start position:0%
you run into the potential for
 
06:22:38.628 --> 06:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
difficulty because tax money is not
 
06:22:41.150 --> 06:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
Limitless we all know that we all pay
 
06:22:43.610 --> 06:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
06:22:45.650 --> 06:22:45.660 align:start position:0%
um and it's all coming out of the
 
06:22:47.390 --> 06:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayer's pocket
 
06:22:50.628 --> 06:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
so when you start running short on money
 
06:22:53.410 --> 06:22:53.420 align:start position:0%
you are either going to be
 
06:22:57.350 --> 06:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
shortchanging your 160 000 students in
 
06:22:58.670 --> 06:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
06:23:01.850 --> 06:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
or and I believe the voucher law was
 
06:23:04.368 --> 06:23:04.378 align:start position:0%
written so that you can't shortchange
 
06:23:07.128 --> 06:23:07.138 align:start position:0%
that uh the speaker before me I think
 
06:23:08.690 --> 06:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
had that correct I don't have that in my
 
06:23:08.700 --> 06:23:09.830 align:start position:0%
had that correct I don't have that in my
notes

06:23:09.830 --> 06:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
notes
 
06:23:09.840 --> 06:23:11.390 align:start position:0%
notes
um

06:23:11.390 --> 06:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:13.010 --> 06:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
or you're going to go back to the
 
06:23:15.590 --> 06:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers either at the state level or
 
06:23:17.628 --> 06:23:17.638 align:start position:0%
through your local property taxes to
 
06:23:19.610 --> 06:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
have them make up the difference when
 
06:23:20.810 --> 06:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
you don't have enough to fund your
 
06:23:20.820 --> 06:23:22.310 align:start position:0%
you don't have enough to fund your
schools

06:23:22.310 --> 06:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:23:25.910 --> 06:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
so I am speaking in opposition to HB 440
 
06:23:28.310 --> 06:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
it is much more than a husky being built
 
06:23:31.670 --> 06:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
it is adding in a program that is not
 
06:23:31.680 --> 06:23:33.230 align:start position:0%
it is adding in a program that is not
currently

06:23:33.230 --> 06:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:23:35.390 --> 06:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
written into the education trust fund
 
06:23:38.270 --> 06:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
and to my opinion and the opinion of my
 
06:23:41.030 --> 06:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
4 000 members across the state uh it
 
06:23:42.470 --> 06:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
does not belong there
 
06:23:44.930 --> 06:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
we want to keep our commitment to public
 
06:23:46.788 --> 06:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
education strong the state has a
 
06:23:48.890 --> 06:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation and we want to
 
06:23:51.110 --> 06:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
see you meet that so that all of our
 
06:23:53.570 --> 06:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
students have a chance to thrive and
 
06:23:55.368 --> 06:23:55.378 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony thank you very much
 
06:23:57.048 --> 06:23:57.058 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
06:23:57.058 --> 06:23:59.208 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

06:23:59.208 --> 06:23:59.218 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:24:02.090 --> 06:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing you thank you very much
 
06:24:10.850 --> 06:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:10.860 --> 06:24:15.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:24:15.010 --> 06:24:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:17.030 --> 06:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee bear Christina
 
06:24:18.470 --> 06:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire School Board Association
 
06:24:20.570 --> 06:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this bill
 
06:24:22.490 --> 06:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
um I can't follow the first speaker
 
06:24:25.310 --> 06:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
um we we Echo and support and reiterate
 
06:24:27.048 --> 06:24:27.058 align:start position:0%
um everything that that first Speaker
 
06:24:29.810 --> 06:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
said and certainly reiterate uh the
 
06:24:32.330 --> 06:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
testimony from Ms house as well too
 
06:24:33.708 --> 06:24:33.718 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the language in front of
 
06:24:35.628 --> 06:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
me but nhsba has a couple long-standing
 
06:24:38.030 --> 06:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
resolutions that we support public money
 
06:24:40.610 --> 06:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
for public schools and we also support
 
06:24:41.690 --> 06:24:41.700 align:start position:0%

06:24:43.548 --> 06:24:43.558 align:start position:0%
Obligations to support Public Schools
 
06:24:46.430 --> 06:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
before it funds any other program I'm
 
06:24:47.990 --> 06:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
going to save you a lot of time and
 
06:24:49.610 --> 06:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
effort I'm not going to get into the um
 
06:24:52.430 --> 06:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know the the merits of of the
 
06:24:54.230 --> 06:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
voucher bill as this bill is not
 
06:24:57.110 --> 06:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
relative to that but we oppose the bill
 
06:24:58.548 --> 06:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
we support public money for public
 
06:25:00.650 --> 06:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
schools we support the state fully
 
06:25:02.510 --> 06:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
funding its um outstanding obligations
 
06:25:04.490 --> 06:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
that it's been neglectful of the public
 
06:25:06.350 --> 06:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
schools for at least the last 15 years
 
06:25:07.850 --> 06:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
of not going back longer if you want to
 
06:25:08.990 --> 06:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
bring adequacy into this whole
 
06:25:10.970 --> 06:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
conversation as well too and with that
 
06:25:12.590 --> 06:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions thank
 
06:25:14.330 --> 06:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions for the
 
06:25:17.030 --> 06:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
school boards Association
 
06:25:22.910 --> 06:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:25.070 --> 06:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
is there anybody here on the committee
 
06:25:26.570 --> 06:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's going to request information from
 
06:25:29.590 --> 06:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
06:25:44.090 --> 06:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:46.670 --> 06:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank you Mr chair
 
06:25:48.470 --> 06:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Caitlin for providing
 
06:25:50.150 --> 06:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
information all day today
 
06:25:52.788 --> 06:25:52.798 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify a question I asked
 
06:25:54.830 --> 06:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
earlier to another speaker does this
 
06:25:57.350 --> 06:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
feel as reading change statue or is it
 
06:25:59.810 --> 06:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
just a clean up statute
 
06:26:03.110 --> 06:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
there are there is one change
 
06:26:06.708 --> 06:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
um to clarify that this bill does
 
06:26:08.090 --> 06:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
let's see did I just want to double
 
06:26:08.100 --> 06:26:19.030 align:start position:0%
let's see did I just want to double
check

06:26:19.030 --> 06:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:22.730 --> 06:26:22.740 align:start position:0%
so there is one proposal that is
 
06:26:23.868 --> 06:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
included in the department of
 
06:26:25.628 --> 06:26:25.638 align:start position:0%
education's budget
 
06:26:28.970 --> 06:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
to include lease aid for chartered
 
06:26:30.590 --> 06:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
public schools in the education trust
 
06:26:32.150 --> 06:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
fund and move it from the general fund
 
06:26:34.788 --> 06:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
that is a departure from current law and
 
06:26:38.570 --> 06:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:39.770 --> 06:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Education had
 
06:26:41.330 --> 06:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
previously included that in our budget
 
06:26:42.410 --> 06:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
and has been in our budget in the
 
06:26:44.628 --> 06:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
general fund for the last I don't know
 
06:26:47.448 --> 06:26:47.458 align:start position:0%
six ish years it's about 500 000 a year
 
06:26:47.458 --> 06:26:48.770 align:start position:0%
six ish years it's about 500 000 a year
appropriation

06:26:48.770 --> 06:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
06:26:50.030 --> 06:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and we suggested moving into the
 
06:26:51.770 --> 06:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so the statute does
 
06:26:52.910 --> 06:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
do that
 
06:26:55.910 --> 06:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
um the majority of the language here
 
06:26:58.070 --> 06:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
um is correcting
 
06:27:00.830 --> 06:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
um or codifying existing practices at
 
06:27:02.750 --> 06:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
the department can I ask a follower
 
06:27:05.510 --> 06:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
please yes you may okay so thank you for
 
06:27:07.910 --> 06:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
that and the change that you said was
 
06:27:10.548 --> 06:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
relative to lease aid for Charter
 
06:27:12.830 --> 06:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
Schools yes so there's no changes
 
06:27:14.628 --> 06:27:14.638 align:start position:0%
relative to the freedom accounts in this
 
06:27:17.090 --> 06:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
is that correct um I cannot specifically
 
06:27:18.770 --> 06:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
talk about the freedom accounts as we
 
06:27:20.270 --> 06:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
have pending litigation
 
06:27:23.390 --> 06:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
06:27:25.010 --> 06:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell
 
06:27:27.470 --> 06:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you Caitlin and this
 
06:27:28.850 --> 06:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
may have been explained and I may have
 
06:27:30.410 --> 06:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
missed it but on the fiscal note one
 
06:27:31.970 --> 06:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
percent to the Department of Education
 
06:27:34.368 --> 06:27:34.378 align:start position:0%
for 10 million dollars to I guess
 
06:27:35.990 --> 06:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
administer all of these is that
 
06:27:37.490 --> 06:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
something new or is that all something
 
06:27:39.170 --> 06:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
we've always done that is a request on
 
06:27:40.310 --> 06:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Department of Education
 
06:27:44.030 --> 06:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you further questions
 
06:27:44.040 --> 06:27:45.948 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you further questions
woodcock

06:27:45.948 --> 06:27:45.958 align:start position:0%

um
 
06:27:50.510 --> 06:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm sure you'd love to be
 
06:27:51.430 --> 06:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
here on Friday
 
06:27:54.948 --> 06:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh
 
06:27:57.170 --> 06:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
when representative cordelli presented
 
06:27:58.310 --> 06:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:28:00.350 --> 06:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
um I asked them as did represent Lucas
 
06:28:03.110 --> 06:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
if there's anything in here that was new
 
06:28:04.730 --> 06:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
and hadn't been previously funded and he
 
06:28:07.788 --> 06:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
said no everything's as it had been
 
06:28:10.788 --> 06:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
um and you indicated that that's not
 
06:28:12.470 --> 06:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
correct that the child school is not in
 
06:28:14.448 --> 06:28:14.458 align:start position:0%
there previously
 
06:28:14.458 --> 06:28:15.470 align:start position:0%
there previously
um

06:28:15.470 --> 06:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:17.868 --> 06:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
the question that represent McDonald
 
06:28:23.090 --> 06:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
asked about the efas uh your response is
 
06:28:25.970 --> 06:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
that is pending litigation so that you
 
06:28:27.948 --> 06:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
can't comment on that which is which is
 
06:28:30.310 --> 06:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
fine but in the presentation
 
06:28:32.510 --> 06:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli indicated that
 
06:28:35.570 --> 06:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
this bill he was doing it at the request
 
06:28:37.690 --> 06:28:37.700 align:start position:0%
of doe
 
06:28:37.700 --> 06:28:39.288 align:start position:0%
of doe
so

06:28:39.288 --> 06:28:39.298 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:28:43.310 --> 06:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
um so doe is knowingly putting this bill
 
06:28:46.610 --> 06:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
forward with litigation pending is that
 
06:28:46.620 --> 06:28:47.810 align:start position:0%
forward with litigation pending is that
correct

06:28:47.810 --> 06:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:28:47.820 --> 06:28:48.350 align:start position:0%
correct
um

06:28:48.350 --> 06:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:49.850 --> 06:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
Department of Education did put this
 
06:28:52.548 --> 06:28:52.558 align:start position:0%
bill forward to request a codification
 
06:28:56.208 --> 06:28:56.218 align:start position:0%
of current practices and an updating of
 
06:28:59.570 --> 06:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
current law yes I do want to correct a
 
06:29:02.208 --> 06:29:02.218 align:start position:0%
point that you had just said as far as
 
06:29:04.850 --> 06:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
putting charter schools in charter
 
06:29:06.770 --> 06:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
schools have historically been paid out
 
06:29:08.930 --> 06:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund as far as
 
06:29:11.628 --> 06:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
charter school adequacy the only change
 
06:29:14.030 --> 06:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
was the charter school lease Aid which
 
06:29:15.708 --> 06:29:15.718 align:start position:0%
has not historically been paid out of
 
06:29:16.970 --> 06:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and the
 
06:29:18.830 --> 06:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
department made that request as part of
 
06:29:20.750 --> 06:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
our agency request for the state budget
 
06:29:23.330 --> 06:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you chairman thank
 
06:29:25.250 --> 06:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
you uh Caitlin I have a question for you
 
06:29:27.110 --> 06:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the in the law book I'm looking at
 
06:29:30.010 --> 06:29:30.020 align:start position:0%
194 F colon 11.
 
06:29:33.048 --> 06:29:33.058 align:start position:0%
that's uh in the section referencing the
 
06:29:34.970 --> 06:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
efas and its appropriation from the
 
06:29:37.548 --> 06:29:37.558 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so it speaks to
 
06:29:37.558 --> 06:29:38.390 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so it speaks to
this

06:29:38.390 --> 06:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:29:40.310 --> 06:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
it reads the amount necessary to fund
 
06:29:42.110 --> 06:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
any grants or transfers of funds
 
06:29:44.510 --> 06:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
authorized under this chapter is hereby
 
06:29:46.310 --> 06:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the department from the
 
06:29:48.530 --> 06:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
education trust fund created under RSA
 
06:29:51.350 --> 06:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
198 colon 39. could you please explain
 
06:29:51.360 --> 06:29:53.270 align:start position:0%
198 colon 39. could you please explain
that

06:29:53.270 --> 06:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:55.548 --> 06:29:55.558 align:start position:0%
again I cannot discuss the EFA portion
 
06:29:56.990 --> 06:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill relative to the pending
 
06:29:57.000 --> 06:29:58.430 align:start position:0%
of this bill relative to the pending
litigation

06:29:58.430 --> 06:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
06:30:00.530 --> 06:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:30:03.470 --> 06:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
represent Luna thank you very much Mr
 
06:30:05.510 --> 06:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
chair thanks again Caitlyn for for for
 
06:30:07.128 --> 06:30:07.138 align:start position:0%
being here
 
06:30:10.430 --> 06:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
um could um could you uh talk with us a
 
06:30:13.610 --> 06:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
little bit about how the um how the
 
06:30:13.620 --> 06:30:14.390 align:start position:0%
little bit about how the um how the
state

06:30:14.390 --> 06:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:30:17.510 --> 06:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
um budgets and um and appropriates I
 
06:30:19.490 --> 06:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
guess for lease space to approve Charter
 
06:30:19.500 --> 06:30:20.628 align:start position:0%
guess for lease space to approve Charter
Schools

06:30:20.628 --> 06:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
Schools
 
06:30:23.390 --> 06:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
um which is now some new language that's
 
06:30:24.830 --> 06:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
been yes
 
06:30:27.230 --> 06:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
um so that process is there is a lease
 
06:30:29.810 --> 06:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
Aid section of the law I think it's our
 
06:30:31.010 --> 06:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
small it's reference right here or
 
06:30:32.570 --> 06:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
whatever that is
 
06:30:34.788 --> 06:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
um and so the process is is that the
 
06:30:36.288 --> 06:30:36.298 align:start position:0%
Department of Education accepts
 
06:30:38.448 --> 06:30:38.458 align:start position:0%
applications from Charter Schools
 
06:30:41.150 --> 06:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
relative to lease-based I believe it's
 
06:30:43.670 --> 06:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
on January 1st of every year
 
06:30:46.010 --> 06:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
um and then there are certain categories
 
06:30:49.070 --> 06:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
or types of things in the charter
 
06:30:50.628 --> 06:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
schools lease for a space that we will
 
06:30:54.530 --> 06:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
pay for and then we determine a
 
06:30:55.788 --> 06:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
calculation and the department of
 
06:30:57.288 --> 06:30:57.298 align:start position:0%
educational pay
 
06:31:00.470 --> 06:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
the the lesser of
 
06:31:00.480 --> 06:31:02.030 align:start position:0%
the the lesser of
30

06:31:02.030 --> 06:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
30
 
06:31:05.208 --> 06:31:05.218 align:start position:0%
30 or 50 000 a year I it did just change
 
06:31:08.330 --> 06:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
I believe worth 30 of the lease in total
 
06:31:10.368 --> 06:31:10.378 align:start position:0%
to a charter school
 
06:31:13.448 --> 06:31:13.458 align:start position:0%
um that has been appropriated
 
06:31:15.708 --> 06:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
this is the third or fourth biennium
 
06:31:16.610 --> 06:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
that this has been currently
 
06:31:17.930 --> 06:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the department and
 
06:31:19.270 --> 06:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
06:31:22.430 --> 06:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
yes you may and so so and when you say
 
06:31:24.770 --> 06:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
that that it's third or fourth year that
 
06:31:26.690 --> 06:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
it's been appropriated through General
 
06:31:28.310 --> 06:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
funds is that do you mean through the
 
06:31:30.770 --> 06:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
budget process with a specific dollar
 
06:31:33.770 --> 06:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
value yes yes and it is prorated right
 
06:31:36.530 --> 06:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
now okay and then would would that
 
06:31:38.690 --> 06:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
continue to happen
 
06:31:41.570 --> 06:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
or would that would this now defer to
 
06:31:44.930 --> 06:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and as long as
 
06:31:48.470 --> 06:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
the lease application follows the rules
 
06:31:51.890 --> 06:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
prescribed in 19815 HH then
 
06:31:54.288 --> 06:31:54.298 align:start position:0%
Appropriations would be automatic and
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
come from the education trust fund
 
06:31:58.670 --> 06:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
correct we would change node well it
 
06:32:00.110 --> 06:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
would still need to be appropriated in
 
06:32:02.868 --> 06:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund but um but no
 
06:32:05.390 --> 06:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
amount would need to be as long as it
 
06:32:05.400 --> 06:32:07.850 align:start position:0%
amount would need to be as long as it
qualified

06:32:07.850 --> 06:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
06:32:09.410 --> 06:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
um an amount would still need to be
 
06:32:11.868 --> 06:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
appropriated um in the budget in the
 
06:32:13.010 --> 06:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
budget yes
 
06:32:14.810 --> 06:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:32:17.810 --> 06:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative Tanner
 
06:32:19.490 --> 06:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
06:32:21.530 --> 06:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
question I was just kind of comparing
 
06:32:24.288 --> 06:32:24.298 align:start position:0%
198 colon 39
 
06:32:27.288 --> 06:32:27.298 align:start position:0%
with the bill to see which cross
 
06:32:29.090 --> 06:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
references they used in in that
 
06:32:31.070 --> 06:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
particular chapter versus the other one
 
06:32:32.990 --> 06:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
in and we've talked about some of them
 
06:32:35.690 --> 06:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
but uh the one that says to distribute
 
06:32:37.548 --> 06:32:37.558 align:start position:0%
phase out grants to municipalities
 
06:32:41.270 --> 06:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
school districts pursuant to 194 f is
 
06:32:43.070 --> 06:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
that currently being taken out of the
 
06:32:45.650 --> 06:32:45.660 align:start position:0%
trust fund or is that out of the general
 
06:32:48.350 --> 06:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
fund so those grants are established in
 
06:32:52.910 --> 06:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
194 colon F which is part of the uh the
 
06:32:54.470 --> 06:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
education freedoms account so I cannot
 
06:32:55.910 --> 06:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
discuss that portion of this guy I'm
 
06:32:57.230 --> 06:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
sorry yep
 
06:32:59.208 --> 06:32:59.218 align:start position:0%
representative miler
 
06:33:01.850 --> 06:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I follow up to
 
06:33:04.368 --> 06:33:04.378 align:start position:0%
representative Lino's
 
06:33:04.378 --> 06:33:05.628 align:start position:0%
representative Lino's
query

06:33:05.628 --> 06:33:05.638 align:start position:0%
query
 
06:33:07.788 --> 06:33:07.798 align:start position:0%
you said that there's there's the trust
 
06:33:07.798 --> 06:33:08.990 align:start position:0%
you said that there's there's the trust
fund

06:33:08.990 --> 06:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
fund
 
06:33:11.868 --> 06:33:11.878 align:start position:0%
and there's a budget appropriation
 
06:33:15.650 --> 06:33:15.660 align:start position:0%
so clarify for me since this now comes
 
06:33:17.628 --> 06:33:17.638 align:start position:0%
under the trust fund this clarification
 
06:33:20.750 --> 06:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
here in this language is notes that the
 
06:33:24.110 --> 06:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
lease it from the trust fund how does
 
06:33:27.230 --> 06:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
the budgeted proposal and the trust fund
 
06:33:30.530 --> 06:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
work together and then my concern is
 
06:33:33.170 --> 06:33:33.180 align:start position:0%
always trying to maintain as much money
 
06:33:35.330 --> 06:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
in the trust fund to go back to Public
 
06:33:37.368 --> 06:33:37.378 align:start position:0%
Schools as possible
 
06:33:39.350 --> 06:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
so the education trust fund right now is
 
06:33:40.730 --> 06:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
part of the education department of
 
06:33:43.128 --> 06:33:43.138 align:start position:0%
education's operating budget we have
 
06:33:45.110 --> 06:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
accounting units that are paid out of
 
06:33:46.788 --> 06:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund right now
 
06:33:50.390 --> 06:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
currently those include the majority of
 
06:33:53.448 --> 06:33:53.458 align:start position:0%
what you have here in front of you
 
06:33:56.810 --> 06:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
um what it concludes what is is included
 
06:33:59.030 --> 06:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
in front of you here we have line items
 
06:34:00.410 --> 06:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
for each one of those that is
 
06:34:02.510 --> 06:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the education trust fund
 
06:34:06.650 --> 06:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
and then the program is defined as in
 
06:34:09.890 --> 06:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
law so let's
 
06:34:14.270 --> 06:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
take the first section here so where it
 
06:34:16.548 --> 06:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
talks about line four and five it talks
 
06:34:19.250 --> 06:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
about Distributing education grants to
 
06:34:21.288 --> 06:34:21.298 align:start position:0%
municipalities for public schools under
 
06:34:21.298 --> 06:34:22.390 align:start position:0%
municipalities for public schools under
RSA

06:34:22.390 --> 06:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
06:34:27.350 --> 06:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
19842 so RSA 19842 defines the program
 
06:34:29.810 --> 06:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
how the Department of Education is going
 
06:34:32.750 --> 06:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
to distribute the funding and then
 
06:34:35.570 --> 06:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
there's a line item that is an hb1
 
06:34:38.448 --> 06:34:38.458 align:start position:0%
that's that relates back to that
 
06:34:41.270 --> 06:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
specific section then you have something
 
06:34:42.830 --> 06:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
like building Aid
 
06:34:45.170 --> 06:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
and building Aid is paid out of the
 
06:34:47.990 --> 06:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund the law is
 
06:34:49.850 --> 06:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
referenced right here and then there's a
 
06:34:51.288 --> 06:34:51.298 align:start position:0%
line item corresponding in the
 
06:34:53.208 --> 06:34:53.218 align:start position:0%
department of education's hb1 budget
 
06:34:54.948 --> 06:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
that shows building Aid
 
06:34:57.530 --> 06:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
um so when we're talking about programs
 
06:35:01.670 --> 06:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
the laws around the programs are dictate
 
06:35:04.270 --> 06:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
how the Department of Education
 
06:35:06.288 --> 06:35:06.298 align:start position:0%
implements the program
 
06:35:09.890 --> 06:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
so for example State special education
 
06:35:13.610 --> 06:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
Aid which we just discussed yesterday or
 
06:35:16.070 --> 06:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
two days ago we had talked about that
 
06:35:18.708 --> 06:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
amount as prorated so
 
06:35:21.048 --> 06:35:21.058 align:start position:0%
there's an appropriated amount for State
 
06:35:23.690 --> 06:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
special education Aid in the in this in
 
06:35:25.910 --> 06:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
the hb1 language
 
06:35:28.610 --> 06:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
and if the special education costs are
 
06:35:30.590 --> 06:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
to come over that we prorate that
 
06:35:33.708 --> 06:35:33.718 align:start position:0%
because the law requires that we only
 
06:35:35.510 --> 06:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
expend the amount that is in that line
 
06:35:35.520 --> 06:35:36.708 align:start position:0%
expend the amount that is in that line
item

06:35:36.708 --> 06:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
item
 
06:35:38.030 --> 06:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:35:41.030 --> 06:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:35:42.948 --> 06:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Caitlyn
 
06:35:53.868 --> 06:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:02.690 --> 06:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:05.150 --> 06:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
hi there my name is Louise Spencer I'm
 
06:36:07.368 --> 06:36:07.378 align:start position:0%
sorry I had the time wrong for the
 
06:36:10.190 --> 06:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
hearing so just making it in under the
 
06:36:11.628 --> 06:36:11.638 align:start position:0%
wire here
 
06:36:14.330 --> 06:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate you taking my testimony
 
06:36:16.368 --> 06:36:16.378 align:start position:0%
so my name is Louise Spencer I'm from
 
06:36:18.948 --> 06:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
Concord New Hampshire I often appear
 
06:36:20.868 --> 06:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
before committees
 
06:36:23.390 --> 06:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
um with my country Coalition hat on
 
06:36:23.400 --> 06:36:24.350 align:start position:0%
um with my country Coalition hat on
today

06:36:24.350 --> 06:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:36:26.810 --> 06:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
um normally today I come with my
 
06:36:26.820 --> 06:36:28.730 align:start position:0%
um normally today I come with my
taxpayer

06:36:28.730 --> 06:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
06:36:34.090 --> 06:36:34.100 align:start position:0%
Community member hat firmly on to speak
 
06:36:38.150 --> 06:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
against this bill in the most in the
 
06:36:43.250 --> 06:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:48.110 --> 06:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
I find the hypocrisy of this bill
 
06:36:50.650 --> 06:36:50.660 align:start position:0%
really a challenge
 
06:36:54.470 --> 06:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's from people who say that they both
 
06:36:58.070 --> 06:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
support public education and at the same
 
06:37:01.970 --> 06:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
time say they're not going to raise our
 
06:37:05.690 --> 06:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
taxes well you can't do both things with
 
06:37:06.890 --> 06:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:37:09.288 --> 06:37:09.298 align:start position:0%
you're either going to take money that
 
06:37:11.590 --> 06:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
would otherwise go to public schools
 
06:37:15.970 --> 06:37:15.980 align:start position:0%
there by harming our Public Schools
 
06:37:19.010 --> 06:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
without making that money up or you're
 
06:37:21.530 --> 06:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
going to have to raise money raise extra
 
06:37:24.890 --> 06:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
taxes to cover any money that you pull
 
06:37:28.610 --> 06:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
out of the education trust fund to make
 
06:37:30.890 --> 06:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
up the difference of public schools that
 
06:37:35.030 --> 06:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
money that you're giving to the
 
06:37:35.040 --> 06:37:37.610 align:start position:0%
money that you're giving to the
educational

06:37:37.610 --> 06:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
educational
 
06:37:40.730 --> 06:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts that the vouchers
 
06:37:43.330 --> 06:37:43.340 align:start position:0%
I find this particularly
 
06:37:47.150 --> 06:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
upsetting given the failure of many on
 
06:37:50.868 --> 06:37:50.878 align:start position:0%
this committee to support any bills that
 
06:37:53.048 --> 06:37:53.058 align:start position:0%
would do accountability for that program
 
06:37:56.030 --> 06:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
so we're pulling money out of our Public
 
06:37:57.890 --> 06:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
Schools where there's so much
 
06:37:57.900 --> 06:37:59.510 align:start position:0%
Schools where there's so much
accountability

06:37:59.510 --> 06:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
06:38:02.690 --> 06:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
and we are putting we're going to allow
 
06:38:04.788 --> 06:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
this money that is currently designated
 
06:38:08.510 --> 06:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
for public schools to be given
 
06:38:12.410 --> 06:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
to homeschoolers to private schools of
 
06:38:13.970 --> 06:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
all kinds
 
06:38:17.208 --> 06:38:17.218 align:start position:0%
we have a program that that
 
06:38:19.430 --> 06:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
pulls 10 percent off the top as I
 
06:38:21.650 --> 06:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
understand it to minister it
 
06:38:24.850 --> 06:38:24.860 align:start position:0%
and we have virtually no accountability
 
06:38:28.010 --> 06:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
as a taxpayer
 
06:38:30.770 --> 06:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
I believe in paying taxes I think they
 
06:38:33.470 --> 06:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
go to the good of the community I want
 
06:38:35.690 --> 06:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
Strong's Public Schools I'm more than
 
06:38:38.750 --> 06:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
happy to to do that
 
06:38:42.170 --> 06:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
but I want accountability and I want I
 
06:38:45.590 --> 06:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
want strong public schools and we know
 
06:38:47.090 --> 06:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
06:38:48.948 --> 06:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:38:51.350 --> 06:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
this Governor has said he's not going to
 
06:38:53.690 --> 06:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
raise taxes he belongs to a party that
 
06:38:56.390 --> 06:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
says he's not going to raise taxes what
 
06:38:57.890 --> 06:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
that means is they're not going to raise
 
06:39:00.708 --> 06:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
taxes in a way that people can see it
 
06:39:03.890 --> 06:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
when they look online at the calendar of
 
06:39:05.690 --> 06:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
the legislature or they look at the
 
06:39:08.208 --> 06:39:08.218 align:start position:0%
bills that have been passed those taxes
 
06:39:10.670 --> 06:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
will be paid and they're going to be
 
06:39:13.788 --> 06:39:13.798 align:start position:0%
paid by property tax owners and sadly
 
06:39:16.430 --> 06:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
there are school districts that can't
 
06:39:16.440 --> 06:39:17.690 align:start position:0%
there are school districts that can't
afford

06:39:17.690 --> 06:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
afford
 
06:39:20.930 --> 06:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
to raise their taxes anymore to make up
 
06:39:23.628 --> 06:39:23.638 align:start position:0%
this kind of difference so I'm glad I
 
06:39:25.090 --> 06:39:25.100 align:start position:0%
made it in here
 
06:39:29.350 --> 06:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
in time uh I thought it was at 3 45
 
06:39:32.448 --> 06:39:32.458 align:start position:0%
because rarely have I
 
06:39:35.208 --> 06:39:35.218 align:start position:0%
just found a bill
 
06:39:35.218 --> 06:39:37.430 align:start position:0%
just found a bill
so

06:39:37.430 --> 06:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:39:40.850 --> 06:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
so unfair to our schools and to our
 
06:39:44.510 --> 06:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so I thank you for taking my
 
06:39:47.208 --> 06:39:47.218 align:start position:0%
my impassioned testimony
 
06:39:49.610 --> 06:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
06:39:51.770 --> 06:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
the committee yes represent McConnell
 
06:39:53.750 --> 06:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chair and thank you
 
06:39:56.868 --> 06:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I noticed that your
 
06:39:59.090 --> 06:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
objections to this bill and of a lot of
 
06:40:00.590 --> 06:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
the speakers have to do with the freedom
 
06:40:01.910 --> 06:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
accounts do you have any other
 
06:40:03.708 --> 06:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
objections to other parts of the bill so
 
06:40:05.930 --> 06:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
if it were to pass with no relation to
 
06:40:07.128 --> 06:40:07.138 align:start position:0%
the freedom accounts that just wasn't
 
06:40:09.350 --> 06:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
reference at all would you have any
 
06:40:11.330 --> 06:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
problems with a bill like that you know
 
06:40:14.030 --> 06:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
I would have to quite honestly say I'd
 
06:40:15.708 --> 06:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
have to look at the bill more in depth
 
06:40:19.190 --> 06:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's the piece of it that really got
 
06:40:22.368 --> 06:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
to me because I saw a program get
 
06:40:25.430 --> 06:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
brought before you know in hearings like
 
06:40:27.110 --> 06:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
this that was only going to cost the
 
06:40:28.850 --> 06:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
taxpayers a couple hundred thousand
 
06:40:31.250 --> 06:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
dollars per year and now we're going up
 
06:40:33.288 --> 06:40:33.298 align:start position:0%
on millions and millions and millions of
 
06:40:35.868 --> 06:40:35.878 align:start position:0%
dollars so when I see something that
 
06:40:38.030 --> 06:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
would make it even more permissive to
 
06:40:40.010 --> 06:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
spend money on that account on that
 
06:40:43.128 --> 06:40:43.138 align:start position:0%
program that's what really got me to
 
06:40:46.548 --> 06:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
drop what I was doing this afternoon and
 
06:40:48.470 --> 06:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
run over here and
 
06:40:50.750 --> 06:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
um so I but I'm happy to take a look at
 
06:40:51.708 --> 06:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
the rest of the bill and I could get
 
06:40:53.270 --> 06:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
back to you on that all right I would
 
06:40:54.948 --> 06:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you thank you
 
06:40:56.390 --> 06:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:40:57.948 --> 06:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
06:41:01.490 --> 06:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:03.948 --> 06:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
hypothetically if a charter school were
 
06:41:05.930 --> 06:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
to have to close
 
06:41:08.090 --> 06:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
and a public school had to absorb those
 
06:41:09.288 --> 06:41:09.298 align:start position:0%
students let's say double the student
 
06:41:11.208 --> 06:41:11.218 align:start position:0%
population it would it be fair to
 
06:41:12.650 --> 06:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
conclude that it would cost that public
 
06:41:14.750 --> 06:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
school considerably more money to
 
06:41:16.910 --> 06:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
administer that school with double the
 
06:41:19.628 --> 06:41:19.638 align:start position:0%
population of students
 
06:41:22.128 --> 06:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
I would think that would be a fair
 
06:41:24.170 --> 06:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
assumption if any school that has
 
06:41:27.530 --> 06:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
doubled the population of students
 
06:41:30.650 --> 06:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
went along that same line if I'm sorry
 
06:41:33.470 --> 06:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
if a public school were to lose half its
 
06:41:35.810 --> 06:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
population because parents wanted their
 
06:41:37.430 --> 06:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
children in a religious or alternative
 
06:41:39.650 --> 06:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
education is it fair to suggest that
 
06:41:41.750 --> 06:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
that would then cost the public school
 
06:41:43.788 --> 06:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
less money to administer
 
06:41:46.930 --> 06:41:46.940 align:start position:0%
no no that's a false equivalency
 
06:41:50.090 --> 06:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
bringing more students into a school by
 
06:41:53.208 --> 06:41:53.218 align:start position:0%
and large does increase the cost because
 
06:41:55.490 --> 06:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
you have to add added infrastructure
 
06:41:59.810 --> 06:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
however if there are basic requirements
 
06:42:02.948 --> 06:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
that a public school has I had personal
 
06:42:06.770 --> 06:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
experience with this of um you know my
 
06:42:08.048 --> 06:42:08.058 align:start position:0%
daughter one year
 
06:42:10.970 --> 06:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
they it looked like they were going to
 
06:42:15.590 --> 06:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
be 25 27 kids in her class in all the
 
06:42:17.330 --> 06:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
fourth grade classes a few more people
 
06:42:20.030 --> 06:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
moved in to the district they had to get
 
06:42:22.670 --> 06:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
another teacher the the public schools
 
06:42:25.368 --> 06:42:25.378 align:start position:0%
have certain responsibilities to all of
 
06:42:27.230 --> 06:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
the children in the community that's
 
06:42:29.390 --> 06:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
what makes them valuable but when you
 
06:42:32.390 --> 06:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
are simply pulling kids out and it you
 
06:42:34.788 --> 06:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
know that would be a whole new day if we
 
06:42:36.830 --> 06:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
are talking about removing half of the
 
06:42:39.048 --> 06:42:39.058 align:start position:0%
kids from a from our Public School
 
06:42:39.058 --> 06:42:40.570 align:start position:0%
kids from a from our Public School
System

06:42:40.570 --> 06:42:40.580 align:start position:0%
System
 
06:42:43.310 --> 06:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
generally it's a few kids here a few
 
06:42:45.650 --> 06:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
kids there in these classes in those
 
06:42:48.530 --> 06:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
classes but enough money that puts a
 
06:42:51.048 --> 06:42:51.058 align:start position:0%
real strain on the school to continue
 
06:42:52.910 --> 06:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs of the kids that are
 
06:42:54.590 --> 06:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
there thank you
 
06:42:56.990 --> 06:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:42:59.030 --> 06:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
not seeing me thank you very much thank
 
06:43:01.548 --> 06:43:01.558 align:start position:0%
you and sorry to keep you later then you
 
06:43:06.350 --> 06:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:08.990 --> 06:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
okay I don't have any other pink cards
 
06:43:10.850 --> 06:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
up here at this time so I'm going to
 
06:43:13.850 --> 06:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
close this hearing on 4 40.
 
06:43:16.010 --> 06:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
and that gets us to the end of the day
 
06:43:44.150 --> 06:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:44.160 --> 06:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
okay
