um a fiscal note quick guide which just
 
00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
essentially um elaborates on on the
 
00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
portion that the Department of Revenue
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
yeah let me ask a question here does
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
everybody have the January pardon
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
30 okay it's making its way around sorry
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
um so all all this really is it's a
 
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
courtesy it just elaborates on um dr's
 
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
contribution to the fiscal
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
note because especially when there's
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
multiple agencies that are contacted to
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
provide information that there's a
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
summarize does everybody also have the
 
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.270 align:start position:0%
summarize does everybody also have the
January

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
January
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
30th Amendment or fiscal note excuse me
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
Fiscal note if not we can get some
 
00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.150 align:start position:0%
Fiscal note if not we can get some
copies

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
copies
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
made pardon
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
me well it's and it's an updated one
 
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
there was an initially a fiscal note
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
dated January uary
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
13th me okay yeah okay good we're ready
 
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
to go okay okay sorry about that um so
 
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
um the first thing I just want to just
 
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
discuss um our understanding that this
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
is um for the portion as it relates to
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
the business hiring incentive program
 
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
that um this is a rebate as opposed to a
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
credit against the business Enterprise
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
tax so really um our our question to
 
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
this is this program intended to be a
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
rebate or a credit and how would that
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
work so a rebate um when the Dr
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
administers a rebate taxpayers submit a
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
claim and attach appropriate
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
documentation to demonstrate they are
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
eligible which can include proof of
 
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
payment or of a tax liability once
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
approved they receive a check from the
 
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
state so a rebate program that we
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
administer would be something like the
 
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
low and moderate uh homeowners property
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
tax relief program whereas a credit when
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
we administer a credit taxpayers submit
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
an application and attach appropriate
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
docu documentation and once approved
 
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
receive a letter confirming their
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
eligibility and the amount of credit
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
that can be claimed they then claim the
 
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
credit on the appal applicable tax
 
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
return and an example of that would be
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
the research and development tax
 
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
credit and then both a rebate anacredit
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
program can be capped it was we we are
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
assuming in this bill that there is no
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
cap on the
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
rebate um and when there is a cap on any
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
of these programs eligibility is
 
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
typically determined first and then when
 
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
the application period or program year
 
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:13.879 align:start position:0%
closes the amount of credit or rebate is
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
determined based upon the cap and then
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
in these cases the taxpayer receives two
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
letters and some programs are
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
administered first come first serve and
 
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
some are administered so that
 
00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
distribution of funds or credits are
 
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
done on a pra basis
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
so that's where we were just looking for
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
some clarity in the language of the bill
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
and then also an additional issue for
 
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
credit programs is on what return or
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
Returns the credit can be claimed for
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
some programs the credit is only claimed
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
in the year after issuance if a
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
taxpayer's tax liability is less than
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of the credit that can be
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
claimed the remaining credit is not used
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
for other programs the credit can be
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
carried forward for some number of years
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
and some credits may even be
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
transferable between taxpayers or
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
between taxes so it was also we assumed
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
while reading the proposed legislation
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
that um this rebate would not carry
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
forward so then if someone is awarded
 
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
more rebate then they have liability
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
they would not receive all of it and
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
then um we all are also making an
 
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
assumption that um the Department of
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
Business and economics Affairs is the
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
one that is administering the
 
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
rebate and that it's not the Dr it was
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
not clear in the legislation who the
 
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
department was in that section of the
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
then and then also we are also making an
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
assumption that this part of the program
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
is effective for tax years beginning on
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
or after December 31st
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
2025 but um with that that is a an
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
assumption that we do suggest some
 
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
clarifying language for Which tax years
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
the rebate has become effective for
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
administration and um if there are and
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
then also just one thing I want to note
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
for those who aren't familiar with the
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax credit against
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax um any program
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
that reduces the BET then also reduces
 
00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:24.519 align:start position:0%
the credit to the business profits tax
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
so if a taxpayer has liability for both
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
taxes a decrease in bet can
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
theoretically be an increase in the
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
business profits tax but that's only in
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
those cases where the taxpayer has
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
liability for both taxes so for those
 
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
who aren't aware I'd let you
 
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
know okay um any questions thank you
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
very much for giving us some of your
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
concerns and issues associated with this
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
interpretation are there any questions
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
Dr yes represent Damon thank you Mr
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
chair I actually just want to ask you to
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
re repeat what you just stated about the
 
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
impact on BET from a BPT correct sure so
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
any I'll actually read this word for
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
word and this is also in the quick guide
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it's also in the fiscal note
 
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:20.839 align:start position:0%
too in case you didn't capture at all
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
any program reducing bet will also
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
reduce the BET credit available to
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
offset the business profits tax there by
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
increasing the business profits tax
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
revenue however the BBT increase will be
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
less than the BET decrease because not
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
all taxpayers have a business pro uh
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
profits tax liability to be offset by
 
00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
the BET credit and that all taxpayers
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
bet liability exceeds the BBT Credit in
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
those situations the BET loss and
 
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
revenue is not fully offset by an
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
increase in business profits tax
 
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.590 align:start position:0%
increase in business profits tax
liability

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
does that does that help answer your
 
00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959 align:start position:0%
question it will when I read it again
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you okay Bas essentially they're
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
not it's not one for
 
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
one yes represent papovich thank you
 
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
just a very brief question billing on
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
what you said and if you have the answer
 
00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
off the C great if not no stress but in
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
that situation where the impact is
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
maximized right the reduction in the the
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
rebate towards the BET then Ates the
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of BPT possible what
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
would be that ratio so for every $100 in
 
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
a bet credit what's the most we would
 
00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
ever get under the most Rosy scenario in
 
00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:42.910 align:start position:0%
ever get under the most Rosy scenario in
B

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
B
 
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
PT so um so let's say before the rebate
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
or the credit if someone has $100 in bet
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
liability and $200 in BBT liability the
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
BET credit against the BBT would reduce
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
that 200 by the
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
$100 however if someone had let's say
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
it's the other way and they have $50 in
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
BBT liability only $50 of that bet
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
liability can offset that but then
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
there's um a carry forward provision
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
where um the next year if um that credit
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
can roll forward and be used against the
 
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
next tax Year's BBT
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
liability thank you as a former CPA I
 
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
love those levels of details so thank
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
you no problem further questions from
 
00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:31.590 align:start position:0%
you no problem further questions from
the

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee what do you expect the would
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
be the cost for administering this
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
program by the Department of Business
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
and economic Affairs um is that cost
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
included in this dollar amount we're
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
we're seeing here um I cannot speak to
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
what business and economic Affairs has
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
written what their cost to administer
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
the program would be but um for for the
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
Dr in order to um update any necessary
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
tax form forms or electronic Management
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
Systems we have the rim system or any
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
Communications to taxpayers that can be
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
absorbed in the our current budget and
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
with our current Staffing it can be abor
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
absorbed into current Staffing
 
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
yep see in dbea they're saying they need
 
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
additional Staffing to do this well
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
that's well that is um the question is
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
who's administering it but just for us
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
Granite tax connect system accept that
 
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
information when we're determining the
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
tax liability that the Dr can absorb
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
that thank you I can't speak on behalf

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
of this hearing this morning so I just
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
rushed in uh from Amherst um uh I I kind
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
of was there uh this build wasn't my
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
idea but I was kind of there as he was
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
um developing it uh I um I was a field
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
organizer with the New Hampshire uh
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
Democratic party and I helped him get
 
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
elected which is why like we have that
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
relationship so um one of the things
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
that this bill is trying to solve is
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
that we have a huge outflow of young
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
people uh once they graduate from
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
college um so 48 to 56% of graduates
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
leave the state after graduation and in
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire our our
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
largest demographic growth is in
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
seniors um just people aging uh in the
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
state people leave because there are um
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
more economic opportunities outside the
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
state whether it be Massachusetts or
 
00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:14.919 align:start position:0%
other states and people don't generally
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
come back um New Hampshire is actually
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
the number one state in the country for
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
graduates leaving the state after
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
graduation so this bill is trying to you
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
know take a bite out of that problem
 
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
trying to incentivize people to stay
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
here after the graduate and trying to
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
incentivize businesses to hire people um
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
and with a pretty strong incentive to
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
hire uh
 
00:19:40.919 --> 00:19:42.510 align:start position:0%
hire uh
interns

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
interns
 
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
um and sji wanted to mention how uh the
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
people who do come to this state tend to
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
be people who are coming here safe for
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because say the nsha
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
housing prices are a little bit lower so
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
it drives up the housing prices um
 
00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:02.919 align:start position:0%
so we really need to keep that talent
 
00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:05.559 align:start position:0%
that young talent in the state um we
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
don't have that uh right now again we
 
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
are the number one state for graduates
 
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
leaving and and this seeks to uh respond
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
to that problem
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
questions you you finished I am finished
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much other questions
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent pap
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for the
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
effort of coming in on short notice and
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
letting us know what's going on no
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
reason um you were quoting a 48 to 56%
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
of graduate living the state yes is that
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents who are college
 
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
graduates or all college graduates that
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
graduate from New Hampshire colleges I
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I uh I you would have to ask
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
Sanji if um no worry I was just curious
 
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
if if I any chance you knew I I
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate it that's all I had thank you
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you for being here thank you
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um
 
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
so it speaks about a $5,000 annual
 
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
student loan
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
forgiveness to graduates who commit to a
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
minimum of three consecutive years of
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
employment within the state and then
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
says the total forgiveness amount shall
 
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
not exceed $20,000 per
 
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.990 align:start position:0%
not exceed $20,000 per
individual

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.870 align:start position:0%
 
awarding

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
awarding
 
00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
$20,000 and The Graduate might only stay
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
three years I feel like there's a $5,000
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
discrepancy there yeah um now that you
 
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
pointed out I do find that interesting
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I mean
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh I let me tell you I've talked to OS
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
they they're crazy busy all the time
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
it's possible it's it's their oversight
 
00:21:57.269 --> 00:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
it's possible that uh it's s ch's
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
oversight um uh let me tell you in terms
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the details I'm sure sanie would uh
 
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
would work with you in terms of like you
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
know the the core goal is what he wants
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
preserved you know incentivizing uh
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
graduates to stay in the state um not
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
specific details thank you f further
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you um I I
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
don't mean to put you on the spot it's
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
okay um did did you have any discussions
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
or do any research on where the the the
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
graduates go that don't stay in New
 
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.070 align:start position:0%
graduates go that don't stay in New
Hampshire

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
and right um so as I said my uh
 
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is is a little bit surface
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
level right now but I believe most of
 
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
them go to Massachusetts you
 
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
know yes and do you have any idea why
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
they go would go to Massachusetts yeah
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
Economic Opportunity there are more jobs
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
there okay maybe sorry eom yeah economic
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
such as followup paron me followup one
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
more sure go ahead economic such as the
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
salary they could earn
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
yes further questions from the
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing anything oh yes
 
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.350 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing anything oh yes
represent

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
Brown thanks for
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
coming so the um the bill mentions
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
education is one of the eligible High
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
need fields
 
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
um but then later on in the the bill it
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
states that this is mainly targeted to
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
businesses small and mediumsized
 
00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
businesses but in most towns the school
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
district is the largest
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
employer um so I'm just wondering would
 
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
a public school be eligible to
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
included um again I think that this is
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
something that uh
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
can you can you specify where in the
 
00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
definitions uh the first
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
page eligible High eligible High need
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
Fields means occupations in Health Care
 
00:24:21.149 --> 00:24:21.159 align:start position:0%

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
and education and then the small and
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
mediumsized businesses I know i' I've
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
read that do you remember where that is
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:44.110 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
uh sorry that's
 
00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:50.669 align:start position:0%
uh sorry that's
uh

00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.110 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:25:09.389 --> 00:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
see it says priority so I'm not
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
sure it it uh stops um you know
 
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
education from being
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
incentivized i i in terms of his
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
intention I can't say specifically um
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
when I talked to him about it he didn't
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
talk about this like specifically I'm
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
sure that he would be uh more than
 
00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
willing to adapt some kind of language
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
that would clarify um what kind of uh
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
businesses are
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
eligible for further questions from the
 
00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:39.159 align:start position:0%

00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
Act I don't know about it I'm sure he
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
can speak to
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
it represent kcom thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question can you
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
just clarify I don't know if I heard you
 
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
correctly before did you say you were
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
going to contact o about something can
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
you just explain what you were going to
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
contact OSS about no I'm not going to
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
contact OS I was just surmising why
 
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
there was a discrepancy between um the
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
5,000 per year uh loan forgiveness and
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
the total of $20,000 per individual that
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
there was a discrepancy because you
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
would expect it to be $15,000 per
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
individual um I was just guessing what
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
could have happened there I'm not
 
00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:50.919 align:start position:0%
planning to contact I thought I heard
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
you say that you were going to contact
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
OS so I was just getting clarification
 
00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
thank you I I have spoken to OS many
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
times that's what I was talking
 
00:26:58.799 --> 00:26:59.870 align:start position:0%
times that's what I was talking
yeah

00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
sorry I I got a question we have um
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
within the university system granted
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
guarantee which is a grant which takes
 
00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
care of the tuition okay of students
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
which are coming from a certain level of
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
income okay would this program be
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
available to those which are also
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
receiving that
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
Grant as written I don't see why not but
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
I don't see why an amendment couldn't be
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
written to uh um to take care of those
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
cases thank you no words further
 
00:27:33.559 --> 00:27:36.029 align:start position:0%
cases thank you no words further
represent

00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
Amon um can you speak to what if any
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
other states have programs similar to
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
this or to any part of this since
 
00:27:48.509 --> 00:27:48.519 align:start position:0%
there's clearly three um sort of three
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
programs in
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
here um well so as I said I I was
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
talking to him as he was writing this
 
00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
bill coming up with a concept for it um
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
I don't remember him referring
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
specifically to any other um states with
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
similar programs um however the the way
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's funded um with with Lottery uh
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
money um because this is education
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
related that would be a pretty standard
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
way of of funding um in other states as
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
well from my understanding um but no I
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
don't know of of other states with
 
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.750 align:start position:0%
don't know of of other states with
similar

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
programs thank you any further questions
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%

new new people great to see you as well
 
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
um this bill was presented uh last
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
session it is uh the complete idea of a
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
constituent uh from conquer who's now in
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
college at the time she was a high
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
school student she now at Harvard uh
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
down at Harvard um and it's simple in
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
this way um the details maybe are not
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
but uh really was to look at three key
 
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
components that we call the um you know
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
the triple uh play so um um one it's to
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
increase uh interest in and activity
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
among high school students at whether
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
regardless of where or how they attend
 
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
high school to uh do service projects or
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
become interns and volunteers with uh as
 
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
you know in high school so to increase
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
service programs which a lot of high
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
schools have um you know like a whole
 
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
junior year service project but to
 
00:46:28.349 --> 00:46:28.359 align:start position:0%
increase that sort of thing across the
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
state um to
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
engage uh high school students in a way
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
that this is the second part to earn
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
tuition credits for our state
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
institutions of Higher Learning here in
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh three to increase
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
access to
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
Affordable um attendance at said
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
University by giving college credits for
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
having done this volunteer work so that
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%

00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
Vol increasing
 
00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.030 align:start position:0%

the Crux of it um I there were many

great suggestions that were um made as
 
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
this bill was I believe
 
00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.390 align:start position:0%
this bill was I believe
retained

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
retained
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I have those notes so I
 
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
need to track those down but um I would
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
recommend retaining the bill for that
 
00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:34.670 align:start position:0%

policy my sister Morgan and I have
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
worked with representative Schultz on
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
this bill over the last year and a half
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
to make higher education attainable and
 
00:48:55.549 --> 00:48:55.559 align:start position:0%
affordable to everyone interested in
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
pursuing it
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
over 43 million Americans hold federal
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
student loans totaling over $1.7
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
trillion with 74% of New Hampshire
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
college graduates facing student loan
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
debt this proposal aims to Institute a
 
00:49:14.589 --> 00:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
unique option for tuition credit to
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
alleviate future loan debt within our
 
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
state it also provides value in serving
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
the community and getting to know New
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire outside of the
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
classroom House Bill 770 benefits three
 
00:49:26.839 --> 00:49:27.829 align:start position:0%
classroom House Bill 770 benefits three
groups

00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
groups
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
significantly first New Hampshire
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
students gain a unique opportunity to
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
avoid heav heavy student loan debt
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
through community service exposing
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
students to the challenges faced by
 
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
others would promote a heightened
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
awareness of of the broader Community
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
second communities benefit from
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic students engaging in
 
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
volunteer work especially in areas
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
facing staff shortages consistent
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
support throughout the year would yield
 
00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:57.079 align:start position:0%
a greater impact than sporadic help
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
third the state of New Hampshire would
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
benefit from this policy by encouraging
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
ambitious young adults to pursue higher
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
education locally increased volunteer
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
work would create valuable connections
 
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
for future employment and motivate
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
students to engage with
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
nonprofits by studying and building
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
relations in state these students are
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
more likely to establish permanent
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
careers in New Hampshire helping to
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
retain exceptional
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
talent I believe this proposed
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
legislation has the potential for
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
transformative change it encourages
 
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
volunteer work strengthens communities
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
and helps alleviate student loan burdens
 
00:50:35.549 --> 00:50:35.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could set an example for
 
00:50:37.549 --> 00:50:37.559 align:start position:0%
other states with this triple win policy
 
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
which reflects a compromise between
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
Democrats and Republicans I urge New
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Congress to consider this and
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
pass this Bill thank you thank you very
 
00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
much are there questions from the
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
committee represent fellows um yes I'm I
 
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
just read it quickly but it's it sounds
 
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
like the people who are eligible could
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
be somebody from out of state attending
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
a a CO College in New Hampshire no the
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
the idea is that it's only available to
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire High School students to
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
University oh okay further questions
 
00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
from the commit represent
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
you for coming and testifying I know
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
it's not always easy to uh you know be
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
on camera and in front of a committee um
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
you ended your um testimony by saying
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
this is a compromise between the
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
Democrats and the Republicans could you
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
help me understand a bit more what did
 
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
you mean specifically by
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
that yes I think that um there's a
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
democratic side that uh they want
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
student Lo forgiveness and
 
00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
there's been proponents of Simply
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
erasing a lot of student loans and I
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
think that this um satisfies the
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
Republican side of the argument
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
because while it's helping
 
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
students or alleviate their student
 
00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:16.799 align:start position:0%
loans there is also benefit to the
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
community and through this volunteer
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
work thank you that's very insightful I
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate it further questions from the
 
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.510 align:start position:0%
appreciate it further questions from the
committee

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um Mr chair and thank you

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um and then maybe
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
this is a question for the
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative but um it says that high
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
school students attending private high
 
00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
schools or prep schools would not be
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
eligible and can you speak to that why
 
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
eligible well says high school students
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
attending private high schools or
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
preparatory schools shall not be
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
wait a minute let's let's let's we may
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
want to ask that question to the prime
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor here in a second but uh are
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
there any more questions for the Mr
 
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:13.470 align:start position:0%
there any more questions for the Mr
Casey

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh you said
 
00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
you're a senior in high school I'm a
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
junior you're a junior in high school um
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
If This Were offered to you would you be
 
00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
more attracted to go to New Hampshire
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
University yeah
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
at your school you're going to a public
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
school no I go to Bishop Brady Bishop
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
Brady okay U follow up question let's
 
00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
let's let's say conquer high so so are
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
you at Bishop Brady are you required to
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
do community service yes I'm required to
 
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
do 25 so this would actually give give
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
more compensation for the for the
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
service that you're actually required to
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
do then I think that the um some of the
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
revisions we made to the bill were to
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
exclude all mandatory service hours for
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh schools I appreciate what you did
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
questions not see you thank you very
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
much I also could address the question
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
on you may yes public school students I
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
think that the main idea behind that was
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
because public school students are um
 
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
definitely from New Hampshire whereas
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
prep schools take students from all
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
across the country and sometimes other
 
00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:25.799 align:start position:0%
countries and then private schools as
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
well can
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
um have students from the nearby States
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
attending thank you very
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
much not see any other questions thank
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
you and uh I'll right back represent
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.589 --> 00:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
asked are you satisfied with that
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
response okay fine so no need to come
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
back thank you uh I don't have any other
 
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
pck cards I have one though from the
 
00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
Department for technical report on this
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
bill uh Steve Appleby Steve would you
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
forward thank you Mr chair members of
 
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
the committee Steve applebe Department
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
of Education um we had submitted a
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but I we must have missed
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
the deadline because it didn't make it I
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
noticed in the attachment it looks like
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
um I would be happy to read the fiscal
 
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
note language if that would be of help
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
um I do have a
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
revised uh fiscal note 23 February 3 I
 
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
have an initial fiscal note of
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
128 uh I'm that doesn't look like the
 
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
costs have changed a heck of a lot so
 
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
would you please speak to those y so um
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
thank you the the fiscal note that I had
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
submitted that um stated that the
 
00:55:57.549 --> 00:55:57.559 align:start position:0%
department would need we estimate uh at
 
00:55:59.549 --> 00:55:59.559 align:start position:0%
least three full-time staff members to
 
00:56:01.029 --> 00:56:01.039 align:start position:0%
implement the proposed system and to
 
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
track the hours and students uh the
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
staff for cost uh and there was a cost
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
worksheet attached would be between 100
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
500,000 a year um the total number of
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
Staff needed Beyond this is
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
indeterminant as it is unknown how many
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
students up to
 
00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
1253 seniors this year uh could take
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
advantage of this and would be eligible
 
00:56:24.029 --> 00:56:24.039 align:start position:0%
and we further don't know how many
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
post-secondary students um could be
 
00:56:25.799 --> 00:56:26.789 align:start position:0%
post-secondary students um could be
eligible

00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
additionally we would need to set up a
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
tracking system some type of software
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
product that would then need to be
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
maintained to track this uh and this
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
stems from the wording um beginning
 
00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 6 the commissioner of the
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Education shall adopt
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
rules um relative to approved volunteer
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
sites participating schools and inations
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
of higher education student eligibility
 
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
criteria and distribution of tuition
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
credits um Department shall also develop
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
forms in collaboration with the
 
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
participating organizations and
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
educational institutions to Document
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
program participant participation and
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
volunteer service so that would lead us
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
to believe that we would uh uh need need
 
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
staff to implement this program so um
 
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
because we we imagine that we would have
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
to go out and visit sites to make sure
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
that they complied with some set of
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
rules and then um track track students
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
and work with institutions on the
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
credits so so I just wanted to make sure
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
that the committee was aware of that are
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
there questions yes represent spillsbury
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you uh do you interpret this the
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
way that I do uh that it would be the
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
department of education's responsibility
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
for approving uh the various volunteer
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
sites or organizations and would have to
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
keep one Statewide Master list for every
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
Community or District yes uh thank you
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
for the question yes that that is how we
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
interpreted this that that's sounds like
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
a very large job just to even gather the
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
information let alone to uh tabulate it
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
follow up yes and uh you mentioned the
 
00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
12,500 or so uh seniors but as I read
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
the bill any high school student would
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
be able to get started on this as as
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
early as ninth grade and accumulate
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
credits for the ultimate graduation and
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
and college Years so wouldn't that
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
number be perhaps four times as
 
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
many yes thank you it could be I had to
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
start somewhere so I I pick seniors okay
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
thank you represent fellows um yes my
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
question is how this might coordinate
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
with other um programs that we already
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
have as in incentives to stay in for
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
high school students to to go to um
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
higher education in New Hampshire so can
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
you tell us what the current programs
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
are is there still some kind of um
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
tuition reduction for student that that
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
graduate in the top tier of their class
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
or any programs like that uh thank you
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
for the question representative so um
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
there may be some programs at the local
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
college level are that are in in place
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
for students but at the Statewide level
 
00:59:21.029 --> 00:59:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
programs yes represent Damon thank you
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for being here and
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
helping us
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
1253 number that's the number of high
 
00:59:31.319 --> 00:59:32.430 align:start position:0%
1253 number that's the number of high
school

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
seniors uh well it says 24 so last year
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
that's the total
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
number so then this calculation is based
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
on thinking that all of those High
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
School seniors are going to stay in New
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and go to one of our uh state
 
00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.150 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and go to one of our uh state
funded

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
institutions again thank
 
00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
you not probable but we also don't have
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
visibility into how many stay how many
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
go so um that
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
12503 number is a worst case scenario um
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
but likewise as uh the representative
 
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
said that's only one grade of the four
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
and then there's also an eligibility
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
component with the existing
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
postsecondary students in our public
 
01:00:12.559 --> 01:00:14.470 align:start position:0%
postsecondary students in our public
colleges

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
so uh we really it's it's it could be
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
very little cost or it could be tens of
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of students we really don't
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
have a a good
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
idea yes
 
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
may do we have data on how many New
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire graduating seniors do stay in
 
01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:38.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for higher ed not and
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
whether they stay and go to community
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
collegey University or private
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
institutions yes we do have some data on
 
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
that um numbers off the top of my head I
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
can get them to the chair to share with
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
the committee thank
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%

education and this is one of those in
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%

welcome thank you Mr chair members of
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%

Department of Education um just a quick
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
background on the higher education
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
commission um this years ago was was
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
called the postsecondary education
 
01:31:30.669 --> 01:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
commission and then in 2011 morphed into
 
01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
the higher education commission uh the
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
commission's responsibilities include
 
01:31:39.149 --> 01:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
rul making around um uh private colleges
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
licensed postsecondary vocational career
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
schools so if you think um a HVAC school
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
or a computer training school or dog we
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
have dog grooming training schools that
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
teach folks how to um uh make a vocation
 
01:31:59.109 --> 01:31:59.119 align:start position:0%
of something um as the chair pointed out
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh the commission also approves new
 
01:32:03.870 --> 01:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
colleges which then come to this body to
 
01:32:06.189 --> 01:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
be um given degree granting Authority
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire uh and
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
lastly uh the committee oversees the
 
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
administration of a very small
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship for Orphans uh veterans um
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
that scholarship is up to $2,500 a year
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
we get 10,000 a year um in our budget to
 
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
award so up to
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
it could be more than four students but
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
we've never had more than two um due to
 
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
other programs available to those
 
01:32:31.950 --> 01:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
individuals so that's in nutshell what
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
the committee does uh the commission
 
01:32:36.669 --> 01:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
does the commission is made up of
 
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
college presidents um licensed Career
 
01:32:43.229 --> 01:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
School representatives and lay members
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
as well as um within the college
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
President piece there's uh public
 
01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
College positions that are in statute
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
and then there are a number of private
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
college seats and how that works is the
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire College University Council
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
makes a recommendation to the governor's
 
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
office the governor's office then um
 
01:33:02.830 --> 01:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
brings that recommendation to the
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
executive Council for appointment to the
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
commission the purpose of this bill and
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
this is not um my language this was
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
language that was given to me as I was
 
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
just discussing um is to fix a small
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
issue that has arisen the last few years
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
and that is if an appointed
 
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
non-statutory position so right now for
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
example the two chancellors of our
 
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
public College systems are specifically
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
named to this
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
commission this does not affect them
 
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
this affects those other seats where the
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
governor's office makes the nomination
 
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
um so for example a private college
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
president or a lay
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
person if that member doesn't formally
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
resign the way the current uh statute is
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
written the governor's office
 
01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
interpretate has historically
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
interpretated this as they are on the
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
commission until they resign
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
so striking that language which became
 
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
the Genesis of this bill would fix that
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
problem so if if an individual who is on
 
01:34:03.679 --> 01:34:04.790 align:start position:0%
problem so if if an individual who is on
the

01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:06.590 align:start position:0%
the
commission

01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
um doesn't formally resign they move out
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
of state they retire they become
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
medically incapacitated and by the way
 
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
these are all current situations that we
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
have the governor's office feels they
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
cannot reappoint someone to fill that
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
position because they don't have a
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
formal resignation so
 
01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
that said I recognize there are some
 
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
questions that have Arisen so we may
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
want to do some more work on the wording
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
and consult um consult councel so that
 
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
we get the wording exactly right and we
 
01:34:37.709 --> 01:34:37.719 align:start position:0%
don't have any unintended consequences
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
so so if you could hang loose there then
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask representative F he he
 
01:34:45.390 --> 01:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
brought some concerns to me right now
 
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
and I know he spoke with you let's talk
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit right
 
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:55.229 --> 01:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
chair I'd be happy to present my
 
01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
concerns but I'll tell you that I came
 
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
to a conclusion as to a better solution
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
than what we have here but I will
 
01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
express my concerns and then I think you
 
01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
ought just put it all on the table here
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
because I kind of it's hard to
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
understand what we're trying to do here
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
fair enough so a as I read this original
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
statute before we've crossed out the
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
part we crossed out is that a member
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
who's appointed uh serves the 5 years
 
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
term is ended and now the governor and
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
Council are obliged or are supposed to
 
01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
appoint a replacement they haven't
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
gotten around to it so the member can
 
01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
stay on so basically Beyond The
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
Five-Year period as I understand what uh
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
Mr applebe just explained to us the
 
01:35:48.669 --> 01:35:48.679 align:start position:0%
problem they're trying to solve is a
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
member either is no longer active in the
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
middle of that five-year period or for
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
instance moves out of state in the
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
middle of that fiveyear period and in
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
either case doesn't formally resign so
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
the governor cannot reappoint somebody
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
so so I read it as what the goal is is
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
to solve a problem that's happening
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
midterm I.E between zero and 5 years as
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to this which seems to be
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
killing the possibility for a person to
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
stay on Beyond 5 years until their
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
position is filled by the governor so
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay that's where I'm coming from in
 
01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:29.320 align:start position:0%
terms of my concern about this I have a
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
question though for Mr Appleby if I may
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead so would it be possible to
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
Simply uh eliminate the commission and
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
Grant the what the few authorities that
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
are left to the
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education y thank you
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
for the question um it would be I mean
 
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
i i before I let that go with another
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
one representa just posed something that
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
I you know if we look at everything that
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
this commission does when we're talking
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
about the presidents that are on this
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
the chancellors which are on this we're
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with nii we're dealing with with
 
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
the accreditation process and we're
 
01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the the fiscal backing of
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
various people that are applying to
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
become a college or university or or an
 
01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
adult ed type training program in the
 
01:37:40.990 --> 01:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
state other words a person pays their
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
tuition to go to school and then they go
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
bankrupt how do they get their tuition
 
01:37:45.550 --> 01:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
money back so what's the bonding and all
 
01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
that we're going to place all this on
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
one commissioner or are we going to put
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
it on um
 
01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.470 align:start position:0%
it on um
these

01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I guess if we're going to
 
01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
go that way then we got to really do
 
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
some work here um the other thing is
 
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
there's 12
 
01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.430 align:start position:0%
there's 12
appointed

01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
members those appointed
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
members also have responsibilities where
 
01:38:15.149 --> 01:38:15.159 align:start position:0%
it says I'm looking at where six
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
representes of the private four-year
 
01:38:18.830 --> 01:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
colleges in New Hampshire appointed by
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
the governor of Council on
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation by New Hampshire college
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
and university council with no more than
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
one representative from any one
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
college what happens if the commissioner
 
01:38:33.149 --> 01:38:33.159 align:start position:0%
decides to haul off and go to West
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
Virginia and no longer work for White
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
Mountain Community College or for one of
 
01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.350 align:start position:0%
Mountain Community College or for one of
those

01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
system can they be a commissioner if
 
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
they're no longer from one uh one
 
01:38:48.109 --> 01:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
college and I'm assuming any one college
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's a college in our
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
state not something in West Virginia
 
01:38:56.589 --> 01:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
so I I guess can you explain that a
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
little bit to us then I'm going to go
 
01:39:00.669 --> 01:39:00.679 align:start position:0%
with the questions
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
and yeah yeah so thank you I I think
 
01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
just to clarify if I understand the
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
question what's are you asking what's
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
the difference if a Chancellor were to
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
leave versus a private college President
 
01:39:17.589 --> 01:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
and this language right is that I'm not
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
worried about the chancellor leaving I'm
 
01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
not worried about the college President
 
01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
leaving because they will be replaced
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
either by interim or what have you by
 
01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:26.390 align:start position:0%
either by interim or what have you by
the

01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:30.109 --> 01:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
trustees I'm concerned about the a
 
01:39:33.629 --> 01:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
person appointed by the governor and
 
01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
councel that in conjunction with the
 
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
rest of that sentence uh with no more
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
than one represent from any one college
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
so you don't don't want two people
 
01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
representing you know the same
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
college so they have to be a
 
01:39:52.109 --> 01:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
representative of a college is do we
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
have something wrong in our language
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
chair should be a college in New
 
01:39:59.709 --> 01:39:59.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no so no um elsewhere we
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
specify resident of the state as I read
 
01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:03.790 align:start position:0%
specify resident of the state as I read
it

01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
but if one of those six were to leave
 
01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
were to leave their position at their
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
college become medically incapacitated
 
01:40:15.149 --> 01:40:15.159 align:start position:0%
no longer be a resident of the state
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the reason and they don't
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
submit a
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
formal resignation to the governor's
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
office the governor's office as of last
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
fall did not feel comfortable appointing
 
01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
a new person even if their term had
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
expired because the the language up
 
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
above the language up above
 
01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:37.910 align:start position:0%
above the language up above
States

01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
States
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
um the terms of appointed members except
 
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
as otherwise indicated above so those
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
would be the the public college
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
appointees and the the commissioner of
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
education and so forth um the terms of
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
appointed members except as otherwise
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
indicated above shall be for five years
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
qualified the next sentence okay
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
vacancies yeah of course there wouldn't
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
be a vacancy because they're they
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
haven't vacated yeah so I think that
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
their hangup
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
is their hangup is and until the
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
successor is appointed and verified so
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's that
 
01:41:23.669 --> 01:41:23.679 align:start position:0%
and I again I'm not an attorney May Mr
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
yeah because he okay so it sounds like I
 
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
can see how this would work it sounds
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
like well we'll let him hang out there
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
in Utah or wherever until this five
 
01:41:34.350 --> 01:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
years and then his terms expired so that
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
it's that's how they're fixing the
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
problem but that still potentially
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
leaves four years 11 months 30 days of
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
an empty seat so this still doesn't seem
 
01:41:44.669 --> 01:41:44.679 align:start position:0%
quite right and just to follow my
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
earlier question how many or my earlier
 
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
point when you talk about the
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
authorities of this commission what
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
authorities are
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
what what what is the totality of the
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
authorities that the commission
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
currently has yes so
 
01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.910 align:start position:0%
currently has yes so
um

01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
approving uh colleges or universities so
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
that then they can come before the
 
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
legislature to gain degree granting
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
Authority um so that's that's one scope
 
01:42:13.589 --> 01:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
of responsibility also um
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
overseeing postsecondary licensed
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
vocational career schools and that
 
01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
process we have a set of administrative
 
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
rules governing that process um admin
 
01:42:24.669 --> 01:42:24.679 align:start position:0%
during the war in
 
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
scholarship those are the three primary
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
areas of responsibility for the higher
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
education commission and of course Ru
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
making around to govern all of
 
01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
that so thank you could you just and
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
then represent spb could you please
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
explain to what we have done we've
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
approved the American college in Lebanon
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
we've uh approved colleges in Italy
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
we've approved Cornell as a recognized
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
College in the state even though they're
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
not planted here they're authorized to
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
function here right um is that not a
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
very real important issue to ensure
 
01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
these places were approving meet all the
 
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
standards expective of a higher
 
01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:05.830 align:start position:0%
standards expective of a higher
education

01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
institution so um we have there have
 
01:43:10.589 --> 01:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
been two new colleges in the last seven
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
years started within our state both
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
online colleges um my office um led the
 
01:43:18.990 --> 01:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
review teams of both of those colleges
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the commission and then
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
presented the findings to the commission
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh and um the results of that that
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
review of those two institutions and did
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
look at things like Financial Security
 
01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
and bonding and programmatic efficacy um
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
their mission you know what they they
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
see themselves doing so the office did
 
01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
do that work on behalf of the commission
 
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
then presented to the commission uh we
 
01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
do have colleges non non-public or
 
01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
private colleges um both in New
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as we have two
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
currently overseas that are approved
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
helenic American and um university of
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
MBA American University of MBA and we do
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
not anticipate getting any more foreign
 
01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
institutions at this time because Nei
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
has changed how they accredit it used to
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
be for a foreign non- us institution to
 
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
gain Nei accreditation Nei is the
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
regional accreditor for many of most of
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
our colleges in our state uh it used to
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
be to gain
 
01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:19.239 align:start position:0%
accreditation through Nei you had to had
 
01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
State approval first and Nei has
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
repealed that rule so now now uh the
 
01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
third college that we were working with
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
several years ago that was overseas has
 
01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
since um pulled out of getting our
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
approval and is just working directly
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
with Nei so um we don't anticipate any
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
more foreign institutions like what we
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
used to see years ago um but with regard
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
to within the state if the chair wanted
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
to start a new college tomorrow um the
 
01:44:49.870 --> 01:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
process is uh we have a bunch of forms
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the chair would submit those forms
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
on behalf of his Institution
 
01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
we would then set up a time to conduct a
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
review and then we would present those
 
01:44:59.589 --> 01:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
findings to the commission um and if
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
approved then that institution could
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
seek a legislative sponsor to gain
 
01:45:06.990 --> 01:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
degree granting Authority from the
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
state represent spillsbury
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so when I read the
 
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
bill as drafted I assumed that it was
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
addressing a holdover problem when I
 
01:45:21.629 --> 01:45:21.639 align:start position:0%
listen to you I hear that it's uh really
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
meant to address a a inactive members
 
01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
problem perhaps it should be Rewritten
 
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:45:34.109 --> 01:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
both and uh so my question is
 
01:45:36.589 --> 01:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
um how important is the problem should
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
we work on revising this or should we
 
01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:39.709 align:start position:0%
we work on revising this or should we
abandon

01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
abandon
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
it thank you for the question well um we
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
currently have two
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
seats that are that are an
 
01:45:50.830 --> 01:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
issue where individuals have left the
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
state no longer represent institutions
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
one is I Ally incapacitated so we still
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
have we have two current issues that are
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
still on the commission that can't exit
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
off oh yes okay so you're saying you'd
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
like a bill now as to making a bill that
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
will actually do what you
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
want um I I'm certainly been involved in
 
01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
any number of organizations that have a
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
rule such as uh if a member is uh
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
inactive for three or more meetings and
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know you can you can uh uh play with
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
that variable um then in effect the seat
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
becomes vacant is deemed vacant that
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
still begs the question that this last
 
01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
sentence vacancies shall be filled for
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
an unexpired term that doesn't really
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
say how and when and by whom um so
 
01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it make sense to flesh each of
 
01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
those thoughts
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
out yes thank
 
01:46:51.149 --> 01:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
you and would he be willing to do
 
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
it would you care to work
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
with thank you I welcome the opportunity
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank thank you very
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
much represent
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
bricky so you we have two seats do like
 
01:47:08.189 --> 01:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
does the commission reach out to those
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and say hey what's
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
up yes and they don't yes well that's
 
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
thanks represent Burton uh just a quick
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
half a century ago Governor sonono uh
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
had me represent him because they were
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
looking at a new program at a trade
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
school is that do they do just new
 
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
institutions or do they do programs also
 
01:47:40.510 --> 01:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
that not commission that would be a a a
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
question for so um the commission does
 
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
not have jurisdiction over our public
 
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
College systems it's it's strictly uh
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
the private colleges and um how it works
 
01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
is if if the ABC private college has um
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
baloria level approval from their
 
01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:00.830 align:start position:0%
baloria level approval from their
Regional

01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
Regional
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
accreditor they may add new
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
programs at any time if those new
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
programs are outside of their mission
 
01:48:09.790 --> 01:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
let's say they are a liberal arts
 
01:48:12.030 --> 01:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
college and they are starting their
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
first four-year nursing program they
 
01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
would seek what we call an
 
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
administrative review from the
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
commission and we would review that
 
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
program and present the findings to the
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
commission for approval further further
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
question yes um would you believe that
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
when we visited the school that was
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
going to add a master's degree
 
01:48:35.229 --> 01:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
in uh child education we found that that
 
01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
they were going to do it by starting a
 
01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
daycare center and they were declined
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
and and my would you believe it's
 
01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
important that this
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
commission be be staffed fully and
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
skillfully with people know what they're
 
01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
doing that's probably a rhetorical
 
01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:55.390 align:start position:0%
doing that's probably a rhetorical
question

01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
yes further
 
01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative pison
 
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
represent Damon so I'm I'm just trying
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
to clarify where we are I'm not um so
 
01:49:07.589 --> 01:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
there are two
 
01:49:09.550 --> 01:49:09.560 align:start position:0%
vacancies that have been well they're
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
not vacant there are two seats that
 
01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
nobody has put their um sat in in for
 
01:49:20.109 --> 01:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
months are those positions that were
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor did you say
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
that so the the non-statutory positions
 
01:49:28.950 --> 01:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
that those buckets of four and six are
 
01:49:30.589 --> 01:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
are nominated by the governor and
 
01:49:31.950 --> 01:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
appointed by the
 
01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:34.870 align:start position:0%
appointed by the
council

01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
council
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
question my followup the the I'm asking
 
01:49:42.189 --> 01:49:42.199 align:start position:0%
which ones are the uh situation where
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
they're not showing up yes we have um
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
one um former College president and one
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
um licensed Career School representative
 
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
and those just those are those are not
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor those they
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
both are they both yes private college
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
presidents are appointed by the
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
executive counsil and nominated by the
 
01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
governor and so what is the reason that
 
01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
they're not they're just saying because
 
01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:12.030 align:start position:0%
they're not they're just saying because
they're

01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
not I I'm not buying
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
that so so just my what I'm trying to
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
figure out is that there are the
 
01:50:23.709 --> 01:50:23.719 align:start position:0%
governor appoints many many people to
 
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
many many commissions so I don't
 
01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
understand if how this situation relates
 
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
to a fix here if the go if the question
 
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
is whether or not the governor can fill
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
a um assume that a person has resigned
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
because they haven't shown up then that
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
would not be dealt with here that would
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
be dealt somewhere with in the statutes
 
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
related to what the governor and councel
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
sense okay I thought he was gonna there
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
was a question here and I on her yeah I
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
I was he was you asked a question and I
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
was going to have him respond to your
 
01:51:13.950 --> 01:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
question I I think I can answer your
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
question yeah if that's okay yeah okay
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
so and I I'll grant you that the way
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
this statute is written as I was trying
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
to explain is not as thorough as it
 
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
could be but as I read the statute
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
currently a position never opens up if
 
01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
the member does not resign because after
 
01:51:39.629 --> 01:51:39.639 align:start position:0%
five years they can hang they can hang
 
01:51:39.639 --> 01:51:41.030 align:start position:0%
five years they can hang they can hang
in

01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
there because the position is still is
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
still nobody's been reappointed but but
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
if we change the rule way the law the
 
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
way they are asking us to
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
then after 5 years they are
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
automatically resigned as I read it and
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
at that point the position opens up and
 
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
the governor could could to replace them
 
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
but these two positions these two people
 
01:52:05.709 --> 01:52:05.719 align:start position:0%
he's talking about currently apparently
 
01:52:07.149 --> 01:52:07.159 align:start position:0%
their five years is up I can't I don't
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
know that or not but this is with okay
 
01:52:12.669 --> 01:52:12.679 align:start position:0%
well when the five years is up so
 
01:52:14.430 --> 01:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
whenever that happens sometime down the
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
road the governor would be able to
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
reappoint them but currently couldn't as
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
I was suggesting more along the lines of
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about in fact we
 
01:52:25.069 --> 01:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
should and also represent spillsbury we
 
01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
probably should be a little tighter than
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
that even and if you don't show up for
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
some number of meetings or whatever in
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
addition to this whole thing um just so
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't want to get too much in
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
this executive session type discussion I
 
01:52:40.109 --> 01:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
know but uh we need to filter through
 
01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
this a little bit of here um one more
 
01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
and then I'll go to D just I'm just
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
wondering if represent um Earth sees
 
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
agrees that it's a issue that would
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
apply to more than just this one
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
commission I I think what we ought to do
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
is before answering that question by
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
anybody right here we're getting into
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
that next
 
01:53:06.109 --> 01:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
portion and and and if you want to go
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
that way with your question that's
 
01:53:12.030 --> 01:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
fine because he could help you out with
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
the a response here oh okay represent
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I have two
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
things if I may
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
so the first I guess I'm looking for a
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
confirmation that our discussion is
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
indicating there's two problems to
 
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
solve so one is the you're at the end of
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
your five-year term and the language
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
does not clearly say that you're done
 
01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
and someone can either you can be
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
reappointed or someone else can be
 
01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
appointed so that seems like a fairly
 
01:53:50.109 --> 01:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
straight forward uh address and then the
 
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
other is this issue of the mid midterm
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
participation so is that correct that we
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
really need two
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
solutions I thank you potentially yes so
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay and then if I may one more yes
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so in the statute um let me
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
get the right part here
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
sorry where it
 
01:54:17.709 --> 01:54:17.719 align:start position:0%
references um the members appointed by
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
the governor and councel etc
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
etc um
 
01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
so it says six representatives of the
 
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
private four-year colleges in New
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire appointed by the governor and
 
01:54:30.189 --> 01:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
Council on recommendation and the
 
01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
limitation of no more than one rep from
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
any one college I don't read that to say
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
that those Representatives have to be in
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they have to
 
01:54:43.229 --> 01:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
represent private fouryear colleges in
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but they don't have to be
 
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
here seemed like there was discussion
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
that suggested they did have to be New
 
01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:49.470 align:start position:0%
that suggested they did have to be New
Hampshire

01:54:49.470 --> 01:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
residents I think by practice that's
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
been the case so we could certainly if
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
we're fixing language elsewhere we could
 
01:54:57.069 --> 01:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
certainly add that in as
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
well that was my initial comment yeah
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
one college
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so do we
 
01:55:08.109 --> 01:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
want so if I were serving
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
on in that role and I relocated out of
 
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
state I'm not sure that necessarily
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
diminishes the person's capacity to
 
01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
serve so I don't know what you want
 
01:55:24.990 --> 01:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
there but I guess that needs some
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
clarification I think the wording would
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
speak to it being a New Hampshire
 
01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:31.870 align:start position:0%
speak to it being a New Hampshire
approved

01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:33.870 --> 01:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
institution but not necessarily a

funding committee for the record my name
 
02:00:40.069 --> 02:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
is Rick lad I come from hail New
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh representing Grafton
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
5 uh today I'm introducing this bill uh
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
which requires the State Board of
 
02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
Education to report the unfunded
 
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
Financial impact to school districts for
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
rules adopted by the board which exceed
 
02:01:01.229 --> 02:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
standards for years we've been trying to
 
02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
cut back in some of the rules that the
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislature always attaches to some Bill
 
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the when we put F uh the
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
the reference to rule making in in the
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
bill it's very Broad and very it doesn't
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
speak to a specific area where the
 
02:01:26.350 --> 02:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
legislature is supposed to make rule
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
making I think that my Approach is that
 
02:01:34.069 --> 02:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
we have to talk about this term of
 
02:01:37.109 --> 02:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
deregulation stopping all the rules to
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
allow people to function and know what's
 
02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
coming at them that may exceed law and
 
02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
within law I've handed out a sheet to
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
you which looks at 186 C co 16- uh C and
 
02:01:57.390 --> 02:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
that's rules exceeding state or federal
 
02:01:59.950 --> 02:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements so we have given
 
02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
authority to the Department of Education
 
02:02:06.109 --> 02:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
to extend rules that
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
exceed our laws or fate or state federal
 
02:02:15.189 --> 02:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
laws and on the backside of the first
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
sheet there's an area on 186c which I
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
took out a statute which gives the rule
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
making Authority
 
02:02:24.510 --> 02:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
when you're sticking in the terminology
 
02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:25.669 align:start position:0%
when you're sticking in the terminology
RSC

02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
RSC
 
02:02:28.270 --> 02:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
541a that's meaning you're going to do
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
make rules in accordance with what we
 
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
have in statute it's going to have to be
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
looked at by gel car and there those
 
02:02:36.669 --> 02:02:36.679 align:start position:0%
rules are going to have to be approved
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
by the State Board of
 
02:02:40.510 --> 02:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
Education item number eight underneath
 
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:42.679 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authorities other matters
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
relating to complying with provisions of
 
02:02:47.709 --> 02:02:47.719 align:start position:0%
this chapter it's very broad it's very
 
02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
broad that means that they're pretty
 
02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
much given a blank check
 
02:02:55.709 --> 02:02:55.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of what they can make rules
 
02:02:58.830 --> 02:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
for we do have within statute on the
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
first side there on the first sheet
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
where we say for each rule or proposed
 
02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
rule contained in the report there's a
 
02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
report which is due annually to the to
 
02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:11.229 align:start position:0%
report which is due annually to the to
to

02:03:11.229 --> 02:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:03:14.189 --> 02:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
us and it's spelled out by December one
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
of each year the commissioner Department
 
02:03:17.069 --> 02:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
of Education shall issue a report for
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
all special education rules proposed or
 
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
adopted which exceed the minimum
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
standards etc etc
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
um for each rule or proposed rule
 
02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
contained in the report the State Board
 
02:03:30.270 --> 02:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
shall include one the rule
 
02:03:34.189 --> 02:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
number two the nature of the rule three
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
any state minimum requirement
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
exceeded any federal minimum requirement
 
02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
exceeded and jumping over number five
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
there the reasons for exceeding those
 
02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements those are in law
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
right now the report has to contain that
 
02:03:55.390 --> 02:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the the last sheet I
 
02:03:57.629 --> 02:03:57.639 align:start position:0%
have for you and I'm going to go back
 
02:03:59.470 --> 02:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
and talk about number five here in a
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
second but there is a form which is the
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
devel the state board has
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
developed uh New Hampshire standards in
 
02:04:12.669 --> 02:04:12.679 align:start position:0%
excess chart and the chart below it's
 
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
it's one of 17
 
02:04:18.750 --> 02:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
Pages which stipulates the standards the
 
02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:20.709 align:start position:0%
Pages which stipulates the standards the
rules

02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:04:24.549 --> 02:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
ed102 01f and it goes right down all
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
those rules I only gave page one of 17
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
to you I wanted you to know that there
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
is a format which they have to report to
 
02:04:35.950 --> 02:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
us annually on those rules which exceed
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
and the nature of the standard and that
 
02:04:40.589 --> 02:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
tells you just broadly well this is for
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
adult students okay State minimum
 
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
requirement exceeded yes it that
 
02:04:47.629 --> 02:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
particular ed1
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
102.0 does exceed there is no comparable
 
02:04:53.470 --> 02:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
language in RSA
 
02:04:56.830 --> 02:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
186c there's rationale for why they do
 
02:04:59.310 --> 02:04:59.320 align:start position:0%
have to exceed I understand that I'm not
 
02:05:00.669 --> 02:05:00.679 align:start position:0%
objecting to
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
that federal minimum requirement
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
exceeded in this particular case on Ed
 
02:05:08.589 --> 02:05:08.599 align:start position:0%
yes there is no comparable Federal
 
02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
language for uh emancipated
 
02:05:15.149 --> 02:05:15.159 align:start position:0%
minor going on language in the standard
 
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
so it list the standard and reason for
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
exceeding that standard this is
 
02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
information which is submitted publicly
 
02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:25.669 align:start position:0%
information which is submitted publicly
and

02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:29.069 --> 02:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
available what I've heard from a number
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
of folks in the field over my years of
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
being here that when we adopt these
 
02:05:39.229 --> 02:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
rules what is the corresponding cost to
 
02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
implement this Rule and by doing so are
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
we going Beyond what's being funded to
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
us through adequacy or through
 
02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:51.679 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid or whatever it may be
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
within the education statutes the
 
02:05:53.599 --> 02:05:55.750 align:start position:0%
within the education statutes the
annotated

02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
annotated
 
02:06:00.109 --> 02:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
statutes and it it does uh because we
 
02:06:03.790 --> 02:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
have this broad other rules you know as
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
as stated right there on the on the rul
 
02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
making side other matters related to
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
complying with provisions of this
 
02:06:12.109 --> 02:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
chapter it's pretty wide open game and
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
so I'm introducing this bill because I'd
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
like to see in the in the legislation
 
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
the unfunded Financial impact on local
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
school DS for Rural on districts for
 
02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
rules exceeding state or federal minimum
 
02:06:26.549 --> 02:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
requirements I'm not saying you
 
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do it I'm saying what are the
 
02:06:30.430 --> 02:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
costs to doing
 
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
this and you know and speaking just a
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
second ago with our our chair of the of
 
02:06:39.229 --> 02:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
the State Board I understand where Mr
 
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
kin's coming from that's going to be an
 
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
expense or a cost to putting this all
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
together I get it I understand that but
 
02:06:49.629 --> 02:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the way we have to
 
02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
realize that the more rues we make the
 
02:06:55.990 --> 02:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
more cumbersome it is to do our business
 
02:06:57.149 --> 02:06:57.159 align:start position:0%
especially when we're seeing the
 
02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679 align:start position:0%
demographic in the state declining the
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
funding situations which we're
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
encountering we need to be cautious on
 
02:07:07.629 --> 02:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and we need to know
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
what's going on with some of these rules
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
and for me I got to know the fiscal
 
02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
impacts you know the rule number I know
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
the rule number I know you know all the
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
other stuff that's listed there and I
 
02:07:20.109 --> 02:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
can read the rational up top of why they
 
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
have to exceed
 
02:07:24.990 --> 02:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
so that's it in a nutshell of what we're
 
02:07:26.830 --> 02:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do this bill is trying to do
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
not we I am trying to do and I'm I'm
 
02:07:32.109 --> 02:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
open to any
 
02:07:35.870 --> 02:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh yes
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative bricky thank you thank
 
02:07:41.310 --> 02:07:41.320 align:start position:0%
you um and thank you representative lad
 
02:07:43.709 --> 02:07:43.719 align:start position:0%
for answering my question so do you
 
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
envision like one
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
more column on this chart that has money
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
and if there's yes if there is an
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
adopted rule or a rule that's in place
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
and it's causing that local school board
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
this type of
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
cost and it may be a justifiable cost oh
 
02:08:06.350 --> 02:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
yeah but I I think that we need to know
 
02:08:08.589 --> 02:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
that in order to make the decisions
 
02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
which we're making to be a little bit
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
more cautious sometimes when we're
 
02:08:11.719 --> 02:08:12.549 align:start position:0%
more cautious sometimes when we're
making

02:08:12.549 --> 02:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
making
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
rules or approving them through Jael
 
02:08:19.149 --> 02:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
card I know that as chair of this body
 
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
and chair of the education committee
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
last year we were asked to review every
 
02:08:27.069 --> 02:08:27.079 align:start position:0%
new rule that's being proposed or being
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
renewed every 10 years the committee has
 
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
that task and to communicate then with
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
the chair of Jael
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
car somebody that represent McGuire
 
02:08:38.910 --> 02:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
knows very very
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
well uh to inform them of the impacts
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
that that may
 
02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
have you're welcome representative pep
 
02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
Miller thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
you chairman lad for
 
02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill I completely agree
 
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
with the spirit of it my one concern is
 
02:08:59.229 --> 02:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
about the use of the word unfunded
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
instead of say additional Financial
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
impact because I'm trying to understand
 
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
whether that put a burden on the State
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
Board of Education to judge what is
 
02:09:12.910 --> 02:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
unfunded and what is not while if we
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
simply said additional Financial impact
 
02:09:18.109 --> 02:09:18.119 align:start position:0%
that would remove the the need for them
 
02:09:20.669 --> 02:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
to make determination which is really a
 
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislative determination and would
 
02:09:24.669 --> 02:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
still provide us with the information
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we need in terms of the financial
 
02:09:28.750 --> 02:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
impact of the rules that exceed the
 
02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
minimum standards I I what you're saying
 
02:09:34.549 --> 02:09:34.559 align:start position:0%
to me is logical and maybe we have to
 
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
look at that you just use the term the
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
financial impact you took the unfunded
 
02:09:43.069 --> 02:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
out of it uh so you know the financial
 
02:09:45.149 --> 02:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
impact is what we want to know how is
 
02:09:48.430 --> 02:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
this impacting that District that really
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the resources to comply y
 
02:09:51.119 --> 02:09:51.830 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the resources to comply y
thank

02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman so would
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
you believe that uh representative Carol
 
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
McGuire is no longer the chair or vice
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
chair of Jael car and uh she's she's
 
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
sort of winding down and handed the
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
house leadership position to
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative Lon all right so um let
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
me ask
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is this something that um the board
 
02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
when they make such a rule can answer
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
right I mean is this a number that they
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
can always come up with are they like
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
have the capability of the LBA or
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
something that they can write a fiscal
 
02:10:34.149 --> 02:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
note sort of like
 
02:10:38.109 --> 02:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
this that might be a a question
 
02:10:40.830 --> 02:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
you if Drew is going to be coming up
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
here I I would May pose that to him you
 
02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
know we a lot of this you're estimating
 
02:10:47.790 --> 02:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
the cost too you don't you don't they're
 
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
indeterminable in many ways but uh it
 
02:10:53.470 --> 02:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
helpful if we we knew that and if
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
districts know that as well and yeah I
 
02:11:00.030 --> 02:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
do apologize I re I know repr McGuire is
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
not there anymore I was on it with her
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
and she lasted a long time and I got off
 
02:11:08.910 --> 02:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:12.430 --> 02:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
could representative Damon thank you Mr
 
02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
which you may defer to Mr Klein based on
 
02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
your response to representative Maguire
 
02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:22.470 align:start position:0%
your response to representative Maguire
but

02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:11:25.390 --> 02:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
I'm puzzling a bit
 
02:11:27.669 --> 02:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
over what I would perceive as a
 
02:11:30.589 --> 02:11:30.599 align:start position:0%
difference in financial impact of say
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
any particular rule isn't going to have
 
02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
the same Financial impact to every
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
school district so is this proposed Bill
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
looking for a summary number of the
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
financial impact of a rule to all the
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
districts or something different from
 
02:11:52.189 --> 02:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
that I have haven't given it that type
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
of thought you know I was looking on
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
average or but to say the financial
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
impact of a b c d going on down through
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
all those districts I think that'd be a
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
very difficult job Senor talking about
 
02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
Manchester with 13 plus thousand kids
 
02:12:09.390 --> 02:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
and then or so and then you're talking
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
about cuden and those that area yours
 
02:12:17.790 --> 02:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
you know 100 kids I roughly two okay so
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
the impacts are going to be different
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
but proportionally there's still an
 
02:12:20.639 --> 02:12:22.709 align:start position:0%
but proportionally there's still an
impact

02:12:22.709 --> 02:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:12:24.189 --> 02:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
because your revenues are not the same
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
of what the other larger district
 
02:12:31.950 --> 02:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
has yes F so thank you for that that's
 
02:12:33.669 --> 02:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
why I asked the question that it would
 
02:12:35.790 --> 02:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
be considerably different impact in
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
different districts and I'm not
 
02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
clear whether the cost of a particular
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
rule would be the same per student so
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not disagreeing about the
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
need to look at the fiscal impact of the
 
02:12:50.910 --> 02:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
rules that we make I'm just trying to
 
02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:53.390 align:start position:0%
rules that we make I'm just trying to
understand

02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.430 --> 02:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
and how this bill would be this proposed
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
bill would be implemented uh in a
 
02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
practical and not
 
02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:03.629 align:start position:0%
practical and not
overly

02:13:03.629 --> 02:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
overly
 
02:13:07.350 --> 02:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
um costly way like the cost of of
 
02:13:08.549 --> 02:13:08.559 align:start position:0%
collecting the
 
02:13:12.549 --> 02:13:12.559 align:start position:0%
data I'm not sure that's a question
 
02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm asking for your
 
02:13:18.189 --> 02:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
comment I don't have a specific answer
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
to that question uh it's there there's
 
02:13:22.750 --> 02:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
going to be some rules that don't even
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
apply to certain
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
districts um other districts are going
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
to get hammered um and in and and some
 
02:13:34.549 --> 02:13:34.559 align:start position:0%
some and I agree many of our rules we
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
have to go a little bit further because
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's not really defined well within the
 
02:13:41.709 --> 02:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
state or federal law and it leaves a
 
02:13:43.549 --> 02:13:43.559 align:start position:0%
hole and that's what it basically says
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
in the top part on the on the small
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
print that's necessary um if we're going
 
02:13:52.109 --> 02:13:52.119 align:start position:0%
to travel that we're and we're the one
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
passing it anyways with the it's coming
 
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
from the legislature so we do discuss
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
that uh I am primarily concerned about
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
the cost to these districts that certain
 
02:14:06.549 --> 02:14:06.559 align:start position:0%
rules have that costs are not met
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
through the revenue picture which
 
02:14:13.229 --> 02:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.430 --> 02:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
state okay representative
 
02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:18.229 align:start position:0%
state okay representative
Ames

02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah interesting proposal uh
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if the uh history we have
 
02:14:28.109 --> 02:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
experience we have with fiscal notes
 
02:14:28.119 --> 02:14:29.430 align:start position:0%
experience we have with fiscal notes
might

02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
might
 
02:14:34.549 --> 02:14:34.559 align:start position:0%
inform uh how best to approach this new
 
02:14:34.559 --> 02:14:36.069 align:start position:0%
inform uh how best to approach this new
requirement

02:14:36.069 --> 02:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:14:39.229 --> 02:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
um you know we we see in fiscal notes
 
02:14:41.549 --> 02:14:41.559 align:start position:0%
often the word
 
02:14:45.149 --> 02:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
indeterminable and um that sort of is an
 
02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
escape clause for the agencies that just
 
02:14:52.109 --> 02:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
can't really figure it out because there
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
are too many uncertainties out there and
 
02:14:57.390 --> 02:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
there's no softening of this requirement
 
02:14:59.069 --> 02:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
it's thought there might be a financial
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
impact while by goly you got to figure
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
it out um you know so I'm I'm suggesting
 
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
and asking if you think we might uh
 
02:15:12.669 --> 02:15:12.679 align:start position:0%
pause and look at other experiences that
 
02:15:15.149 --> 02:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
would help us help everybody understand
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
what's now being required of this agency
 
02:15:21.629 --> 02:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
rep Ames I agree with you
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
that there is no fiscal note on this
 
02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
right here in this
 
02:15:28.990 --> 02:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill um it has a March 20 deadline it's
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
not an early bill it can be retained
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's one of those types of bills the
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
concept why or principle wise there
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
there's some rationale for it but
 
02:15:45.149 --> 02:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
there's unended cost here maybe that you
 
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
know the depart or a costs which the
 
02:15:49.950 --> 02:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
department is going to have to incur to
 
02:15:52.709 --> 02:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
do this and can we acquire how it
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
impacts as representative Damon says one
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
District versus another District um it
 
02:15:59.830 --> 02:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
it does need work in that but I think
 
02:16:02.189 --> 02:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
it's something which we need to look at
 
02:16:07.069 --> 02:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
and and and address uh is one of those
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
and and I I know that it's been put out
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
to legislators that we really encourage
 
02:16:17.549 --> 02:16:17.559 align:start position:0%
you everybody to slow down on the ru
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
making for all these and if you have to
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
have Ru making do it specifically to one
 
02:16:24.910 --> 02:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
particular element within the
 
02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
legislation don't get broad General
 
02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
rulemaking uh too many unended
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
consequences as a result of that um we
 
02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:34.559 align:start position:0%
ask for those other five
 
02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
components why we're exceeding the state
 
02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
why we're exceeding the minimum what is
 
02:16:41.709 --> 02:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
the standard and I think there's also
 
02:16:43.950 --> 02:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
the we need to have a little bit better
 
02:16:46.270 --> 02:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
understanding what are the costs
 
02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:47.750 align:start position:0%
understanding what are the costs
associated

02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
associated
 
02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
costs and representative ases and can I
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
can I ask you together with uh
 
02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative lad I think
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative lad was interpreting your
 
02:17:00.509 --> 02:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
question is whether there should be a
 
02:17:03.709 --> 02:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal note to this bill but I wasn't
 
02:17:05.790 --> 02:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
your question whether the model of a
 
02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note would lend itself well to
 
02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
this and be used in the rul making
 
02:17:16.349 --> 02:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
process so yes that's something that I I
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
like that track yes I thought it was an
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
excellent question I wanted to make sure
 
02:17:24.270 --> 02:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
we hit it um it's an interesting concept
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
whether that might be a little bit more
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
of a flexible approach than uh a hard
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
number in a chart representative fellows
 
02:17:34.509 --> 02:17:34.519 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'm I'm quite quite sure
 
02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
that when rules are proposed there's a
 
02:17:39.309 --> 02:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
question on the rules form that
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
addresses is this going to have a
 
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
financial impact and on whom and that's
 
02:17:47.549 --> 02:17:47.559 align:start position:0%
kind of like a you might think of it as
 
02:17:50.349 --> 02:17:50.359 align:start position:0%
being kind of like a fiscal note but I
 
02:17:53.389 --> 02:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
think the way the language is in here
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's not that necessarily the department
 
02:17:59.190 --> 02:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
would have to say you know it's going to
 
02:18:00.669 --> 02:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
cost you know
 
02:18:03.910 --> 02:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
$2.2 million or whatever across the
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
state it can be more like a fiscal more
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
like a statement that says you know if
 
02:18:13.549 --> 02:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
you're changing the age of of when um
 
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
the special ed students can remain from
 
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
20 to through 21 than just saying
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
something like that means that you know
 
02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
about X number of students for every
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
student that stays an extra year is
 
02:18:31.110 --> 02:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
going to have a cost for the district
 
02:18:33.070 --> 02:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
even if you don't put an exact number on
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
it that's an important piece of
 
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
information I agree with that we we went
 
02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
through that business up to age 20 22
 
02:18:45.549 --> 02:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
other words through 21 and there were
 
02:18:48.870 --> 02:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
there are real implications in terms of
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
finances on that especially when we
 
02:18:53.070 --> 02:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
start start talking about the special
 
02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
education Aid um we we did discuss that
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
when we passed up to age
 
02:19:01.870 --> 02:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
21 um but you're on the right track
 
02:19:03.790 --> 02:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
there and I I think that
 
02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
this I I don't think this is ready yet
 
02:19:09.429 --> 02:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
but the concept I'm trying to propose is
 
02:19:12.509 --> 02:19:12.519 align:start position:0%
that we need to be doing something so uh
 
02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
when uh Jael cars and trying to figure
 
02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
out what this is all about they have
 
02:19:19.870 --> 02:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
some better fiscal understanding some of
 
02:19:22.230 --> 02:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
these bills that come through are very
 
02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
innocuous and I can remember one I put
 
02:19:26.750 --> 02:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
through that was Capital Improvements
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
for Statewide fairs the ru making
 
02:19:35.469 --> 02:19:35.479 align:start position:0%
process took over two years for
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
$250,000 and and it
 
02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
so that whole process needs a little bit
 
02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:42.190 align:start position:0%
so that whole process needs a little bit
of

02:19:42.190 --> 02:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
thought I have a question um and and I I
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
agree I think this can be worked um but
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
when we use adjectives like unfunded to
 
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
modify Financial impact or exceeding uh
 
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
minimum standards it it makes me wonder
 
02:20:03.469 --> 02:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
whether the rule making Authority in the
 
02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
first instance was tightly enough drawn
 
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
right so for example in uh 186 c16 which
 
02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
you handed out subparagraph 8 that that
 
02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh loose last phrase other matters
 
02:20:20.270 --> 02:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
related to related to is a very loose
 
02:20:22.910 --> 02:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
phrase yeah you know why wouldn't that
 
02:20:26.590 --> 02:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
be better rephrased as other matters
 
02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
required to comply and then you get
 
02:20:33.070 --> 02:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
right back to your language in this bill
 
02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
which is requirements why are we
 
02:20:38.110 --> 02:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
exceeding requirements in the first
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
place yes and that yeah that the last
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
part of the first part there the the
 
02:20:45.469 --> 02:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
rule make other matters that sounds like
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
lawyer talk to me it's you know we use
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
terms like reasonable well you try to
 
02:20:53.309 --> 02:20:53.319 align:start position:0%
Define reasonable sometimes you know uh
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
I see it coming through it all the time
 
02:20:59.710 --> 02:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
and so you know given that clock here I
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
think what we ought to do is conclude my
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
testimony here move
 
02:21:10.990 --> 02:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
question oh represent Damon sorry not
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
turning thank you
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
kindly is this is this for this would
 
02:21:21.550 --> 02:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
you please comment on the
 
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
possible perhaps unintended consequence
 
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
of doing this
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
work on the likelihood of having
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
less statutes that exceed or rules that
 
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
standards you're going to have some
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
statutes that require you to have new
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
labor within your building but under the
 
02:21:53.550 --> 02:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
guys of special Eden we can pass that
 
02:21:55.309 --> 02:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
type of legislation but we don't have to
 
02:21:57.630 --> 02:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
pass the dollars to support
 
02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
it to me that's going to be the impact
 
02:22:02.469 --> 02:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
it's going to be the impact to the
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
district trying to figure out where
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to take it and they're
 
02:22:06.910 --> 02:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
going to be taking it from Peter to pay
 
02:22:09.309 --> 02:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
paal so I don't know if that answers
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from on that
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh the this is an issue which as is
 
02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
age-old issue that needs I think
 
02:22:22.349 --> 02:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
consideration and where we have a
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
special committee here to do that right
 
02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
now I thought it might be one that we
 
02:22:30.429 --> 02:22:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
into yes represent fellas thank you and
 
02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you had been on
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
you you you've been on Edna and where I
 
02:22:41.830 --> 02:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
was served also and I'm currently on
 
02:22:46.030 --> 02:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
Jael car so don't you do you think that
 
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
this is also important information for
 
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
Jael car because
 
02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
your proposal is that the uh legislature
 
02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
here sees it first before this is
 
02:23:01.349 --> 02:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to be prepared before Jael car
 
02:23:03.389 --> 02:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
has to make a decision on new rules is
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
that correct well I've never been on Eda
 
02:23:10.110 --> 02:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
Edna I thought but I was on Jael car and
 
02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
and and uh many of us have been on Jael
 
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
car uh that's the last step and and and
 
02:23:19.630 --> 02:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
and then you you know can do things
 
02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
conditionally what Happ you uh then it
 
02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
goes back to the the bureau or the
 
02:23:25.469 --> 02:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
department or the board that's coming
 
02:23:28.990 --> 02:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
from and they ultimately make the final
 
02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:32.710 align:start position:0%
from and they ultimately make the final
decision

02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:35.110 --> 02:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
so okay well that was quite a round of
 
02:23:37.150 --> 02:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:51.070 --> 02:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
speak so Drew Klein chairman of the
 
02:23:53.309 --> 02:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education right um thank
 
02:23:54.870 --> 02:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for the record Drew
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
Klein chairman of the State Board of
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
Education I didn't fill out a pink slip
 
02:23:58.950 --> 02:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
I just come to observe but I think it
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
would be useful uh to sort of get some
 
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
perspective here um and maybe answer
 
02:24:04.750 --> 02:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
questions so I agree with representative
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
lad entirely on the premise um I can
 
02:24:09.550 --> 02:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
tell you at the State Board of Education
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
we work very hard not to exceed any of
 
02:24:13.630 --> 02:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
our statutory Authority uh I have
 
02:24:15.150 --> 02:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
instructed all of our attorneys whenever
 
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
we have every single rule that comes
 
02:24:19.710 --> 02:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
before us to make sure that it aligns
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
with the statutory Authority whether
 
02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's Federal statutes um State
 
02:24:26.349 --> 02:24:26.359 align:start position:0%
statutes or uh Federal Regulations you
 
02:24:28.230 --> 02:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
look through the 1100s which are special
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
education rules and you will see
 
02:24:34.630 --> 02:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
constant references to cfrs the Federal
 
02:24:37.230 --> 02:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
Regulations um you know every rule we
 
02:24:40.429 --> 02:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
write we make a point of spelling out
 
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
where we get the authority to do it and
 
02:24:44.030 --> 02:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
what the parameters of that Authority is
 
02:24:47.469 --> 02:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
so we try to stay within that
 
02:24:51.429 --> 02:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
um what we don't do is the financial
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
impact analysis we're just not equipped
 
02:24:58.349 --> 02:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
to do that but um it's a fair question
 
02:25:01.150 --> 02:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
so whenever we take on revising our
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
rules um this particular board is always
 
02:25:07.710 --> 02:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
looking at them and
 
02:25:10.030 --> 02:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
questioning why do we have this mandate
 
02:25:11.910 --> 02:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
on school districts what do it
 
02:25:14.950 --> 02:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
accomplished can we accomplish it in a
 
02:25:19.389 --> 02:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
less mandatory way um and are there are
 
02:25:22.030 --> 02:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
there costs to this mandate now we
 
02:25:23.870 --> 02:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
understand that we can't impose unfunded
 
02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:24.830 align:start position:0%
understand that we can't impose unfunded
costs

02:25:24.830 --> 02:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
but the nature of rulemaking is to
 
02:25:30.030 --> 02:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
require that districts do certain things
 
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
so we're always looking for ways where
 
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
we can reduce that burden on districts
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
but we don't have the capability to do
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have a statistician on staff we
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
don't have an economist we don't have a
 
02:25:42.910 --> 02:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
an an analyst to do that Financial
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
impact um assessment so my question uh
 
02:25:50.429 --> 02:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
on this would be if you want to go
 
02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
forward I have no objection to us
 
02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
looking at how our rules impact
 
02:25:57.670 --> 02:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
districts financially it's a totally
 
02:25:59.550 --> 02:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
fair thing for us to look at I just
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
don't know how we're going to execute
 
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
this Faithfully with the intent of the
 
02:26:08.429 --> 02:26:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:11.790 --> 02:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
statute very good
 
02:26:15.269 --> 02:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
questions is there as opposed to a
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
financial analysis that expects a
 
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
quantifiable finite figure
 
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
um is there is there a process for
 
02:26:26.349 --> 02:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
regulatory impact already is that what
 
02:26:28.349 --> 02:26:28.359 align:start position:0%
this chart we seeing
 
02:26:31.870 --> 02:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
is not regulatory just speaking more
 
02:26:34.110 --> 02:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
broadly in terms of impact I mean not
 
02:26:36.510 --> 02:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
not in the sense of um a sheet that
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
comes up with an analysis um our our
 
02:26:41.469 --> 02:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
sort of method of doing this is in the
 
02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
ru making process from start to finish
 
02:26:45.309 --> 02:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
we have the Professional Standards Board
 
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
we have folks who um get stakeholders
 
02:26:50.830 --> 02:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
together talk about about what the rules
 
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
should be um so we're on a 10-year
 
02:26:55.230 --> 02:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
conveyor belt all the rules have to be
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
renewed every 10 years and so when they
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
come up or when we propose a new rule it
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
goes through a pretty long process
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
before it even gets to um us for the
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
initial proposal by trying to get
 
02:27:11.790 --> 02:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input um and so in the
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
process then we have public hearings and
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
we we hear from districts so that's
 
02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
really the process where we try to get
 
02:27:21.070 --> 02:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
that feedback on okay
 
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
what's the impact will you guys be able
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
to execute this is it going to be
 
02:27:26.110 --> 02:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
burdensome that kind of
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
thing so it's not it's not really a
 
02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:30.030 align:start position:0%
thing so it's not it's not really a
mathematical

02:27:30.030 --> 02:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
mathematical
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
formula further questions good thank you
 
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
I think oh yes Damon thank you thank you
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question it's actually the
 
02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
same question that I asked
 
02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative lad I would appreciate
 
02:27:45.870 --> 02:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
your comments on the
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
possibility of unintended consequences
 
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
from doing this meaning that
 
02:27:54.990 --> 02:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
we did not maintain the same standards
 
02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
that we now
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
have that is the standards that are
 
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
currently exceeding
 
02:28:03.630 --> 02:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
minimum which I think we all agree there
 
02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:04.910 align:start position:0%
minimum which I think we all agree there
are

02:28:04.910 --> 02:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:28:07.710 --> 02:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
many does doing this fiscal accounting
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
if it were to
 
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
happen increase the likelihood that we
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
then have
 
02:28:16.269 --> 02:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
fewer F RS exceeding the minimum yeah I
 
02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
I would put it this
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
way when we we re when we again um take
 
02:28:25.950 --> 02:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
up rules to revise them um again I've
 
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
directed the attorneys to make sure that
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
the rules that we're proposing do align
 
02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
with statutory Authority I try not to
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
ever exceed the minimums if we don't
 
02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
have to if there's not so for example
 
02:28:41.309 --> 02:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
I'll show you in this that you've been
 
02:28:45.070 --> 02:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
given um the examples for exceeding the
 
02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
minimums typically where where we have
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
something that you could argue would
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
exceed the minimum it's because of a
 
02:28:53.670 --> 02:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
gray area it's because the federal rule
 
02:28:56.429 --> 02:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
or law or the statute just simply didn't
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
answer an important question and so
 
02:29:01.230 --> 02:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
we've got to make a decision over
 
02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
answering that question so that you
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
could say that exceeds the the minimum
 
02:29:09.469 --> 02:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
but um we've had cases where you know
 
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
over years where if we don't write a
 
02:29:14.670 --> 02:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
rule there then we have districts who
 
02:29:16.349 --> 02:29:16.359 align:start position:0%
have unanswered questions so they're
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
coming to the department saying what
 
02:29:20.349 --> 02:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
does this mean what am I allowed to do
 
02:29:22.349 --> 02:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
and if we don't have a rule that gives
 
02:29:24.510 --> 02:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
them guidance um they don't have that
 
02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:25.469 align:start position:0%
them guidance um they don't have that
guidance

02:29:25.469 --> 02:29:25.479 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
02:29:28.269 --> 02:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
so so we're always striving to keep them
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
as minimal as possible but there are
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
areas where you kind of have to go fill
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
in the blank so to speak um if we had a
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
financial impact statement I'm not sure
 
02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
that that would reduce those fill-in the
 
02:29:45.870 --> 02:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
blank moments um but it might tip the
 
02:29:48.389 --> 02:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
balance for example so if you had
 
02:29:50.550 --> 02:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
something that had if we
 
02:29:52.269 --> 02:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
did some rule that had a really big
 
02:29:54.150 --> 02:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
Financial impact we might go W I mean I
 
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
think our obvious response would be
 
02:29:59.790 --> 02:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
let's rethink this and not impose this
 
02:30:03.110 --> 02:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
cost on District so you would probably
 
02:30:06.349 --> 02:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
end up on the margins with fewer rules
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
um because you would have that Financial
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
trigger to give us the red flag that oh
 
02:30:12.269 --> 02:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
we didn't realize this was going to
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
impose such a cost but um when you're
 
02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
thinking about special education costs
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
if you just go through the 1100s you'll
 
02:30:21.469 --> 02:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
see how much they align to State
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
statutes and federal regulations the CFR
 
02:30:26.309 --> 02:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
is the constant reference in the special
 
02:30:30.190 --> 02:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
education rules um I would argue that
 
02:30:32.950 --> 02:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
without having done a a comprehensive
 
02:30:36.429 --> 02:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
study of it um the costs that get passed
 
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
districts implement the rules not a
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
specific mandate that we put on them
 
02:30:51.469 --> 02:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
that says you have to do X Y and Z so
 
02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
um would would this bill actually see a
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
big reduction in special education costs
 
02:30:59.439 --> 02:31:02.309 align:start position:0%
big reduction in special education costs
probably

02:31:02.309 --> 02:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:02.319 --> 02:31:04.030 align:start position:0%
 
not

02:31:04.030 --> 02:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:31:07.550 --> 02:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
yeah okay any further questions very
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
good thank
 
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
you uh I have one pink card from Bonnie
 
02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:29.550 align:start position:0%
you uh I have one pink card from Bonnie
dham

02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you bon hi I'm Bonnie Dunham and I
 
02:31:35.150 --> 02:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
live in marac New Hampshire and I am
 
02:31:39.670 --> 02:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to this bill um
 
02:31:42.269 --> 02:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to this bill I left my
 
02:31:44.349 --> 02:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
son at home this morning after spending
 
02:31:46.110 --> 02:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
3 days in the hospital with him and
 
02:31:48.590 --> 02:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
getting 10 hours sleep in 3 days I came
 
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
here because this is real important to
 
02:31:52.910 --> 02:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
the lives of children with disabilities
 
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
that that we re that we consider this
 
02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
bill very very carefully um first I'm
 
02:32:00.590 --> 02:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
kind of offended because the in the
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
description it says talks about unfunded
 
02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
Financial impact for rules for Education
 
02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
rules why is this amending a special
 
02:32:10.110 --> 02:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
education law then is it really just
 
02:32:12.510 --> 02:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
targeting special education costs or
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
costs for all education roles um it
 
02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
seems like special education is often
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
scapegoated as as costing so much um and
 
02:32:24.550 --> 02:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
it does cost something I'm not going to
 
02:32:26.990 --> 02:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
deny that um when I was thinking about
 
02:32:30.429 --> 02:32:30.439 align:start position:0%
this I was thinking about when um Ida
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
was first passed does people refer to
 
02:32:35.150 --> 02:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
that as an unfunded mandate in many ways
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
and does it cost something yes but
 
02:32:40.830 --> 02:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
before we had that special education law
 
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities um were not
 
02:32:44.590 --> 02:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to go to school so they either
 
02:32:46.429 --> 02:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
stayed home and didn't go to school or
 
02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
they were institutionalized and and
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
didn't go to school and in the best case
 
02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
they spent their adult lives doomed to
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
pretend work to work in a sheltered
 
02:32:57.790 --> 02:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
workshop um so those lost lives in the
 
02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
cost of care for those individuals cost
 
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
something um and so you have to really
 
02:33:06.030 --> 02:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
balance the the the the gains against
 
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
the costs the the benefits uh you know
 
02:33:11.269 --> 02:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
do a cost benefit analysis when looking
 
02:33:13.550 --> 02:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
at that I I think of gross cost versus
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
net cost when you think about in New
 
02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we begin train um preparing
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
for for postsecondary transition for
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities by age 14
 
02:33:27.269 --> 02:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
federal law says by 16 overwhelmingly
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
Educators um parents came out and
 
02:33:31.950 --> 02:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
supported keeping it at age 14 because
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
we believe that better prepares children
 
02:33:35.550 --> 02:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
for the whole purpose of special
 
02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
education to leave school prepared to um
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
either go to work or enter
 
02:33:43.150 --> 02:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education and New
 
02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does have a higher percentage
 
02:33:47.309 --> 02:33:47.319 align:start position:0%
of students leaving school prepared for
 
02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
those things than other states and so I
 
02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
I think you can see that while it may
 
02:33:55.070 --> 02:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
cost something be hard to calculate
 
02:33:57.389 --> 02:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
actually how much more it takes cost to
 
02:33:59.190 --> 02:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
send a few minutes at a meeting talking
 
02:34:01.950 --> 02:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
about that um than just than leaving
 
02:34:05.269 --> 02:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
that out of the discussion um but if you
 
02:34:07.269 --> 02:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
consider the children who disabilities
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
who are now working who might not be
 
02:34:12.389 --> 02:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
paying taxes who might not be who are
 
02:34:14.429 --> 02:34:14.439 align:start position:0%
going on to post-secondary education to
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
have very very productive Lives who
 
02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
would not have otherwise that you'd have
 
02:34:21.550 --> 02:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
to subtract that so figure out let's say
 
02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:22.590 align:start position:0%
to subtract that so figure out let's say
it

02:34:22.590 --> 02:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:34:24.990 --> 02:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
costs I'm not really good at math
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
because I'm too tired um let's say it
 
02:34:31.469 --> 02:34:31.479 align:start position:0%
cost $1,000 for to to begin discussing
 
02:34:36.429 --> 02:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
that at 14 then somebody pays $10,000 in
 
02:34:39.030 --> 02:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
extra taxes then that bill really then
 
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
that um rule really cost us minus
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
$9,000 and so that's a savings to the
 
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayer really and I think that because
 
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
anytime our special ed rules have been
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
revised in recent memory there have
 
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
always been collaborative opportunities
 
02:34:55.309 --> 02:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
for parents and Educators and
 
02:34:57.469 --> 02:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
administrators to talk together and
 
02:35:00.349 --> 02:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
we've we've jointly testified on in the
 
02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
past several times because we we know
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
that there is a benefit for some things
 
02:35:08.269 --> 02:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
and after careful discussion decided
 
02:35:09.750 --> 02:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves as a group it was
 
02:35:12.590 --> 02:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
worth it and advocated for that the
 
02:35:14.750 --> 02:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
general education I can only think I
 
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
quickly I could think of one thing in
 
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we don't allow children
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
with or without disabilities to be
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
beaten or electric shocked like they do
 
02:35:25.790 --> 02:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
in other school in other states um does
 
02:35:27.990 --> 02:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
that cost anything I don't know I guess
 
02:35:29.790 --> 02:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
you have to spend more time managing
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
children's Behavior if you're not going
 
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
to beat or shock them but the cost
 
02:35:35.670 --> 02:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
savings is that we get to continue
 
02:35:37.630 --> 02:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
saying we are civilized human
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
beings thank
 
02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:41.349 align:start position:0%
beings thank
you

02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:35:43.950 --> 02:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
okay questions
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
you Mrs D for coming over and seriously
 
02:35:51.269 --> 02:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
for your for the effort that went into
 
02:35:53.750 --> 02:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
coming here under the circumstances I
 
02:35:56.349 --> 02:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
hope all will work out well you know in
 
02:35:59.230 --> 02:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
the short term I just want to understand
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
a bit better where you're coming from
 
02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
because during your testimony you said
 
02:36:04.910 --> 02:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to do a cost benefit
 
02:36:06.429 --> 02:36:06.439 align:start position:0%
analysis and then you provided a bunch
 
02:36:08.510 --> 02:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
of examples where the cost benefit
 
02:36:11.630 --> 02:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
analysis justifies the Investments I'm
 
02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand since this
 
02:36:15.710 --> 02:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
bill just says we want to understand the
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
financial impact in order to do that
 
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analysis why are you
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill because it doesn't
 
02:36:24.990 --> 02:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
require cuts it doesn't attack it it
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
just says we are trying to better
 
02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
understand what the impacts are so we
 
02:36:31.630 --> 02:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
can run that cost benefit analysis can
 
02:36:34.750 --> 02:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
you help me understand that maybe um I'm
 
02:36:37.790 --> 02:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure how our your brain and
 
02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
mind are working together today or not
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
um and so let's go with that that to
 
02:36:44.830 --> 02:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
understand the financial impact you have
 
02:36:46.990 --> 02:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
to understand both what you're spending
 
02:36:49.309 --> 02:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
and what you're getting for that money
 
02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
and and this bill only says what are you
 
02:36:53.309 --> 02:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
spending it doesn't say what are you
 
02:36:55.349 --> 02:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
getting for that and so you're only
 
02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
getting half the
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
picture to do a full analysis it would
 
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
take a lot more time I imagine somebody
 
02:37:03.429 --> 02:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned fiscal notes I imagine you
 
02:37:05.150 --> 02:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
would be seeing a lot of rules that for
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes at indeterminable like you
 
02:37:10.870 --> 02:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
do so often for regular bills here thank
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
you very much it really helped me
 
02:37:14.349 --> 02:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
understand what you're are coming from
 
02:37:14.359 --> 02:37:15.070 align:start position:0%
understand what you're are coming from
thank

02:37:15.070 --> 02:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:37:18.190 --> 02:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
you okay other
 
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
questions very good good so let me just
 
02:37:22.670 --> 02:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
ask briefly if what what you're
 
02:37:25.469 --> 02:37:25.479 align:start position:0%
basically saying is that there should be
 
02:37:29.469 --> 02:37:29.479 align:start position:0%
a netting of um positives and negatives
 
02:37:31.750 --> 02:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
two things but if this this is really
 
02:37:34.110 --> 02:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
focused on out-of-pocket costs of
 
02:37:36.309 --> 02:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
compliance that doesn't
 
02:37:39.070 --> 02:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
preclude uh further analysis of what the
 
02:37:43.309 --> 02:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
benefits uh um or savings um are from
 
02:37:45.269 --> 02:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
implementing the rule right it just
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
simply seeks a disclosure if it's
 
02:37:49.710 --> 02:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
understood in that manner does does it
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
still bother you yeah um definitely does
 
02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:55.309 align:start position:0%
still bother you yeah um definitely does
because

02:37:55.309 --> 02:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:37:58.830 --> 02:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers I I go to town meetings and we
 
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
I live in marac and recently one of our
 
02:38:03.150 --> 02:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
budget um committee members said is
 
02:38:04.750 --> 02:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
there some way we can put a cap on the
 
02:38:06.309 --> 02:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
number of children with disabilities who
 
02:38:08.950 --> 02:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
are allowed to move into our town um and
 
02:38:10.510 --> 02:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
so children with disabilities are
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
definitely scapegoated I've been at
 
02:38:13.710 --> 02:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
meetings where people have turned around
 
02:38:15.469 --> 02:38:15.479 align:start position:0%
my son has been out of school for years
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
now but previously would say that that's
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
the reason our our taxes are so high so
 
02:38:24.510 --> 02:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
if they are only hearing here's how much
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
it costs and not how much is being saved
 
02:38:28.830 --> 02:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
or how much is being gained in the long
 
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
run then you are further stigmatizing
 
02:38:34.030 --> 02:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities and and
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
continuing to make them carry the the
 
02:38:38.190 --> 02:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
weight of the blame for all of the extra
 
02:38:40.150 --> 02:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
money taxpayers are having to spend
 
02:38:42.269 --> 02:38:42.279 align:start position:0%
which is not true and not
 
02:38:45.670 --> 02:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
fair okay thank you very much thank you
 
02:38:47.070 --> 02:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure there are millions of
 
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
examples but I wrote this in the car on
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
the way up here um I was dictating to
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
myself so I could scroll it on this
 
02:38:54.030 --> 02:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
sheet of paper when I got here I think
 
02:38:56.389 --> 02:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
you conveyed your thoughts well um
 
02:38:59.030 --> 02:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions I don't have
 
02:39:02.349 --> 02:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
any other pink cards and if there's
 
02:39:04.030 --> 02:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
nobody else seeking to
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
testify uh we will close the hearing on
 
02:39:07.439 --> 02:39:08.710 align:start position:0%
testify uh we will close the hearing on
HB

02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:08.720 align:start position:0%

03:41:02.830 --> 03:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to introduce the bill at least
 
03:41:05.510 --> 03:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh in looking at the bill uh there are
 
03:41:08.910 --> 03:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
several uh significant changes uh to
 
03:41:11.670 --> 03:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
current law it should be noted however
 
03:41:14.150 --> 03:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
that open enrollment schools are schools
 
03:41:16.590 --> 03:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
where there willing to take tuition
 
03:41:19.150 --> 03:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
students from another within district
 
03:41:22.790 --> 03:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
and out of District um and and of course
 
03:41:25.229 --> 03:41:25.239 align:start position:0%
the cending school is responsible for
 
03:41:30.110 --> 03:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
paying the cost um if it's from another
 
03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
District the whole program started back
 
03:41:32.399 --> 03:41:33.750 align:start position:0%
District the whole program started back
in

03:41:33.750 --> 03:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:41:37.630 --> 03:41:37.640 align:start position:0%

03:41:39.950 --> 03:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
statute a new
 
03:41:45.790 --> 03:41:45.800 align:start position:0%

limit uh the grade levels available they
 
03:43:46.950 --> 03:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
can limit it to Agee levels they can

student uh selection must focus on the
 
03:44:22.790 --> 03:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
goals of the school the receiving
 
03:44:25.189 --> 03:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
school that's in law
 
03:44:28.510 --> 03:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
also um if too many apply trying to get
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
into an open there's a lottery as we do
 
03:44:32.830 --> 03:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
have with the charter schools there's a
 
03:44:34.750 --> 03:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
lottery if there's more people applying
 
03:44:37.229 --> 03:44:37.239 align:start position:0%
to get in than there are seats available
 
03:44:39.510 --> 03:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's done by
 
03:44:42.269 --> 03:44:42.279 align:start position:0%
Lottery uh no student can switch schools
 
03:44:45.189 --> 03:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
more than once in a school year policy
 
03:44:47.750 --> 03:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
of open enrollment schools have to be
 
03:44:50.349 --> 03:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
posted um and the policies in the
 
03:44:52.229 --> 03:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
schools for example if you're coming
 
03:44:54.110 --> 03:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
from a district that has a different
 
03:44:57.149 --> 03:44:57.159 align:start position:0%
policy than the district you're going to
 
03:44:59.550 --> 03:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
the district of the receiving school is
 
03:45:02.309 --> 03:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
the PO those policies are the policies
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
in effect for example if you're talking
 
03:45:06.990 --> 03:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
about suspension expulsion it's not the
 
03:45:09.510 --> 03:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
sending it's the receiving they decide
 
03:45:10.670 --> 03:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
whether you're going to get expelled or
 
03:45:12.269 --> 03:45:12.279 align:start position:0%
not where you're going the Open
 
03:45:14.229 --> 03:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
Enrollment school has that Authority you
 
03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
follow their policies where you're are a
 
03:45:19.990 --> 03:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
student but you're you're listed as a
 
03:45:23.070 --> 03:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
student though in the sending school
 
03:45:25.389 --> 03:45:25.399 align:start position:0%
they have the responsibility for the
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
tuition can be no less than
 
03:45:31.790 --> 03:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
80% the cost of that sending School
 
03:45:33.950 --> 03:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
District or as sending
 
03:45:37.469 --> 03:45:37.479 align:start position:0%
school um There are rules on this uh
 
03:45:41.229 --> 03:45:41.239 align:start position:0%
541a rules uh now the changes that I see
 
03:45:44.229 --> 03:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
here uh which uh represent perel house
 
03:45:46.710 --> 03:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
in the bille there's one area that I
 
03:45:49.469 --> 03:45:49.479 align:start position:0%
think that deserves some of our
 
03:45:53.469 --> 03:45:53.479 align:start position:0%
Focus uh is on page two where it says
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
under budgets each School shall
 
03:45:57.870 --> 03:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
establish a line item in their operating
 
03:46:01.110 --> 03:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
budget on an annual basis reflecting
 
03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
estimated expenditures for an open
 
03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment School
 
03:46:09.429 --> 03:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
tuition by listing it annually and
 
03:46:12.389 --> 03:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
estimated I that may be difficult to
 
03:46:15.750 --> 03:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
do uh I haven't given it much thought it
 
03:46:17.229 --> 03:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
currently says that portion of school
 
03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
district's estimated expenditures on an
 
03:46:21.149 --> 03:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
open enrollment School tuition shall be
 
03:46:23.710 --> 03:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
shown as a separate line in a School
 
03:46:26.830 --> 03:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
District budget that's the way it was
 
03:46:28.630 --> 03:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
now it's each School District shall
 
03:46:31.990 --> 03:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
establish a line item in their operating
 
03:46:35.389 --> 03:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
budget on an annual basis reflecting
 
03:46:37.790 --> 03:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
estimated expenditures
 
03:46:40.469 --> 03:46:40.479 align:start position:0%
so that's all I have to say about it
 
03:46:41.990 --> 03:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
because I have not gotten on the weeds
 
03:46:43.189 --> 03:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
I've been working on a lot of other
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
bills but this one I have not given much
 
03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
Focus I do believe that open enrollment
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
schools serve a purpose and and a good
 
03:46:52.349 --> 03:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
purpose if you have two districts right
 
03:46:54.790 --> 03:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
beside each other one District may have
 
03:46:58.229 --> 03:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
a fine mathematics program or a fine uh
 
03:47:00.309 --> 03:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
career program in in in that school
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
where the other one doesn't isn't it
 
03:47:04.429 --> 03:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
wise to send the kids and so you don't
 
03:47:06.389 --> 03:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
have to duplicate programs and save
 
03:47:09.189 --> 03:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
costs cost efficiencies that's what this
 
03:47:12.030 --> 03:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
program really does and it was done way
 
03:47:16.429 --> 03:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
back in 2009 so at that time uh where
 
03:47:17.870 --> 03:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
we've gone with some of the education
 
03:47:20.830 --> 03:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
Choice programs since a lot farther but
 
03:47:22.870 --> 03:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
this is one that's been established
 
03:47:24.870 --> 03:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
through a tuition type program from one
 
03:47:29.469 --> 03:47:29.479 align:start position:0%
District to another and um and this bill
 
03:47:31.830 --> 03:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
modifies that legislation we've had to
 
03:47:33.590 --> 03:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
get into the weeds as far as what it
 
03:47:37.469 --> 03:47:37.479 align:start position:0%
exactly U modifies I I I can't give you
 
03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
that information right now I haven't
 
03:47:42.070 --> 03:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
well all right thank you um we do have a
 
03:47:47.870 --> 03:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
couple of questions are you yep open to
 
03:47:47.880 --> 03:47:49.189 align:start position:0%
couple of questions are you yep open to
representative

03:47:49.189 --> 03:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:47:51.309 --> 03:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
Ames thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:47:52.950 --> 03:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
03:47:57.309 --> 03:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
question questions plural maybe so
 
03:47:57.319 --> 03:47:58.950 align:start position:0%
question questions plural maybe so
clarification

03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
03:48:01.910 --> 03:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
first how is this different or is it
 
03:48:01.920 --> 03:48:03.510 align:start position:0%
first how is this different or is it
different

03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:48:07.469 --> 03:48:07.479 align:start position:0%
from the many small towns that don't
 
03:48:09.710 --> 03:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
have education in town at all grade
 
03:48:12.110 --> 03:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
levels so they have a k to four or k to
 
03:48:14.149 --> 03:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
six school and then they're paying
 
03:48:14.159 --> 03:48:15.349 align:start position:0%
six school and then they're paying
tuition

03:48:15.349 --> 03:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
03:48:18.670 --> 03:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
to other schools are those schools open
 
03:48:20.269 --> 03:48:20.279 align:start position:0%
enrollment schools is that the same
 
03:48:22.389 --> 03:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
thing no you're talking about a school
 
03:48:24.670 --> 03:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
for example is School District K through
 
03:48:28.030 --> 03:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
six K through 8 they don't have high
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
school right those those schools which
 
03:48:33.389 --> 03:48:33.399 align:start position:0%
we tuition two are approved by that
 
03:48:36.550 --> 03:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
sending school board and agreement is
 
03:48:39.309 --> 03:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
written between the two uh on this
 
03:48:41.550 --> 03:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
particular situation the receiving
 
03:48:43.670 --> 03:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
school May declare themselves as an open
 
03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment School
 
03:48:49.030 --> 03:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
and you as a parent in the sending dist
 
03:48:50.750 --> 03:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
we' like your child to go to that
 
03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
program so then the school that you're
 
03:48:57.030 --> 03:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
in has to pay no less than 50% of the
 
03:48:59.910 --> 03:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
tuition cost to the open enrollment
 
03:49:02.189 --> 03:49:02.199 align:start position:0%
school that's how I see it it's like a
 
03:49:04.110 --> 03:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
charter school the parent is saying I
 
03:49:08.229 --> 03:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
want my child there and and by declaring
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
themselves I believe there's one open
 
03:49:10.950 --> 03:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment school in the state right now
 
03:49:12.469 --> 03:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
that does this I don't know which one it
 
03:49:14.469 --> 03:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
is that's if you look in the fiscal
 
03:49:16.750 --> 03:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
notes that's what that fiscal note says
 
03:49:18.030 --> 03:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's why I was looking just before
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
this meeting and uh so uh it's it's
 
03:49:24.030 --> 03:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
running the similar fashion where the
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
parent says I'd like to have my child
 
03:49:28.670 --> 03:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
going there um it's a little bit
 
03:49:31.149 --> 03:49:31.159 align:start position:0%
different than a tuition program where
 
03:49:34.030 --> 03:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
there's an agreement between the two
 
03:49:36.309 --> 03:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
districts by school
 
03:49:39.750 --> 03:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
boards no fa I know what thank you
 
03:49:39.760 --> 03:49:40.910 align:start position:0%
boards no fa I know what thank you
that's

03:49:40.910 --> 03:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:49:45.469 --> 03:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
helpful so related to that on page one
 
03:49:48.510 --> 03:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill lines 9 through 14 where
 
03:49:48.520 --> 03:49:49.670 align:start position:0%
of the bill lines 9 through 14 where
they

03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:49:49.680 --> 03:49:51.229 align:start position:0%
they
Define

03:49:51.229 --> 03:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
Define
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
um tuition and it
 
03:49:57.870 --> 03:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
says the pupil's the proposed language
 
03:49:59.630 --> 03:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
the pupil's sending District shall pay
 
03:50:02.309 --> 03:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
the receiving District an amount equal
 
03:50:04.510 --> 03:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
to not less than 80% of the sending
 
03:50:06.950 --> 03:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
District's average cost per pupil and
 
03:50:11.229 --> 03:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
goes on so my question relative to that
 
03:50:13.630 --> 03:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
is am I correct in believing that this
 
03:50:17.149 --> 03:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
language is setting up a scenario
 
03:50:20.189 --> 03:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
where a parent could request their child
 
03:50:23.710 --> 03:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
to go to an open enrollment School whose
 
03:50:25.550 --> 03:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
average cost per student is considerably
 
03:50:28.269 --> 03:50:28.279 align:start position:0%
more than the cost at the sending
 
03:50:30.030 --> 03:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
District I think you're reading it
 
03:50:31.550 --> 03:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
correctly school will have to accept
 
03:50:31.560 --> 03:50:33.309 align:start position:0%
correctly school will have to accept
that

03:50:33.309 --> 03:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:50:33.319 --> 03:50:35.830 align:start position:0%
that
yes

03:50:35.830 --> 03:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:50:38.469 --> 03:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
interesting thank you okay
 
03:50:38.479 --> 03:50:40.790 align:start position:0%
interesting thank you okay
representative

03:50:40.790 --> 03:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:50:53.189 --> 03:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:56.750 --> 03:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
I I'm pausing on this line
 
03:51:01.550 --> 03:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
item um rephrasing of the line
 
03:51:05.870 --> 03:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
item uh section subsection and uh so
 
03:51:08.590 --> 03:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
wondering how a line item would work
 
03:51:12.510 --> 03:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
for child who comes into a functioning
 
03:51:14.670 --> 03:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
school district and is part of the the
 
03:51:17.110 --> 03:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
general population I mean
 
03:51:20.389 --> 03:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
what you estimate ahead of time what
 
03:51:22.070 --> 03:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
what you're going to charge for that
 
03:51:25.790 --> 03:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
child's attendance but uh but in terms
 
03:51:28.469 --> 03:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
of having an account that you're going
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:51:34.670 --> 03:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
charging costs to a line item that
 
03:51:42.750 --> 03:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:45.910 --> 03:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
work I think the talks about estimates
 
03:51:45.920 --> 03:51:47.110 align:start position:0%
work I think the talks about estimates
you're

03:51:47.110 --> 03:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
you're
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
projecting um based upon what uh maybe
 
03:51:54.950 --> 03:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
the past history uh but uh that is
 
03:51:56.670 --> 03:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
that's why I open up saying there's that
 
03:51:59.910 --> 03:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
area right there that I feel that uh how
 
03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's worded makes
 
03:52:06.189 --> 03:52:06.199 align:start position:0%
it difficult for the sending school to
 
03:52:08.670 --> 03:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
know or project uh what they're going to
 
03:52:15.710 --> 03:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:18.389 --> 03:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
representative Pap Miller thank you Mr
 
03:52:20.149 --> 03:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative lad
 
03:52:22.110 --> 03:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
for present for introducing the bill and
 
03:52:25.389 --> 03:52:25.399 align:start position:0%
taking questions on to the um in regards
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
to the concerns expressed that a um open
 
03:52:30.870 --> 03:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment School may receive less
 
03:52:33.389 --> 03:52:33.399 align:start position:0%
tuition than their costs is there
 
03:52:35.950 --> 03:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
anything in this bill forcing anybody to
 
03:52:38.990 --> 03:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
become an open enrollment school no
 
03:52:41.429 --> 03:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
there's nothing there and when you have
 
03:52:43.070 --> 03:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
these two these two accounts whether
 
03:52:44.189 --> 03:52:44.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to have an account for the
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
kids which you're receiving money for
 
03:52:47.910 --> 03:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
the students which are enrolled in your
 
03:52:51.309 --> 03:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
school you're now being asked to write
 
03:52:54.349 --> 03:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
an account for those which are going to
 
03:52:56.469 --> 03:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
the receiving
 
03:53:00.790 --> 03:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
school and the money that that students
 
03:53:03.070 --> 03:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
going to need is in the other account
 
03:53:05.309 --> 03:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
right the first account so you're going
 
03:53:06.790 --> 03:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
to have to take some out of one account
 
03:53:08.910 --> 03:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
to throw it in another account to cover
 
03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
what you estimate to be the cost for
 
03:53:13.469 --> 03:53:13.479 align:start position:0%
sending to the receiving school right
 
03:53:16.830 --> 03:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
and a quick follow up thank you and in
 
03:53:18.630 --> 03:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
regards to the very last paragraph that
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
we were talking about about the
 
03:53:19.920 --> 03:53:21.550 align:start position:0%
we were talking about about the
estimating

03:53:21.550 --> 03:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
estimating
 
03:53:24.550 --> 03:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
lines in your reading of the previous
 
03:53:27.189 --> 03:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
language and new language do you see any
 
03:53:29.189 --> 03:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
substantial difference between the
 
03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
current obligations versus the new ones
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
because frankly I don't see one but I
 
03:53:35.070 --> 03:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
don't see it either I don't see it
 
03:53:36.910 --> 03:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
either I I I see it that the money's
 
03:53:38.110 --> 03:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
going to have to come from the budget
 
03:53:39.630 --> 03:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
and there's what you got in your
 
03:53:43.149 --> 03:53:43.159 align:start position:0%
adequacy funds are there and but this is
 
03:53:45.229 --> 03:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
saying that they want to have have it in
 
03:53:48.990 --> 03:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
a separate line item which so you have
 
03:53:51.429 --> 03:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
to split something up thank you how much
 
03:53:52.349 --> 03:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
03:53:54.670 --> 03:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
know I wasn't able to find a difference
 
03:53:56.469 --> 03:53:56.479 align:start position:0%
in the two sentences representative
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so
 
03:54:04.269 --> 03:54:04.279 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to the sort of how this
 
03:54:06.990 --> 03:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
could potentially impact CTE programs
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
because I know that one of the
 
03:54:11.670 --> 03:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
challenges uh that sending districts
 
03:54:14.870 --> 03:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
face in with CTE programs is any class
 
03:54:16.110 --> 03:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
schedules and
 
03:54:19.110 --> 03:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
transportation so would this provide
 
03:54:20.830 --> 03:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
additional opportunities for students
 
03:54:23.149 --> 03:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
who are interested in Career and
 
03:54:26.269 --> 03:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
Technical education uh to take full
 
03:54:28.510 --> 03:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
advantage of those programs it would
 
03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
certainly help and I think there's
 
03:54:32.269 --> 03:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
another way that folks are looking at
 
03:54:34.349 --> 03:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
right now is for the students in that
 
03:54:36.030 --> 03:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
sending District that wants to get over
 
03:54:39.309 --> 03:54:39.319 align:start position:0%
here where the CTE program exists to be
 
03:54:43.030 --> 03:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the program that exists so
 
03:54:45.710 --> 03:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
that the everything received over here
 
03:54:48.349 --> 03:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
is now received over here so they become
 
03:54:50.870 --> 03:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
a student of that school and take all
 
03:54:53.550 --> 03:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
their general education courses as well
 
03:54:55.870 --> 03:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
in the school that they're at for CTE so
 
03:54:57.750 --> 03:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
you don't you're eliminating all the
 
03:55:00.189 --> 03:55:00.199 align:start position:0%
transportation that's the way it would
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:07.070 --> 03:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
there um representative
 
03:55:09.510 --> 03:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
fellows um yes I'd like to get back to
 
03:55:12.309 --> 03:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
the the budget question and the listing
 
03:55:15.830 --> 03:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
something in the budget and so so I want
 
03:55:18.030 --> 03:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that the new language says
 
03:55:18.040 --> 03:55:19.790 align:start position:0%
the fact that the new language says
estimated

03:55:19.790 --> 03:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
03:55:23.550 --> 03:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
expenditure um standard practice for a
 
03:55:25.389 --> 03:55:25.399 align:start position:0%
business administrator in a school
 
03:55:29.870 --> 03:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
district is that if they they don't know
 
03:55:33.269 --> 03:55:33.279 align:start position:0%
um for sure they will have to spend uh
 
03:55:35.750 --> 03:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
make an expenditure out of a certain
 
03:55:39.030 --> 03:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
category of expenditures but they might
 
03:55:40.590 --> 03:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
what they would normally put in the
 
03:55:41.670 --> 03:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
budget would be
 
03:55:46.030 --> 03:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
$1 because you can't make an
 
03:55:49.790 --> 03:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
expenditure into an that's related to an
 
03:55:52.870 --> 03:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
account that has zero as a budget but if
 
03:55:56.710 --> 03:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
it says $1 you it can be amended by this
 
03:55:58.990 --> 03:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
depending on the amount of the money by
 
03:56:02.550 --> 03:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
um by the school board so to say
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
estimated expenditure I think um really
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
creates a problem does does that make
 
03:56:10.229 --> 03:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
sense to
 
03:56:12.510 --> 03:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
you quite truthfully I'm having a hard
 
03:56:14.309 --> 03:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
time understanding between between the
 
03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
two sentences cuz estimated expenditure
 
03:56:20.269 --> 03:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
so um I don't
 
03:56:27.670 --> 03:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
believe yeah well so that doesn't make
 
03:56:30.750 --> 03:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
any sense either because in your budget
 
03:56:34.389 --> 03:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
a school district uh you know a business
 
03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
administrator unless they know that
 
03:56:39.389 --> 03:56:39.399 align:start position:0%
students are going to go to an open
 
03:56:41.790 --> 03:56:41.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment school what they would do is
 
03:56:44.510 --> 03:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
they would put $1 on that budget budget
 
03:56:47.590 --> 03:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
line because that makes it available to
 
03:56:50.349 --> 03:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
transfer some funds into that if it
 
03:56:52.670 --> 03:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
should be needed because if you have a
 
03:56:55.950 --> 03:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
line that says zero you can't transfer
 
03:56:58.710 --> 03:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
to that line so I think the
 
03:57:02.389 --> 03:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
original um language has a problem from
 
03:57:08.070 --> 03:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:10.229 --> 03:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
chair any
 
03:57:13.910 --> 03:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
response no okay representative papich M
 
03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's a very brief comment I just wanted
 
03:57:18.070 --> 03:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
to say
 
03:57:20.590 --> 03:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
that this is not an executive session
 
03:57:22.309 --> 03:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
but I would be happy to talk a lot about
 
03:57:23.950 --> 03:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
that in the executive session and go
 
03:57:25.950 --> 03:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
into the details I just don't want to
 
03:57:28.389 --> 03:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
phrase it as a question here because it
 
03:57:31.469 --> 03:57:31.479 align:start position:0%
would be unfair at this time so trust me
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
we can address that thank you
 
03:57:35.870 --> 03:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative mcquire thank you Mr
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:57:40.149 --> 03:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
question who makes the decision how much
 
03:57:43.149 --> 03:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
money will be sent from the sending
 
03:57:45.389 --> 03:57:45.399 align:start position:0%
District to the receiving District this
 
03:57:48.149 --> 03:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
says this is very vague in terms of not
 
03:57:49.550 --> 03:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
less than
 
03:57:51.790 --> 03:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
80% I would have to look back
 
03:57:53.229 --> 03:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
historically how that's been done in
 
03:57:55.070 --> 03:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
District said the same language exists
 
03:57:55.080 --> 03:57:55.870 align:start position:0%
District said the same language exists
in

03:57:55.870 --> 03:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
both this proposed law and the new I
 
03:58:01.110 --> 03:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
know this is not new that's not new yeah
 
03:58:03.910 --> 03:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
may I follow up yes
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm under the impression that
 
03:58:10.149 --> 03:58:10.159 align:start position:0%
this is not a a program that's succeeded
 
03:58:12.910 --> 03:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
because there's only one um open
 
03:58:15.269 --> 03:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
enrollment School right and and the
 
03:58:18.910 --> 03:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
danger for a school deciding to be open
 
03:58:22.630 --> 03:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
enrollment is a district could send them
 
03:58:25.189 --> 03:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
their most expensive student right a
 
03:58:29.510 --> 03:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
special ed student with some no he's
 
03:58:32.590 --> 03:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
shaking his head well the the parent the
 
03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
parent of this you know whatever student
 
03:58:38.389 --> 03:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
could send them of a $200,000 student
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
could decide I'm going to that school
 
03:58:42.870 --> 03:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
and and as far as I read this the Open
 
03:58:45.269 --> 03:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
Enrollment school doesn't can't say no
 
03:58:46.990 --> 03:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
and the other District says well okay
 
03:58:49.030 --> 03:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
I'll give you your 30 thou you know your
 
03:58:51.710 --> 03:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
$20,000 or whatever the number if I were
 
03:58:54.070 --> 03:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
an open enrollment School administrator
 
03:58:56.149 --> 03:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
or principal and I had an open
 
03:58:57.950 --> 03:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment school that was declining in
 
03:58:59.790 --> 03:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
population but had some wonderful
 
03:59:02.670 --> 03:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
programs I'd gladly solicit from all the
 
03:59:04.269 --> 03:59:04.279 align:start position:0%
districts around me and try to draft
 
03:59:05.950 --> 03:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
their students off and bring them into
 
03:59:08.149 --> 03:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
my school so I can load it up and I can
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
sustain my program I wouldn't worry
 
03:59:12.070 --> 03:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
about what happens on the other side of
 
03:59:14.950 --> 03:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
the leder but the other school but I I
 
03:59:16.710 --> 03:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
would I would sell my
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:22.960 --> 03:59:24.590 align:start position:0%
 
competition

03:59:24.590 --> 03:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
competition
 
03:59:27.189 --> 03:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
okay I guess my question is it seems
 
03:59:28.990 --> 03:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
that one of the key things being changed
 
03:59:31.309 --> 03:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
here is to label schools as either
 
03:59:34.389 --> 03:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
sending or receiving but I don't get the
 
03:59:37.389 --> 03:59:37.399 align:start position:0%
sense uh that it fully flushes out what
 
03:59:39.670 --> 03:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
the implications are particularly for
 
03:59:42.030 --> 03:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
the sending School the receiving school
 
03:59:44.670 --> 03:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
can elect to receive
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
but the sending school has no
 
03:59:49.229 --> 03:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
choice is that am I reading it the way
 
03:59:51.429 --> 03:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
you understand it if it's an open that's
 
03:59:55.429 --> 03:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
the way I read it okay yes all right um
 
03:59:57.790 --> 03:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
are we breaking new
 
04:00:00.590 --> 04:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
ground and there there are there excuse
 
04:00:03.670 --> 04:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
me there are people from doe here we
 
04:00:06.790 --> 04:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
have the department
 
04:00:12.030 --> 04:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
fine okay representative Fells um yes so
 
04:00:14.590 --> 04:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
so you just said that right now now it
 
04:00:17.149 --> 04:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
would make Financial sense for a school
 
04:00:19.229 --> 04:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
to say that they're open enrollment
 
04:00:21.630 --> 04:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
school because they have empty seats
 
04:00:24.269 --> 04:00:24.279 align:start position:0%
that that would be a beneficial
 
04:00:26.429 --> 04:00:26.439 align:start position:0%
financially if they could fill them but
 
04:00:29.710 --> 04:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
was that the situation back in
 
04:00:32.149 --> 04:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
2009 my recollection is that's when
 
04:00:34.630 --> 04:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
enrollment was very high and there were
 
04:00:37.070 --> 04:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
there there were schools that you know
 
04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
they were bursting at the scams they had
 
04:00:42.269 --> 04:00:42.279 align:start position:0%
so many students you are correct back
 
04:00:43.950 --> 04:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
then there was about 210,000 students
 
04:00:45.149 --> 04:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
students in the state now we're down
 
04:00:49.229 --> 04:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
around 160 and so they had the students
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
one and I don't know if there was one at
 
04:00:58.429 --> 04:00:58.439 align:start position:0%
that time but that's when the law came
 
04:01:01.229 --> 04:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
in effect representative
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
Dan thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:01:08.429 --> 04:01:08.439 align:start position:0%
again so would you comment on the
 
04:01:11.830 --> 04:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
potential fiscal impact to the sending
 
04:01:14.149 --> 04:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
District if the number student students
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
that they're sending to one or more open
 
04:01:19.389 --> 04:01:19.399 align:start position:0%
enrollment schools if there were
 
04:01:22.750 --> 04:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
more diminishes the sending District's
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
student enrollment but not enough for
 
04:01:27.309 --> 04:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
them to close a classroom or otherwise
 
04:01:31.790 --> 04:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
reduce costs so they're adding what is
 
04:01:33.670 --> 04:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
tuition costs to their existing
 
04:01:37.429 --> 04:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
correct well there there if it's going
 
04:01:42.590 --> 04:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
to be if they're going to take from one
 
04:01:44.269 --> 04:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
school to another school with in the
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
school district they're still going to
 
04:01:47.429 --> 04:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
have to provide the
 
04:01:49.429 --> 04:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
transportation going outside the
 
04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
district they don't have to provide
 
04:01:53.309 --> 04:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
transportation so there
 
04:01:55.830 --> 04:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
might if you're going to pay 80% the
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
other 20% is going to be where it's
 
04:01:59.389 --> 04:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
going to be left in the district that's
 
04:02:01.750 --> 04:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
how I see it and you're asking somebody
 
04:02:03.830 --> 04:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
right here has never done this before as
 
04:02:06.710 --> 04:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
a in a school so it's probably wise to
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
ask folks that are more familiar with
 
04:02:12.229 --> 04:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
open enrollment which I am not familiar
 
04:02:14.550 --> 04:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
with that
 
04:02:16.750 --> 04:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
okay I think it's come time to allow the
 
04:02:20.110 --> 04:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you introduce have a good
 
04:02:23.550 --> 04:02:23.560 align:start position:0%

executive director of the New Hampshire
 
04:02:53.429 --> 04:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
school boards Association we are opposed
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
to the bill um I think what is most
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
important for this committee to consider
 
04:03:00.590 --> 04:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
when it's considering House Bill
 
04:03:03.790 --> 04:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
771 is that there is currently a case
 
04:03:05.910 --> 04:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
pending before the New Hampshire Supreme
 
04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
Court relative to what the operations
 
04:03:12.950 --> 04:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
are um and the obligation of a district
 
04:03:15.189 --> 04:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
um that has not not adopted the Open
 
04:03:17.630 --> 04:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
Enrollment statute but yet is having
 
04:03:20.030 --> 04:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
students for lack of a way of putting it
 
04:03:23.550 --> 04:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
poached from another school district um
 
04:03:25.389 --> 04:03:25.399 align:start position:0%
representative lad is correct there's
 
04:03:28.189 --> 04:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
only one open enrollment sta One open
 
04:03:31.269 --> 04:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
enrollment school um in the state right
 
04:03:34.830 --> 04:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
now um there was a matter that um was
 
04:03:37.590 --> 04:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
appealed to the State Board of Education
 
04:03:39.309 --> 04:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
the hearings officer had one
 
04:03:42.269 --> 04:03:42.279 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the statute um the
 
04:03:44.110 --> 04:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education ignor the
 
04:03:45.910 --> 04:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
hearings officer's recommendation and
 
04:03:48.309 --> 04:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
issued its own findings um so that
 
04:03:49.870 --> 04:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
matter um was filed with the New
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court I believe in it
 
04:03:54.630 --> 04:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
was either August or October I I have it
 
04:03:57.429 --> 04:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
here on my notes um before any changes
 
04:03:59.950 --> 04:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
are made to the open enrollment statute
 
04:04:02.149 --> 04:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
nsba believes that we should let the
 
04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
litigation sort of play itself out there
 
04:04:07.750 --> 04:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
are questions about the main question is
 
04:04:11.229 --> 04:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
if one school district um authoriz is
 
04:04:13.269 --> 04:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
authorized by its voters to become an
 
04:04:16.349 --> 04:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
open enrollment school but a neighboring
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
School District does not is not an open
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment School the voters have not
 
04:04:23.189 --> 04:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
followed the process in RSA
 
04:04:26.830 --> 04:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
194d does the district that has not
 
04:04:29.670 --> 04:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
adopted the open Roman statute have to
 
04:04:32.070 --> 04:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
pay tuition to the school district in
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
which those children wish to attend so
 
04:04:37.750 --> 04:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's what's pending and we have one
 
04:04:39.750 --> 04:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the statute the State
 
04:04:41.070 --> 04:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
Board of Education had a different
 
04:04:43.189 --> 04:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
interpre of the statute the attorneys
 
04:04:44.910 --> 04:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
represent one of the school districts at
 
04:04:47.790 --> 04:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
issue has an interpretation um so that
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
matter is pending before the New
 
04:04:51.149 --> 04:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court that needs to be
 
04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
resolved first um because I I think
 
04:04:55.590 --> 04:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
there going to be more and more of these
 
04:04:57.670 --> 04:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
open enrollment schools perhaps coming
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
forward as we're seeing changes to I'll
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
just call it school choice for lack of a
 
04:05:03.630 --> 04:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
better way of putting it but until this
 
04:05:06.670 --> 04:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
statute is is clarified as to what is
 
04:05:09.389 --> 04:05:09.399 align:start position:0%
the tuition obligation of a sending
 
04:05:11.550 --> 04:05:11.560 align:start position:0%
School District that has not authorized
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
or not adopted the Open Enrollment
 
04:05:15.590 --> 04:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
statute we think that we should we
 
04:05:18.030 --> 04:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
should pause any changes to RSA
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
194d and um I think that's our Prime our
 
04:05:24.670 --> 04:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
Prime um objection um I do have some
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
objections relative to the the fiscal
 
04:05:31.469 --> 04:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
aspect um page two line four excuse me
 
04:05:33.510 --> 04:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
each district shall establish a line
 
04:05:35.750 --> 04:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
item in their operating budget on an
 
04:05:37.790 --> 04:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
annual basis reflecting estimated
 
04:05:39.389 --> 04:05:39.399 align:start position:0%
expenditures for open enrollment
 
04:05:41.429 --> 04:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
tuitions that's all well and good if
 
04:05:42.790 --> 04:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
that school district has adopted the
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
Open Enrollment provision ision of RSA
 
04:05:46.710 --> 04:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
194d but if that Pro that that school
 
04:05:49.389 --> 04:05:49.399 align:start position:0%
district has not adopted the provisions
 
04:05:50.870 --> 04:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know why they need to be a line
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
item in in a particular budget likewise
 
04:05:56.070 --> 04:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
with all due respect this is generally
 
04:05:57.670 --> 04:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
local money that's going to be used as
 
04:05:59.469 --> 04:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
tuition money we don't think the state
 
04:06:01.469 --> 04:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
should be telling local school districts
 
04:06:03.389 --> 04:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
what line items they necessarily have to
 
04:06:05.229 --> 04:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
have as it for things that don't
 
04:06:07.149 --> 04:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily relate to adequacy but our
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
biggest concern is that there's a
 
04:06:10.670 --> 04:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
pending Supreme Court case nhba does not
 
04:06:12.630 --> 04:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
believe we should be amending anything
 
04:06:14.590 --> 04:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
relative to the open rment statute until
 
04:06:16.429 --> 04:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
we get some sort of clarification from
 
04:06:18.309 --> 04:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
the courts with that I will try to
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
answer some questions I don't know the
 
04:06:22.870 --> 04:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
statute that well thank you I think
 
04:06:25.349 --> 04:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
you've hit the question I asked uh
 
04:06:27.750 --> 04:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
previously about whether the sending
 
04:06:29.870 --> 04:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
School District's hand would be forced
 
04:06:32.349 --> 04:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh okay let's see
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
representative Earth and then
 
04:06:37.389 --> 04:06:37.399 align:start position:0%
mner thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
04:06:39.910 --> 04:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you take my question so putting
 
04:06:42.870 --> 04:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
aside the changes that are being made
 
04:06:45.830 --> 04:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
here do you have the same concerns with
 
04:06:48.910 --> 04:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
the law as it exists today thank you
 
04:06:51.510 --> 04:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
very much uh for the question
 
04:06:53.550 --> 04:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
representative this the
 
04:06:56.910 --> 04:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
statute itself I think is unclear in
 
04:06:59.229 --> 04:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
some places and if the statute were more
 
04:07:01.790 --> 04:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
clear in some places perhaps the the
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
litigation that's pending right now
 
04:07:06.910 --> 04:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
would not have been necessary so um
 
04:07:09.309 --> 04:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
again to mind I've never worked closely
 
04:07:11.229 --> 04:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
with this statute again there's only one
 
04:07:13.870 --> 04:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
other statute or one school District
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
that has adopted the Open Enrollment
 
04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
statute I will say this this is my
 
04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
anecdotal recommendations as well too um
 
04:07:25.149 --> 04:07:25.159 align:start position:0%
that a number of years ago I want to say
 
04:07:28.070 --> 04:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
15 maybe more there was another school
 
04:07:31.030 --> 04:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
district that sought to invoke or become
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
an open enrollment school um they
 
04:07:36.349 --> 04:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
received um a legal opinion I believe
 
04:07:37.710 --> 04:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education that
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
was contrary to what the state board
 
04:07:42.510 --> 04:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
ruled maybe a year or so ago so to your
 
04:07:44.670 --> 04:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
question representative the statute the
 
04:07:48.070 --> 04:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
full totality of RSA 194d I think is
 
04:07:50.670 --> 04:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
unclear in in in some places and
 
04:07:53.229 --> 04:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
probably could stand for some amendments
 
04:07:53.239 --> 04:07:56.070 align:start position:0%
probably could stand for some amendments
moving

04:07:56.070 --> 04:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:58.910 --> 04:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
forward representative guire thank you
 
04:08:00.269 --> 04:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:08:02.349 --> 04:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
question so I don't understand your your
 
04:08:03.990 --> 04:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
first point you said there's a Supreme
 
04:08:07.149 --> 04:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
Court case it's vague we should because
 
04:08:09.630 --> 04:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
the law is vague uh so we should wait
 
04:08:11.229 --> 04:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
and see what the Supreme Court says it
 
04:08:14.670 --> 04:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
really means why don't we do what's
 
04:08:17.670 --> 04:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
being done here on page one line n and
 
04:08:21.309 --> 04:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
make it clear or if if that's not enough
 
04:08:23.309 --> 04:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
you know make it even clearer in other
 
04:08:25.710 --> 04:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
places that are vague and and have it
 
04:08:28.109 --> 04:08:28.119 align:start position:0%
really say whatever we want it to say
 
04:08:31.070 --> 04:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
and and let people not spend their money
 
04:08:32.750 --> 04:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
at the Supreme Court not wait for the
 
04:08:34.630 --> 04:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court all that sort of stuff
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the much question or
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
for for the question represent yeah I
 
04:08:39.990 --> 04:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
mean this body can certainly make the
 
04:08:43.710 --> 04:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
Amendments you know as as it sees fit it
 
04:08:45.469 --> 04:08:45.479 align:start position:0%
I think the question would be that
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to get opposing
 
04:08:48.830 --> 04:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
interpretations of what the statute
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
should say then or at least opposing
 
04:08:52.109 --> 04:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
views on what I we get that all the time
 
04:08:54.189 --> 04:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
too I I'm not saying that's not not a
 
04:08:56.189 --> 04:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
reason to do it representative but yeah
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
certainly the the the question the gist
 
04:09:01.109 --> 04:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
of the question is what are the spending
 
04:09:02.710 --> 04:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
obligations of a district that has not
 
04:09:05.189 --> 04:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
adopted open enrollment schools Can a
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
district that has adopted the Open
 
04:09:08.750 --> 04:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
Enrollment statute poach students from
 
04:09:09.990 --> 04:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
another school
 
04:09:12.590 --> 04:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
district and and and just make the
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
sending District pay tuition even though
 
04:09:16.389 --> 04:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
they even though that sending district
 
04:09:18.389 --> 04:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
has not become an open enrollment School
 
04:09:21.189 --> 04:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
itself that's the gist of the issue
 
04:09:21.199 --> 04:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
itself that's the gist of the issue
thank

04:09:21.990 --> 04:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:09:24.790 --> 04:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
you representative Ames
 
04:09:27.750 --> 04:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you're the point is well
 
04:09:29.670 --> 04:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
taken that we should be as informed as
 
04:09:34.710 --> 04:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
we can be on this uh issue and um and to
 
04:09:37.349 --> 04:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
that end we need to understand the
 
04:09:40.910 --> 04:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
litigation that is directly on point and
 
04:09:43.630 --> 04:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
it would be really helpful to me in
 
04:09:46.950 --> 04:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
order to do all of that to have at least
 
04:09:51.189 --> 04:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
a link to the uh litigation so that uh I
 
04:09:54.349 --> 04:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
am maybe the others here can uh can read
 
04:09:56.030 --> 04:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
what the complaint says and what the
 
04:09:57.630 --> 04:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
response says because that's probably
 
04:10:00.269 --> 04:10:00.279 align:start position:0%
all there is right now thank you very
 
04:10:01.750 --> 04:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
much representative I am not in
 
04:10:03.750 --> 04:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
possession of all those documents I can
 
04:10:04.950 --> 04:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
reach out to the attorney that's
 
04:10:06.269 --> 04:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
representing the school district at
 
04:10:08.229 --> 04:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
issue and see what I can what I what I
 
04:10:09.469 --> 04:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
can gather and pass along to the
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
committee one other thing too just if I
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
may uh Mr chair for the moment I've used
 
04:10:15.790 --> 04:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
the word poach a couple of times that
 
04:10:17.469 --> 04:10:17.479 align:start position:0%
may be too strong of a word I don't mean
 
04:10:19.750 --> 04:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
to imply that there's any wrongdoing
 
04:10:21.950 --> 04:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'll just say um perhaps actively
 
04:10:23.670 --> 04:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
solicit students from outside the school
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
district I I don't want to I don't want
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
to apply any you know negative intent to
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
that word by chance so I I apologize for
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
using that word that may be a little bit
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
04:10:37.750 --> 04:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
loaded okay um can I ask our committee
 
04:10:39.710 --> 04:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
researcher gen for perhaps you can run
 
04:10:41.670 --> 04:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
that link down for us as representative
 
04:10:44.670 --> 04:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
Ames asked
 
04:10:46.469 --> 04:10:46.479 align:start position:0%
could you run down the link to this
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
pending Supreme Court case I can I can

Fells thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:11:08.229 --> 04:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
Mr Christina does the Schoolboard

Association have any perspective to
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
share on the broad concept of increasing
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
the number of open enrollment schools
 
04:11:17.349 --> 04:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much uh for the
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
question representative um specifically
 
04:11:22.229 --> 04:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
no I will say if two school districts
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
want to become open enrollment schools
 
04:11:26.710 --> 04:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
and engage in some sort of agreement for
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
the students then two school districts
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
are can can can can do that it's not NH
 
04:11:33.790 --> 04:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
hba's position to because it has being
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
an open enrollment school has to be
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
authorized by the voters via warrant
 
04:11:39.149 --> 04:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
article so you know we don't question
 
04:11:41.070 --> 04:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
what what voters in a particular
 
04:11:42.990 --> 04:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
District do if voters in two districts
 
04:11:48.269 --> 04:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:51.070 --> 04:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
prerogative representative Pap thank you
 
04:11:53.229 --> 04:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and nice seeing you again a
 
04:11:55.469 --> 04:11:55.479 align:start position:0%
pleasure thank you um just a quick
 
04:11:57.070 --> 04:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
question since you were talking about
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
the you know soliciting of students my
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of the NHS Ba's concern
 
04:12:05.189 --> 04:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
seems to not be related to whether the
 
04:12:07.710 --> 04:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
students are solicited or not but simply
 
04:12:08.910 --> 04:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
to the fact that they are going to
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
another school district and the you know
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
sending School District now owes tuition
 
04:12:15.389 --> 04:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
even though they didn't adopt that do I
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
understand that correctly or is there a
 
04:12:19.389 --> 04:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
Nuance there regarding whether the
 
04:12:22.030 --> 04:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
receiving District solicit students or
 
04:12:23.630 --> 04:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
they just knock on the door by
 
04:12:24.910 --> 04:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
themselves right thank you for the
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
question representative Our concern is
 
04:12:28.990 --> 04:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
that we believe that the State Board of
 
04:12:31.950 --> 04:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
Education misinterpreted the statute and
 
04:12:34.469 --> 04:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
is misapplying the statute um and the
 
04:12:37.870 --> 04:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
concerns with it our concerns with that
 
04:12:41.149 --> 04:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
is that the the the the State Board of
 
04:12:42.750 --> 04:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
the state board's interpretation of the
 
04:12:42.760 --> 04:12:43.910 align:start position:0%
the state board's interpretation of the
statute

04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:12:46.349 --> 04:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
would have potentially would have
 
04:12:49.830 --> 04:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
significant ramifications Statewide we
 
04:12:52.870 --> 04:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
believe that in order for a student to
 
04:12:55.990 --> 04:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
be to a to in order for a student to be
 
04:12:57.950 --> 04:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
a sending student to a different School
 
04:12:59.830 --> 04:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
District under the Open Enrollment
 
04:13:02.550 --> 04:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
statute the sending District also has to
 
04:13:05.070 --> 04:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
adopt the Open Enrollment
 
04:13:09.790 --> 04:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
statute oh quick followup yes I agree I
 
04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
understand that does it make any
 
04:13:13.510 --> 04:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
difference whether the rece receiving
 
04:13:15.389 --> 04:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
District solicits the students or the
 
04:13:17.429 --> 04:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
students just ask to go there without
 
04:13:19.269 --> 04:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
any communication yes thank you for the
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
question repres I mean if the students
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
ask to go there without their District
 
04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
being an open Roman school there are
 
04:13:26.950 --> 04:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
potentially other avenues the best
 
04:13:30.189 --> 04:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
interest standard under RC 1933 manifest
 
04:13:33.030 --> 04:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
educational hardship also under RSA 193
 
04:13:34.830 --> 04:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
colon 3 where the districts could
 
04:13:36.429 --> 04:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
presumably enter into some sort of
 
04:13:39.990 --> 04:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
tuition agreement if they wanted thank
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
you okay do we have further questions
 
04:13:46.590 --> 04:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
representative fellows right that that
 
04:13:48.910 --> 04:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
last comment was the answer to my
 
04:13:51.109 --> 04:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
question very good yeah good to have
 
04:13:54.670 --> 04:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
that rsay citation yeah okay I think we
 
04:13:58.830 --> 04:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
have gone the full round thank you very
 
04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:16.149 --> 04:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon Mr
 
04:14:18.070 --> 04:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and committee members I'm David
 
04:14:20.109 --> 04:14:20.119 align:start position:0%
Trumble from the town aware I have
 
04:14:22.710 --> 04:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
concerns about the bill and uh confess
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
to not being an expert on this issue but
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
hearing from our sponsor who also
 
04:14:31.309 --> 04:14:31.319 align:start position:0%
admitted it was had some of those same
 
04:14:33.030 --> 04:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
inabilities to answer I don't feel too
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
bad um I have three concerns the first
 
04:14:38.630 --> 04:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
is on the line item issue on page two it
 
04:14:41.630 --> 04:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this line item now
 
04:14:45.149 --> 04:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
creates an o obligation for every school
 
04:14:48.670 --> 04:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
district in the state to be a sending
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
District because it says each School
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
District shall establish a lion
 
04:14:55.910 --> 04:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
reflecting their estimated expenditures
 
04:14:58.389 --> 04:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
representative fellow said you can't
 
04:15:00.750 --> 04:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
send any money if you don't have
 
04:15:03.109 --> 04:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
something already in that line item so
 
04:15:05.429 --> 04:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
this line item would require at least
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
$1 this means that the lawsuit that's
 
04:15:10.189 --> 04:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
before The Supreme Court now which is
 
04:15:12.990 --> 04:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
based on the question of does a sending
 
04:15:15.550 --> 04:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
District have to be an open enrollment
 
04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
District in order to be a sending
 
04:15:20.670 --> 04:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
District it would eliminate that lawsuit
 
04:15:22.309 --> 04:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
which might accomplish representative
 
04:15:23.990 --> 04:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
McGuire's question why by having a
 
04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
lawsuit but it would through law back
 
04:15:28.550 --> 04:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
door around the court case and say that
 
04:15:30.349 --> 04:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
every District in the state must be
 
04:15:30.359 --> 04:15:31.590 align:start position:0%
every District in the state must be
ascending

04:15:31.590 --> 04:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
ascending
 
04:15:33.710 --> 04:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
District so whether or not that's a good
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
idea or bad idea I think that that's the
 
04:15:38.990 --> 04:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
impact of page two line
 
04:15:41.790 --> 04:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
four um the second thing I had a concern
 
04:15:44.149 --> 04:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
about is the addition of the word open
 
04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment program which nobody has
 
04:15:49.149 --> 04:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
discussed yet but one of the things that
 
04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
concerns me is that uh with online
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
education that you could very well have
 
04:15:57.990 --> 04:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
a school that sets up itself as an
 
04:15:58.000 --> 04:15:59.630 align:start position:0%
a school that sets up itself as an
online

04:15:59.630 --> 04:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
online
 
04:16:03.229 --> 04:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
program we have vac in every single town
 
04:16:05.830 --> 04:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
in the state it's a great program what
 
04:16:07.309 --> 04:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
makes it so good is that there can only
 
04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
be so many students per teacher There's
 
04:16:12.349 --> 04:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
an actual teacher behind that wall um I
 
04:16:14.670 --> 04:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to litigate the prageru thing
 
04:16:15.990 --> 04:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
that we went through last year but just
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
to point out a comparison of three
 
04:16:19.229 --> 04:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
different scenarios you you passed the
 
04:16:20.710 --> 04:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
law that said every school has to have a
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
financial literacy course for half a
 
04:16:24.870 --> 04:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
credit at that time I went back and did
 
04:16:27.189 --> 04:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
research every school high school in the
 
04:16:29.070 --> 04:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
state has a financial literacy course
 
04:16:32.790 --> 04:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
now the typical course is about 75 hours
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
of classroom time with a teacher
 
04:16:37.750 --> 04:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
homework assignments and that sort of
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
thing the VX course which I couldn't get
 
04:16:42.070 --> 04:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
into because you have to pay money to
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
actually see the whole curriculum which
 
04:16:45.070 --> 04:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
you can see the outline of the course
 
04:16:47.630 --> 04:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
there was 18 lessons it would probably
 
04:16:49.109 --> 04:16:49.119 align:start position:0%
be about the same amount of time and
 
04:16:50.469 --> 04:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
there would be a person and there would
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
be homework assignment so whether you
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
went to your local high school and got
 
04:16:55.349 --> 04:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
it or you got it through VX it would be
 
04:16:56.389 --> 04:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
a reasonable
 
04:17:00.030 --> 04:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
alternative the Prager program was 15
 
04:17:03.149 --> 04:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
videos that were 5 minutes each so
 
04:17:06.670 --> 04:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
that's a total of 75 minutes and the
 
04:17:09.070 --> 04:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
test was 30 multiple choice questions at
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
the end of it so and that got approved
 
04:17:12.389 --> 04:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
by the State Board of Education so in
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
other words if in if your child doesn't
 
04:17:16.309 --> 04:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
want to go to your local high school and
 
04:17:18.750 --> 04:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
spend 75 hours on financial literacy
 
04:17:20.590 --> 04:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
with a classroom teacher and homework if
 
04:17:22.670 --> 04:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
you don't want to go to VX and spend 70
 
04:17:24.269 --> 04:17:24.279 align:start position:0%
hours with a real life teacher behind
 
04:17:26.510 --> 04:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
the wall and do all the homework you can
 
04:17:28.349 --> 04:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
just watch 75 minutes worth of videos
 
04:17:29.950 --> 04:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
and take a few multiple choice questions
 
04:17:31.710 --> 04:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
so now the the the rule has been
 
04:17:34.149 --> 04:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
established in the state that 75 hours
 
04:17:36.269 --> 04:17:36.279 align:start position:0%
can be replaced with 75 minutes so an
 
04:17:38.030 --> 04:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
hour in the classroom can be replaced
 
04:17:40.429 --> 04:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
with one minute of video if some school
 
04:17:43.229 --> 04:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
sets up an online video program you
 
04:17:46.389 --> 04:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
could basically just have a whole and
 
04:17:48.189 --> 04:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
they become somehow a
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
school it it opens up a door that I
 
04:17:52.550 --> 04:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't think we we really want to go to
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
you can have the kids stay in their
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
local school if they want to take a
 
04:17:56.710 --> 04:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
couple classes through V like if your
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
child wants European history your high
 
04:17:59.550 --> 04:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
school doesn't have it they can take
 
04:18:01.710 --> 04:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
that extra course through VX but this
 
04:18:03.149 --> 04:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
addition of the word program has not
 
04:18:04.469 --> 04:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
been Justified there's been no
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
explanation of what it's here for what
 
04:18:08.070 --> 04:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
it could do but I do see potential
 
04:18:10.389 --> 04:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
problems with it and the third concern
 
04:18:11.630 --> 04:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
I've got is just with the Open
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
Enrollment notion in general I I I think
 
04:18:15.630 --> 04:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
it's great that children should have
 
04:18:17.710 --> 04:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
choice but I think there should only be
 
04:18:19.910 --> 04:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
choice if every child also has a chance
 
04:18:22.070 --> 04:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
to get a good education until as a state
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
we provide a chance for every child I
 
04:18:26.189 --> 04:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
don't think we want to expand the choice
 
04:18:28.269 --> 04:18:28.279 align:start position:0%
opportunities what makes New Hampshire
 
04:18:30.149 --> 04:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
unique in the financial sector is that
 
04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
we are last in state spending in the
 
04:18:34.750 --> 04:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
United States now Michigan I was just
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
listening to a man from Michigan give a
 
04:18:39.030 --> 04:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
talk about their open enrollment program
 
04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
out there and and he pointed out that
 
04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much out there all the schools
 
04:18:45.469 --> 04:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
well funded and the US Census Data I
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it into you shows the federal
 
04:18:49.790 --> 04:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
state and local sources for each state
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
in America in Michigan they pay 55% in
 
04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we pay 27% this is the
 
04:18:57.990 --> 04:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
latest from the US Census they're paying
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
twice as much from the state that means
 
04:19:02.189 --> 04:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
that every single school out there every
 
04:19:04.229 --> 04:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
child's got a reasonable chance in New
 
04:19:06.510 --> 04:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you have huge disparities in
 
04:19:08.590 --> 04:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
spending between town that results in
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
huge disparities in proficiency between
 
04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
town just to give you some examples I
 
04:19:14.109 --> 04:19:14.119 align:start position:0%
know there there's some legislators here
 
04:19:16.469 --> 04:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
who have Newport and Charlestown in your
 
04:19:18.750 --> 04:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
District those schools have 10%
 
04:19:20.550 --> 04:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
proficiency that means out of levels 1 2
 
04:19:22.590 --> 04:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
3 and four levels three and four is
 
04:19:25.710 --> 04:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
proficient 10% are proficient Bedford on
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
the other hand is 69 hopkington is 61
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
conquer is 54 my hometown aware is 22%
 
04:19:34.229 --> 04:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
when you have more money you get higher
 
04:19:35.710 --> 04:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
proficiency when you have less you get
 
04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
lower proficiency so I think until we
 
04:19:39.950 --> 04:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
actually spend money and make sure that
 
04:19:41.710 --> 04:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
every child has a chance to get a good
 
04:19:44.349 --> 04:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
education it's would be inappropriate
 
04:19:46.990 --> 04:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
for the state to expand Choice programs
 
04:19:48.590 --> 04:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
which will exacerbate the differences
 
04:19:50.910 --> 04:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
between the Haves and Have Nots you look
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
at this here and it would be available
 
04:19:57.870 --> 04:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
if if a parent wants to exp make no if
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
you make every school in the state be
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
open enrollment if basically this this
 
04:20:04.269 --> 04:20:04.279 align:start position:0%
this this law would create Statewide
 
04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
open enrollment those who can afford to
 
04:20:08.070 --> 04:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
transport their child to another
 
04:20:09.510 --> 04:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
District would automatically have a
 
04:20:11.149 --> 04:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
right to go there so if you're in
 
04:20:12.910 --> 04:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
Newport and you want your child to go to
 
04:20:15.269 --> 04:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
cipy which is just next door New London
 
04:20:16.990 --> 04:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
which is really next door in the other
 
04:20:18.670 --> 04:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
direction or you're in Charles toown and
 
04:20:20.710 --> 04:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
you want to go to one of these towns or
 
04:20:23.189 --> 04:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
Claremont you could easily make that
 
04:20:25.309 --> 04:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
happen under this statute but what that
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
does is it creates the difference we
 
04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
have between the halves and half not as
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
unconscionable right now this would
 
04:20:33.269 --> 04:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
exacerbate that difference difference
 
04:20:35.910 --> 04:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
first let's fund every school give every
 
04:20:37.469 --> 04:20:37.479 align:start position:0%
child in the state a fair chance and
 
04:20:38.990 --> 04:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
then you probably won't need to have a
 
04:20:40.429 --> 04:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
lot of people who want to go open
 
04:20:42.189 --> 04:20:42.199 align:start position:0%
enrollment because their Hometown school
 
04:20:44.830 --> 04:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
would be adequate this just exacerbates
 
04:20:46.710 --> 04:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
an existing problem and I'm sorry one
 
04:20:48.910 --> 04:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
more thing which is all the other
 
04:20:50.670 --> 04:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
options in the status quo that exists
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
like Mr lad representative lad said you
 
04:20:56.389 --> 04:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
have CTE that are different one town is
 
04:20:58.670 --> 04:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
the Alvine is the agricultural School
 
04:21:00.910 --> 04:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
other town is the automotive School you
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
that already exists in the Pres system
 
04:21:04.030 --> 04:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
if you have a problem you can go through
 
04:21:06.269 --> 04:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
manifest hardship if you have a problem
 
04:21:07.830 --> 04:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
you can get your child tuition to
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
another school if both sides agree to it
 
04:21:11.950 --> 04:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
you can solve these problems right now
 
04:21:14.189 --> 04:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
we with the voluntary open enrollment
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
system this bill I think on page two
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
would make it mandatory that every
 
04:21:21.630 --> 04:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
school in the state become an open
 
04:21:24.630 --> 04:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
enrollment school both ways or certainly
 
04:21:26.910 --> 04:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
at least sending thank
 
04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:34.109 --> 04:21:34.119 align:start position:0%
questions okay see none thank you very
 
04:21:35.149 --> 04:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:54.590 --> 04:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
sorry about
 
04:21:56.790 --> 04:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
that my name is Timothy Robinson I'm a
 
04:21:59.389 --> 04:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
resident of Pittsfield um I'm on the
 
04:22:00.630 --> 04:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield school board I am not
 
04:22:01.870 --> 04:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
representing the school board of the seu
 
04:22:04.229 --> 04:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
I'm representing myself uh just so we're
 
04:22:07.229 --> 04:22:07.239 align:start position:0%
aware that affiliation wise um I have
 
04:22:10.790 --> 04:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
lots of concerns about uh RSA 194d
 
04:22:12.750 --> 04:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
obviously Pittsfield is a party to
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on Supreme Court um I will
 
04:22:17.870 --> 04:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
say that the concept or the vision of
 
04:22:20.030 --> 04:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
school choice is a great idea right so
 
04:22:22.030 --> 04:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
that if it was a a school that was more
 
04:22:23.309 --> 04:22:23.319 align:start position:0%
centered on music a kid could go there
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
if there was more centered on History
 
04:22:28.109 --> 04:22:28.119 align:start position:0%
the kid could go there great concept the
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
the the mapping of how we get from here
 
04:22:35.950 --> 04:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
to there under RSA 9 194 is not fair to
 
04:22:38.030 --> 04:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and it's not fair to the
 
04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
people that with the amount of money
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
that local money that's spent on school
 
04:22:43.910 --> 04:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
budgets it it's not fair to them it's
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
always the devil's always in the details
 
04:22:47.429 --> 04:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
right so the details here on what's
 
04:22:50.309 --> 04:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
being presented here is it's almost the
 
04:22:52.309 --> 04:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
as with what has happened with the
 
04:22:54.349 --> 04:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
opinion from the doe where certain
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
language was cherry-picked in my opinion
 
04:23:00.550 --> 04:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
um and it was excised out of if you read
 
04:23:01.910 --> 04:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
the three words before it would change
 
04:23:03.389 --> 04:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
the meaning that's what I mean it was
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
Cherry Picked in their decision um again
 
04:23:10.469 --> 04:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
my opinion not anybody else's said to
 
04:23:12.870 --> 04:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
create an environment where you were
 
04:23:15.790 --> 04:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
forcing sending districts to pay money
 
04:23:19.950 --> 04:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh the language in this proposed uh in
 
04:23:21.429 --> 04:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
771 um kind of only reinforces that so
 
04:23:29.309 --> 04:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
if you go down to on 194 D colon 5 uh
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
section one uh with with the addition of
 
04:23:34.510 --> 04:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
the word receiving School uh that
 
04:23:39.630 --> 04:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't that it kind of requires the uh
 
04:23:41.590 --> 04:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
the sending school and this receiving
 
04:23:43.469 --> 04:23:43.479 align:start position:0%
school it requires sending District to
 
04:23:46.429 --> 04:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
have to actually pay there's no you know
 
04:23:47.790 --> 04:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's other language in the
 
04:23:51.189 --> 04:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
RSA that talks about adoption of the the
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and that that has never
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
occurred in Pittsfield nobody's ever
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
voted to send students outside of the
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
district even though we've been sent a
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill to pay for and that's why we're
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
where we're at um to get to an open
 
04:24:09.670 --> 04:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment school but the the the voters
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
and the taxpayers in Pittsfield have
 
04:24:12.670 --> 04:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
never discussed this and never voted on
 
04:24:15.109 --> 04:24:15.119 align:start position:0%
it but um we got a state agency that's
 
04:24:16.710 --> 04:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
essentially requiring us you know under
 
04:24:19.389 --> 04:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
their opinion to pay for tuition for
 
04:24:21.429 --> 04:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
student that the the taxpayers voters of
 
04:24:23.670 --> 04:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield never voted to do it's a
 
04:24:27.510 --> 04:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
program that that does that uh I have if
 
04:24:31.229 --> 04:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
I if more of this was the pass uh the
 
04:24:33.750 --> 04:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
language 80% of the sending districts
 
04:24:36.429 --> 04:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
average um I understand you know that's
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
if we had a really high T you tuition
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
that they would get up to 80% of that if
 
04:24:42.910 --> 04:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
their tuition was that there's no cap on
 
04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
it what on the TW on the receiving
 
04:24:47.149 --> 04:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
schools tuition in proportion to the
 
04:24:50.830 --> 04:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
sending schools uh per student cost if
 
04:24:51.990 --> 04:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to do one I think you got
 
04:24:54.109 --> 04:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
to do both right I'm not even I don't
 
04:24:55.269 --> 04:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
support the legislation but if you're
 
04:24:56.550 --> 04:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
going to look at this legislation and
 
04:24:58.590 --> 04:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to do this we have to do
 
04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
the the the sending District you know
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
some some there has to be some cost
 
04:25:06.189 --> 04:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
control and some some ability to to cap
 
04:25:09.389 --> 04:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
that on on that and I know won't be 100%
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
you know because it's some some of these
 
04:25:13.550 --> 04:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
programs might be way more expensive but
 
04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
it has to be capped in some kind of per
 
04:25:17.309 --> 04:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
way way that's in line with what the
 
04:25:19.030 --> 04:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
average cost per student is at the at
 
04:25:23.670 --> 04:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
the at the district um I I just when
 
04:25:25.030 --> 04:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
when this happened in Pittsfield as a
 
04:25:27.429 --> 04:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
resident Pittsfield I I felt that this
 
04:25:30.109 --> 04:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
is like a slippery slope right so the
 
04:25:32.309 --> 04:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
way this happened you know member of the
 
04:25:33.429 --> 04:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
community decid to send their kids to
 
04:25:34.750 --> 04:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
another school which is you know that
 
04:25:36.830 --> 04:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
that can happen in in everywhere else it
 
04:25:38.710 --> 04:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
kind of happens they pay the they pay
 
04:25:39.950 --> 04:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
the twit themselves right you know
 
04:25:42.389 --> 04:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
currently if if they're not part of this
 
04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
enrollment program there's near no
 
04:25:48.830 --> 04:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
difference than if I called uh a private
 
04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
Paving Company and asked them to PVE in
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
front of my house and told them to send
 
04:25:54.990 --> 04:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
the bill to town of Pittsfield in
 
04:25:56.750 --> 04:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
reality there's no difference that's
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what happened on this this just
 
04:26:00.950 --> 04:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
happen to be uh a student going to a
 
04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
different school you know and the town's
 
04:26:05.830 --> 04:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
been asked to or the the taxpayers has
 
04:26:08.469 --> 04:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
been asked to pay for it so I feel like
 
04:26:10.830 --> 04:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
it just opens up this really weird
 
04:26:13.389 --> 04:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
environment where those of us who are
 
04:26:15.469 --> 04:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
paying local property taxes don't have
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
control over the expenses and I think
 
04:26:20.510 --> 04:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know having been on the board I mean
 
04:26:22.910 --> 04:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
trust me there's a lot
 
04:26:25.910 --> 04:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
more um transparency with people looking
 
04:26:27.710 --> 04:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
at even to how much we spend on copy
 
04:26:29.389 --> 04:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
paper you know at the local school
 
04:26:32.550 --> 04:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
district you know in as opposed to just
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
getting a tuition bill from another
 
04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
school so we the the the people who in
 
04:26:38.469 --> 04:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
the receive in the sending district will
 
04:26:41.349 --> 04:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
lose that Fidelity and the ability to
 
04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
cap those costs
 
04:26:44.070 --> 04:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know whether the costs are
 
04:26:45.990 --> 04:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable or not it would also lose the
 
04:26:48.149 --> 04:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
ability to change out the elected
 
04:26:49.710 --> 04:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
representatives on the board if they
 
04:26:50.830 --> 04:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
don't like the direction the school's
 
04:26:52.790 --> 04:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
going and there's a lot you know in the
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
local school district now that you have
 
04:26:55.550 --> 04:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to change out the board
 
04:26:57.109 --> 04:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
members if you don't like it who then
 
04:26:59.309 --> 04:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
can maybe you know set new policy and
 
04:27:01.389 --> 04:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
direction for that school district if we
 
04:27:03.349 --> 04:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
get forced to start paying tuition to to
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
to schools that we don't have any
 
04:27:07.229 --> 04:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
control over we lose control over that
 
04:27:12.189 --> 04:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:13.990 --> 04:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
town the individual choices they make
 
04:27:16.670 --> 04:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
and we get stuck with the bill and we
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
have no ability to to have any kind of
 
04:27:22.109 --> 04:27:22.119 align:start position:0%
say on that bill other than requir the
 
04:27:23.309 --> 04:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
way this legislation is currently
 
04:27:25.590 --> 04:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
written to just pay the bill and I don't
 
04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
think that's fair to the taxpayers in
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
any District in the in the state I I you
 
04:27:32.630 --> 04:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
know I'm only speaking from my view from
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield obviously you know we're a
 
04:27:37.389 --> 04:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
very small school and losing money out
 
04:27:39.309 --> 04:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
of the district is is a probably a
 
04:27:40.670 --> 04:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
larger impact than this to some of the
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
bigger districts in in the state
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
but it still we still lose that kind of
 
04:27:47.630 --> 04:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
concept of the New England town meeting
 
04:27:51.030 --> 04:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
local control um the with this
 
04:27:53.389 --> 04:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
particular legislation the way it is uh
 
04:27:55.389 --> 04:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
open up to any questions from from
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%

04:27:58.870 --> 04:27:58.880 align:start position:0%

04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%

300% of federal poverty guidelines
 
04:32:02.950 --> 04:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
feating more kids at school is at the
 
04:32:05.149 --> 04:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
heart of this legislation we have too
 
04:32:07.309 --> 04:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
many kids who go to school hungry with
 
04:32:10.469 --> 04:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
minimal or little access to food most of
 
04:32:12.670 --> 04:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
us don't like to go hungry yesterday the
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
snow storm was brewing folks were
 
04:32:16.349 --> 04:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
anxious about their commute we could
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
have worked our way through the
 
04:32:19.309 --> 04:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
remaining bills and gotten out maybe at
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
1:30 but we stopped for a lunch break
 
04:32:23.790 --> 04:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
because folks were hungry some kids
 
04:32:26.550 --> 04:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
don't have that luxury to just go just
 
04:32:29.109 --> 04:32:29.119 align:start position:0%
go eat when they're hungry in the fall
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
of 2023 a study commission a study
 
04:32:34.950 --> 04:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
committee was established it had three
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
Senators three Representatives four of
 
04:32:39.870 --> 04:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
those Republicans and two Democrats two
 
04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
of you or one of you in this room right
 
04:32:44.189 --> 04:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
now on that committee one of the tasks
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
of that statutory committee was
 
04:32:48.389 --> 04:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
determine if the income eligibility
 
04:32:51.030 --> 04:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
relative to free School meals should be
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
expanded the final report submitted by
 
04:32:55.830 --> 04:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
the Republican chair of the committee
 
04:32:58.950 --> 04:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
noted that one the majority of the
 
04:33:00.670 --> 04:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
committee recommended that a bill should
 
04:33:03.550 --> 04:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
be filed this term to increase free and
 
04:33:05.949 --> 04:33:05.959 align:start position:0%
reduced eligible eligible students from
 
04:33:10.269 --> 04:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
185 to 200% of poverty the minority
 
04:33:12.269 --> 04:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
recommended the increase be three 100%
 
04:33:14.189 --> 04:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
of poverty which is reflected in this
 
04:33:16.029 --> 04:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
bill that I'm introducing
 
04:33:19.750 --> 04:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
today the majority report regarding that
 
04:33:22.830 --> 04:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility expansion to 200% stated
 
04:33:24.990 --> 04:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
that it was crystal clear in the
 
04:33:26.670 --> 04:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
committee that the cost of the current
 
04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
High inflation is hitting low-income
 
04:33:31.269 --> 04:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
families the hardest and increasing food
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
insecurity in many of our citizens homes
 
04:33:36.269 --> 04:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
current eligibility leaves a large
 
04:33:38.109 --> 04:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
portion of students who are financially
 
04:33:41.470 --> 04:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
V vulnerable without access to meals
 
04:33:43.789 --> 04:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
this recommended incremental change to
 
04:33:46.189 --> 04:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
cover the cost for food only would go a
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
long way to improving the educational
 
04:33:50.429 --> 04:33:50.439 align:start position:0%
setting so that no student is sitting at
 
04:33:53.551 --> 04:33:53.561 align:start position:0%
a desk trying to learn while hungry
 
04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
again that was a majority report The
 
04:33:59.390 --> 04:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
Minority Report noted that 300% increase
 
04:34:01.109 --> 04:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
would ensure that more children have
 
04:34:02.709 --> 04:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
access to the nutrition that they need
 
04:34:05.349 --> 04:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
to reach their full potential access to
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
nutritious meals improve student health
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
mental and physical and the increase
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
would provide greatest stability for
 
04:34:14.629 --> 04:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
those in need allowing them to focus
 
04:34:16.470 --> 04:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
more on their studies and less on
 
04:34:17.910 --> 04:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
worrying about where their next meal
 
04:34:20.629 --> 04:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
would come from it's important to note
 
04:34:22.949 --> 04:34:22.959 align:start position:0%
that this bipartisan committee as a
 
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
whole agreed that the income eligibility
 
04:34:28.349 --> 04:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
relative to free School meals should be
 
04:34:30.590 --> 04:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
expanded I hope we can all agree that
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
food is essential to learning and that
 
04:34:33.830 --> 04:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
all students deserve an equal
 
04:34:36.029 --> 04:34:36.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn and that food
 
04:34:37.949 --> 04:34:37.959 align:start position:0%
insecurity puts tremendous stress on
 
04:34:40.150 --> 04:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
families who are struggling to hit their
 
04:34:42.150 --> 04:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
basic needs budgets given the increased
 
04:34:44.429 --> 04:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
cost of food as well as Child Care
 
04:34:46.510 --> 04:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
Health Care Transportation housing
 
04:34:48.590 --> 04:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
utilities you know a lot you know we
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about the price of eggs I
 
04:34:52.029 --> 04:34:52.039 align:start position:0%
bought a dozen eggs the other day for
 
04:34:55.269 --> 04:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
$6.99 and they weren't cagefree our
 
04:34:56.750 --> 04:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
neighbors of Maine Vermont and
 
04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts have all implemented
 
04:35:01.709 --> 04:35:01.719 align:start position:0%
healthy School meals for
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
all according to the doe fiscal note
 
04:35:06.029 --> 04:35:06.039 align:start position:0%
this bill would ensure that half of our
 
04:35:08.949 --> 04:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
student population the more vulnerable
 
04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
population had access to school meals
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
um and with that I'll take questions
 
04:35:16.709 --> 04:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
knowing the folks behind me I'll be more
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
equipped to answer them especially
 
04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
questions about the financial input
 
04:35:22.750 --> 04:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
please vote art to pass on House Bill
 
04:35:25.310 --> 04:35:25.320 align:start position:0%

04:35:35.429 --> 04:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
question not so much for representative
 
04:35:38.429 --> 04:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%

04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
you think we could get some copies of
 
04:36:13.470 --> 04:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
that M Jennifer it's right here
 
04:36:15.510 --> 04:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't have it Tony did I really
 
04:36:17.789 --> 04:36:17.799 align:start position:0%
didn't have
 
04:36:20.429 --> 04:36:20.439 align:start position:0%
it thank you any further questions for
 
04:36:22.551 --> 04:36:22.561 align:start position:0%
representative Hall yes representative
 
04:36:24.789 --> 04:36:24.799 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:36:26.670 --> 04:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
04:36:29.429 --> 04:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
this bill affects those whose household
 
04:36:32.349 --> 04:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
income is between 185% and
 
04:36:36.029 --> 04:36:36.039 align:start position:0%
300% of federal poverty guidelines what
 
04:36:39.390 --> 04:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
fraction of children in that from those
 
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
households are malnourished and what
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
would be the source of that
 
04:36:47.590 --> 04:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
data I would thank you for your question
 
04:36:49.590 --> 04:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
I would refer that to hunger solutions
 
04:36:50.830 --> 04:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
they would be better to answer that
 
04:36:53.910 --> 04:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
question in terms of the data thank you
 
04:36:55.869 --> 04:36:55.879 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
04:36:58.230 --> 04:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
represent spillsbury then representative
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
papovich so in line 16 it says the
 
04:37:03.869 --> 04:37:03.879 align:start position:0%
amount necessary to fund this paragraph
 
04:37:06.150 --> 04:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
is hereby appropriated I don't think we
 
04:37:10.150 --> 04:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
normally just appropriate whatever it
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
costs is the is there an estimate and a
 
04:37:14.949 --> 04:37:14.959 align:start position:0%
figure that you would like to see
 
04:37:17.310 --> 04:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
appropriated would be the cost whatever
 
04:37:19.390 --> 04:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
it costs whatever it
 
04:37:23.830 --> 04:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
costs okay represent papovich thank you
 
04:37:25.390 --> 04:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for introducing
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
the bill and testifying you stated in
 
04:37:30.310 --> 04:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony that this money is only
 
04:37:32.429 --> 04:37:32.439 align:start position:0%
to feed the kids are you saying that the
 
04:37:32.439 --> 04:37:33.349 align:start position:0%
to feed the kids are you saying that the
legal

04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
legal
 
04:37:36.349 --> 04:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
language removes the connection between
 
04:37:39.029 --> 04:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
the uh free and elig students eligible
 
04:37:40.949 --> 04:37:40.959 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced meals and the
 
04:37:42.910 --> 04:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
school fund funding in the left side of
 
04:37:44.670 --> 04:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
the funding
 
04:37:46.670 --> 04:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
formula would you ask that question
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
again sure you testified that the only
 
04:37:50.590 --> 04:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
money this bill is asking for is the
 
04:37:52.949 --> 04:37:52.959 align:start position:0%
money needed to feed the children I'm
 
04:37:54.510 --> 04:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
asking you whether the language
 
04:37:56.510 --> 04:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
specifically removes the connection
 
04:37:58.990 --> 04:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
between the number of kids that are
 
04:38:02.070 --> 04:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
eligible for free and reduced meals and
 
04:38:04.070 --> 04:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
the additional school funding for
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
Education we provide in the left side of
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
the funding formula yeah I I'm going to
 
04:38:11.510 --> 04:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
let someone else answer that question
 
04:38:14.750 --> 04:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
04:38:18.029 --> 04:38:18.039 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing thank you very much
 
04:38:29.349 --> 04:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:31.590 --> 04:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
Horgan I'm representing Timothy Oregon
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
for straford County District 10 the town
 
04:38:36.750 --> 04:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
of Durham and um so I support this bill
 
04:38:38.830 --> 04:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
I've uh co-sponsored or sponsored
 
04:38:40.869 --> 04:38:40.879 align:start position:0%
similar bills in the past um in this
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
case this case they ran out of room on
 
04:38:45.029 --> 04:38:45.039 align:start position:0%
the Mast head so I was eager to be on it
 
04:38:47.310 --> 04:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
myself but I let others be on it and I
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
just say I support this bill um and I
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
was glad you had the discussion about
 
04:38:54.109 --> 04:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal note because the copy
 
04:38:56.109 --> 04:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
that I grabbed that's on the table the
 
04:38:58.150 --> 04:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education hadn't provided
 
04:39:00.349 --> 04:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note yet but um that was just
 
04:39:03.629 --> 04:39:03.639 align:start position:0%
11025 but the updated one is on the
 
04:39:06.390 --> 04:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
website and so so I have a little bit
 
04:39:08.390 --> 04:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
more you know I was about to make a
 
04:39:09.990 --> 04:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
cynical comment about why they didn't
 
04:39:11.789 --> 04:39:11.799 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note but they did a good
 
04:39:14.470 --> 04:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note so the bill that's before
 
04:39:16.629 --> 04:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
you I guess they say it would cost about
 
04:39:19.510 --> 04:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
48 million that's uh for feeding
 
04:39:21.070 --> 04:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
children I think that's a very good
 
04:39:25.310 --> 04:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
cause and it uh it saves the and it
 
04:39:28.750 --> 04:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
saves the uh the parents of the kids uh
 
04:39:31.269 --> 04:39:31.279 align:start position:0%
48 collectively 48 million because they
 
04:39:32.949 --> 04:39:32.959 align:start position:0%
or probably more than 48 million because
 
04:39:35.070 --> 04:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
reduces the transaction cost of
 
04:39:37.628 --> 04:39:37.638 align:start position:0%
collecting of uh of paying for those
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
meals that's money it goes back in the
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
pockets of working young Working
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
Families and that's I think that's a
 
04:39:43.990 --> 04:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
good thing that's a very good investment
 
04:39:45.868 --> 04:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
48 million and
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
um looks like uh if you want to go even
 
04:39:51.150 --> 04:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
further if you want to give every sounds
 
04:39:54.270 --> 04:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
like uh if you take that 48 million that
 
04:39:55.990 --> 04:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
would applied about 50% of the school
 
04:39:58.110 --> 04:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
population so we double that it's 96
 
04:40:00.990 --> 04:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
million so that's uh maybe not in this
 
04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
particular budget cycle but I think
 
04:40:05.550 --> 04:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
that's a that's probably an achievable
 
04:40:07.470 --> 04:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
goal especially given that it say you're
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
feeding children and you're also uh
 
04:40:13.670 --> 04:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
freeing up that money for uh for use by
 
04:40:15.190 --> 04:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
the the growing families that those
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
children belong to and I might also
 
04:40:18.670 --> 04:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
point out that like no matter how
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
affluent the parents may or may not be
 
04:40:23.708 --> 04:40:23.718 align:start position:0%
school children are children so they
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
basically don't have any most of them
 
04:40:27.150 --> 04:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any money of their own unless
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
you're like the 12-year-old kid who
 
04:40:31.030 --> 04:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
shovels out my driveway who makes $40
 
04:40:33.230 --> 04:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
per snowstorm but he he's he's a very
 
04:40:36.190 --> 04:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
rare rare kid most kids do not have any
 
04:40:37.708 --> 04:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
money of their own so they you know
 
04:40:39.550 --> 04:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of the congressman he said he
 
04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
had a job and worked his way through
 
04:40:43.030 --> 04:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
High School well that's U that's now how
 
04:40:45.750 --> 04:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
it how it is for for the vast majority
 
04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
of kids they don't have any money even
 
04:40:48.868 --> 04:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
the ones who are working are saving up
 
04:40:50.910 --> 04:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
to go to college or do other things in
 
04:40:53.390 --> 04:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
our later life so I would just I would
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
just say this is a good bill even with
 
04:40:57.750 --> 04:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
the budget circumstances we can afford
 
04:41:01.030 --> 04:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
it and uh we should pass it and also
 
04:41:02.948 --> 04:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
emphasize another question the way this
 
04:41:04.430 --> 04:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
is written it doesn't affect the whole
 
04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
distinction between free and reduced uh
 
04:41:10.590 --> 04:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
families for uh which is deeply embedded
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
in our school funding system and maybe
 
04:41:14.750 --> 04:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
our school funding system doesn't work
 
04:41:16.150 --> 04:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
but you won't be able to change it
 
04:41:18.070 --> 04:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
between now and uh now and the end of
 
04:41:19.670 --> 04:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
this session so we may as well stick
 
04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
with the framework we have so so please
 
04:41:25.070 --> 04:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
pass this bill and if anything I'd be
 
04:41:26.910 --> 04:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
happy if you made it even more inclusive
 
04:41:29.788 --> 04:41:29.798 align:start position:0%
so thanks thank you very much are there

families just above the income
 
04:43:20.670 --> 04:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
eligibility threshold that come to

prices and other costs of living
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
expenses there's also the issue of
 
04:43:35.310 --> 04:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
unpaid School Meal debt causing a
 
04:43:36.910 --> 04:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
financial strain on local school
 
04:43:39.270 --> 04:43:39.280 align:start position:0%

04:43:48.110 --> 04:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
and moderate income families this will
 
04:43:50.550 --> 04:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
eliminate the reduced price category
 
04:43:52.590 --> 04:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
greatly reduces if not eliminates the
 
04:43:54.110 --> 04:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
problem of school meal debt and
 
04:43:56.990 --> 04:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
streamlines the school um Food Service
 
04:44:00.670 --> 04:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
program I have um cited um some studies
 
04:44:04.030 --> 04:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
and reports in my uh my testimony um you
 
04:44:06.350 --> 04:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
know to combat food insecurity one of
 
04:44:08.910 --> 04:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
the very important benefits of this bill
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
it was found food insufficiency dropped
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
by 14% among students who participate in
 
04:44:15.788 --> 04:44:15.798 align:start position:0%
the national school lunch program
 
04:44:17.150 --> 04:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
students from food insecure and
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
marginally secure households get more of
 
04:44:21.110 --> 04:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
their food and nutrients from school
 
04:44:23.788 --> 04:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
meals than other students it promotes
 
04:44:25.830 --> 04:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
good nutrition students who eat school
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
lunches tend to take in more whole
 
04:44:29.470 --> 04:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
grains vegetables and dairy and fewer
 
04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
refined sugars and empty caral calories
 
04:44:35.230 --> 04:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
ensuring academic success students who
 
04:44:37.030 --> 04:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
have nutritious diets tend to perform
 
04:44:39.948 --> 04:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
better and pay more attention in school
 
04:44:41.590 --> 04:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
and strengthening School budgets
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
increased access to free meals will
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate unpaid School Meal debt which
 
04:44:47.670 --> 04:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
is an issue that's been a subject of
 
04:44:49.788 --> 04:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
another bill um that's come before the
 
04:44:54.510 --> 04:44:54.520 align:start position:0%

for taking my question um I'm looking at
 
04:46:27.548 --> 04:46:27.558 align:start position:0%
a at a random uh menu here from a school
 
04:46:30.150 --> 04:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
do you think that providing our kids
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
with cinnamon roll for breakfast is a
 
04:46:35.350 --> 04:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
heart healthy breakfast or in today's
 
04:46:37.868 --> 04:46:37.878 align:start position:0%
breakfast it was a whole grain baked dut
 
04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
is that a heart healthy breakfast that
 
04:46:41.350 --> 04:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
our kids should be eating before they're
 
04:46:44.510 --> 04:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
being educated I I do have to say that I
 
04:46:48.310 --> 04:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
am not a nutritionist um and um I'm not
 
04:46:50.510 --> 04:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
sure which school it is um and whether
 
04:46:53.350 --> 04:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
they're part of the um USDA um School
 
04:46:55.590 --> 04:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
meals program but they do need to follow
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
guidelines so I don't know what is in
 
04:47:01.670 --> 04:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
the um in the uh the recipe for those
 
04:47:04.070 --> 04:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
items but it may as long as it's in line
 
04:47:06.310 --> 04:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
with the uh the fats and sugars and
 
04:47:08.708 --> 04:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
sodiums that are recommended for young
 
04:47:11.948 --> 04:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
children then yes it's
 
04:47:15.390 --> 04:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:47:15.400 --> 04:47:17.190 align:start position:0%

04:47:28.310 --> 04:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
nutritionist um let's not let's just ask
 
04:47:31.590 --> 04:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
questions if you have a question ask a
 
04:47:33.990 --> 04:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
question so Miss
 
04:47:37.110 --> 04:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
B would you be able to
 
04:47:37.120 --> 04:47:39.350 align:start position:0%
B would you be able to
confirm

04:47:39.350 --> 04:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
confirm
 
04:47:41.948 --> 04:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
that would you be able ble to confirm
 
04:47:45.150 --> 04:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
that the school lunch program well two
 
04:47:47.110 --> 04:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
parts so that most New Hampshire schools
 
04:47:48.708 --> 04:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
do participate in the federal school
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
lunch program yes and so if
 
04:47:56.510 --> 04:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
we um
 
04:47:59.628 --> 04:47:59.638 align:start position:0%
believe that school referenced is part
 
04:48:00.750 --> 04:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
of that
 
04:48:03.150 --> 04:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
program thank
 
04:48:05.830 --> 04:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
you would you be able to confirm that
 
04:48:07.708 --> 04:48:07.718 align:start position:0%
the federal standards for the school
 
04:48:11.230 --> 04:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
lunch program are very specific to the
 
04:48:14.670 --> 04:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
nutrition composition of foods such that
 
04:48:18.030 --> 04:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
a for instance cinnamon roll is probably
 
04:48:20.350 --> 04:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
a much much healthier food than what all
 
04:48:22.910 --> 04:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
of us are salivating for right now or
 
04:48:25.788 --> 04:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
many of us as in less fat more whole
 
04:48:29.190 --> 04:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
grain less sugar Etc to the best of my
 
04:48:31.230 --> 04:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
limited abilities as as a non-
 
04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
nutritionist I would agree with you that
 
04:48:36.750 --> 04:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
the US um da um food standards need to
 
04:48:39.910 --> 04:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
be in line with um with what is um
 
04:48:43.830 --> 04:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
developed for for the health of
 
04:48:47.070 --> 04:48:47.080 align:start position:0%

was established that I was a member of
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate since that
 
04:49:10.910 --> 04:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee was mentioned for me to

cor thank you chairman lad goodon riona
 
04:49:37.510 --> 04:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
core New Hampshire hunger Solutions I
 
04:49:39.070 --> 04:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
actually have a Bachelor of Science I am
 
04:49:40.750 --> 04:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
a clinic nutritionist as well for the
 
04:49:43.070 --> 04:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
last 10 to 15 years I worked in the wick
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
may I adjust the questions to previously
 
04:49:47.190 --> 04:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
that there was no answers to you you
 
04:49:50.030 --> 04:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
have four right now so so the cinnamon
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
rolls that you did State they are 50% or
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
more whole grains they are either with
 
04:49:57.230 --> 04:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
the food Management program and they're
 
04:49:59.390 --> 04:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
very strict on those vitamins and
 
04:50:01.030 --> 04:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
minerals that are fortified with they're
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
actually iron rich with and with the
 
04:50:04.708 --> 04:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
same brand of the cine minis
 
04:50:06.548 --> 04:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
specifically that are bought in Hanford
 
04:50:08.830 --> 04:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
Shaw's Walmart you cannot buy these in
 
04:50:11.150 --> 04:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
the store so even if it is Pillsbury
 
04:50:13.110 --> 04:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
they are 50% or more with vitamin
 
04:50:14.750 --> 04:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
enriched there's a little bit of more
 
04:50:17.708 --> 04:50:17.718 align:start position:0%
protein and iron and and less sodium as
 
04:50:21.110 --> 04:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
well and representative uh
 
04:50:24.230 --> 04:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
papichi you did mention about the uh
 
04:50:26.350 --> 04:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
funding formula the funding formula will
 
04:50:28.750 --> 04:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
not be changed for this because they use
 
04:50:31.590 --> 04:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
the federal um guidelines so I do want
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
to State those prior so thank you so my

work I work with schools directly across
 
04:50:46.390 --> 04:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire I did State
 
04:50:48.030 --> 04:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
previously in this committee 40 schools
 
04:50:49.590 --> 04:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
I signed on two more schools after
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
testifying last week so I have 42
 
04:50:53.310 --> 04:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
schools that I work with directly Food
 
04:50:55.390 --> 04:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
Service Management Programs as well I
 
04:50:57.868 --> 04:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
work with business administrators my
 
04:50:59.750 --> 04:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
main goal with the schools is to
 
04:51:00.990 --> 04:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
increase the free and reduce
 
04:51:03.510 --> 04:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
applications increase snap enrollment
 
04:51:05.708 --> 04:51:05.718 align:start position:0%
and try to get the school budgets um
 
04:51:05.718 --> 04:51:06.948 align:start position:0%
and try to get the school budgets um
appropriate

04:51:06.948 --> 04:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:51:09.708 --> 04:51:09.718 align:start position:0%
within the schools themselves by doing
 
04:51:12.910 --> 04:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
that we like to increase the breakfast
 
04:51:15.868 --> 04:51:15.878 align:start position:0%
participation in September 2024 the US
 
04:51:18.750 --> 04:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
Census stated in New Hampshire 39% of
 
04:51:20.310 --> 04:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
children lived in households reporting
 
04:51:22.628 --> 04:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
not having enough food the New Hampshire
 
04:51:24.548 --> 04:51:24.558 align:start position:0%
Food Bank testified on this committee
 
04:51:26.548 --> 04:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
last week that they distributed an
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
increase of a million pounds of food
 
04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
over 17 million pounds and it was still
 
04:51:33.110 --> 04:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
not enough to meet the New Hampshire's
 
04:51:35.390 --> 04:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
needs when we think of individuals in
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire receiving food charitable
 
04:51:39.230 --> 04:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
sites help
 
04:51:43.110 --> 04:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
programs um across the state I want to
 
04:51:46.110 --> 04:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
just address this one item even though
 
04:51:47.910 --> 04:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
the children's stomach is full it
 
04:51:50.590 --> 04:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that their cells um have
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
the adequate nutrition to
 
04:51:56.590 --> 04:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
succeed I can tell you that the belly of
 
04:51:58.990 --> 04:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
a child could be full of a poptart that
 
04:52:00.910 --> 04:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
they're receiving from aable food but
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
their cells are not getting enough
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
adequate nutrition to grow and to learn
 
04:52:08.190 --> 04:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
the school meals are designed to have
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
the correct nutrition they're vitamin
 
04:52:12.470 --> 04:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
rich fortified the H more protein the
 
04:52:14.070 --> 04:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
fruits and vegetables served within the
 
04:52:17.190 --> 04:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
schools there's they reach half the
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
requirement per day for adequate growth
 
04:52:22.628 --> 04:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
it's very strict with USDA regulations
 
04:52:25.390 --> 04:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
and state regulations in it in 2025 they
 
04:52:26.948 --> 04:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
just changed the sodium level again to
 
04:52:30.270 --> 04:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
reduce that in children and School meals
 
04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
since the school meals are adequately
 
04:52:34.350 --> 04:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
healthy the research states that those
 
04:52:35.948 --> 04:52:35.958 align:start position:0%
who eat the meals at school are more
 
04:52:38.628 --> 04:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
likely to graduate have better grades
 
04:52:40.510 --> 04:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
they also have less behavior problems
 
04:52:45.470 --> 04:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:47.788 --> 04:52:47.798 align:start position:0%
attendance Nancy Von did mention the
 
04:52:50.788 --> 04:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy Institute um I have a I
 
04:52:53.430 --> 04:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
believe we handed that out as well in it
 
04:52:56.270 --> 04:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
stated in 2024 a family of three needed
 
04:52:59.470 --> 04:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.430 --> 04:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
97,7 annually to have enough money for
 
04:53:06.030 --> 04:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
living expenses that's all the
 
04:53:08.750 --> 04:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
expenses currently for free meals right
 
04:53:11.868 --> 04:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
now in New Hampshire a family three um
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:18.110 --> 04:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
34,653 and reduced
 
04:53:20.270 --> 04:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
meals this bill would reduce
 
04:53:22.590 --> 04:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
Administration burden at the schools and
 
04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
lower the amount of school meal debt
 
04:53:26.350 --> 04:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
within the schools and that School Meal
 
04:53:28.150 --> 04:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
debt is AC Creed because those
 
04:53:29.948 --> 04:53:29.958 align:start position:0%
individuals do not qualify for the free
 
04:53:32.430 --> 04:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
and reduced meals but cannot afford um
 
04:53:33.830 --> 04:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
for their family to have those children
 
04:53:36.990 --> 04:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
eat food at
 
04:53:39.390 --> 04:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
school specifically the conquered School
 
04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
District had an alltime high of over
 
04:53:44.990 --> 04:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
$90,000 of school meal debt when talking
 
04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
with the business administrator and the
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
food service director over there
 
04:53:53.948 --> 04:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
currently they're over 53,000 $53,000 of
 
04:53:56.590 --> 04:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
school meal debt as of
 
04:53:59.470 --> 04:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
today the school sees this as a need in
 
04:54:01.390 --> 04:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
supporting those families who are making
 
04:54:04.670 --> 04:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
more than $35,000 annually and less than
 
04:54:07.190 --> 04:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
that $97,000 annually for household
 
04:54:09.070 --> 04:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
expense of the fiscal policy Institute
 
04:54:11.270 --> 04:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
stated there's a lot of people falling
 
04:54:14.070 --> 04:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
through the cracks and it's not only
 
04:54:16.310 --> 04:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
dual income families they're single
 
04:54:18.390 --> 04:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
families and there's an all-time high of
 
04:54:20.990 --> 04:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
kinship families out there grandparents
 
04:54:22.670 --> 04:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
taking care of their grandchildren in
 
04:54:22.680 --> 04:54:23.750 align:start position:0%

04:54:26.150 --> 04:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we did have a reference chart
 
04:54:28.390 --> 04:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
that we handed out for the fiscal note
 
04:54:30.590 --> 04:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
and I am open to taking any questions
 
04:54:32.230 --> 04:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
04:54:33.628 --> 04:54:33.638 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:54:37.868 --> 04:54:37.878 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing yes represent
 
04:54:40.150 --> 04:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:54:42.030 --> 04:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for providing the
 
04:54:44.110 --> 04:54:44.120 align:start position:0%
presentation I'm sure my question will
 
04:54:47.708 --> 04:54:47.718 align:start position:0%
come as no surprise to you um you you
 
04:54:49.830 --> 04:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
stated that there is a certain
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of people reported as not
 
04:54:54.350 --> 04:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
having enough food I don't remember I I
 
04:54:56.350 --> 04:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
could you repeat that percentage US
 
04:55:00.390 --> 04:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
Census pulse data it's 39% 39 and my
 
04:55:04.030 --> 04:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
question is are those do those people
 
04:55:06.430 --> 04:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
lack enough food or is the definition of
 
04:55:09.030 --> 04:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
food insecurity that is used to get that
 
04:55:11.548 --> 04:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
information brought and it includes
 
04:55:13.548 --> 04:55:13.558 align:start position:0%
people that have enough food at this
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
time but may worry about future food
 
04:55:19.150 --> 04:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
availability thank you for your question
 
04:55:21.510 --> 04:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
so the US Census it is subjective to the
 
04:55:23.230 --> 04:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
individual who's who's answering the
 
04:55:25.590 --> 04:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
question so not having enough food in
 
04:55:28.788 --> 04:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
general um I would state that they had
 
04:55:30.510 --> 04:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
to search Elsewhere for other food
 
04:55:32.590 --> 04:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
sources such as charitable food
 
04:55:35.470 --> 04:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
donations or other sources thank you
 
04:55:35.480 --> 04:55:36.830 align:start position:0%
donations or other sources thank you
further

04:55:36.830 --> 04:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:55:39.750 --> 04:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
04:55:49.868 --> 04:55:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:55.150 --> 04:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
applebe Mike appleberg okay with bad
 
04:55:57.390 --> 04:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
handwriting um so my name is Mike
 
04:55:59.230 --> 04:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
appleberg I'm president of United wave
 
04:56:01.708 --> 04:56:01.718 align:start position:0%
of Greater nashaa and we I'm here
 
04:56:03.670 --> 04:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
representing our organization in support
 
04:56:08.110 --> 04:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
of HB 665 increasing access to free
 
04:56:10.708 --> 04:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
School meals for families up to 300% of
 
04:56:13.708 --> 04:56:13.718 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty level for us this
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill represents a crucial step ensuring
 
04:56:18.270 --> 04:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
that no child in New Hampshire goes
 
04:56:20.750 --> 04:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
hungry at school simply because their
 
04:56:22.910 --> 04:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
family earns slightly too much money to
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
qualify for
 
04:56:27.470 --> 04:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
assistance to put some numbers on it and
 
04:56:29.948 --> 04:56:29.958 align:start position:0%
a little bit to representative McGuire
 
04:56:33.990 --> 04:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
Maguire's earlier question about Hunger
 
04:56:37.670 --> 04:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
um right now a family of four four
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
people must earn less than $39,000 to
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
qualify for free School meals and no
 
04:56:45.030 --> 04:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
more than
 
04:56:49.110 --> 04:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
$55,000 to R receive reduced price meals
 
04:56:52.430 --> 04:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
HB 665 would raise that limit to $90,000
 
04:56:55.310 --> 04:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
Rec Rec recognizing that many Working
 
04:56:57.830 --> 04:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
Families do struggle to afford basic
 
04:57:00.670 --> 04:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
necessities despite not meeting these
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
very low thresholds in NASA alone the
 
04:57:06.788 --> 04:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
effect would be significant currently
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
over, 1500 students receive reduced
 
04:57:10.708 --> 04:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
price meals
 
04:57:12.628 --> 04:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
meaning their families still have to pay
 
04:57:14.868 --> 04:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
for food out of pocket under this bill
 
04:57:17.150 --> 04:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
these students would move automatically
 
04:57:20.310 --> 04:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
into the reduce price the free category
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
ensuring that every child who gets who
 
04:57:24.948 --> 04:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
needs a meal will get a meal without
 
04:57:26.788 --> 04:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
barriers and without
 
04:57:29.628 --> 04:57:29.638 align:start position:0%
stigma additionally other other families
 
04:57:32.590 --> 04:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
earning between 185% and
 
04:57:35.270 --> 04:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
300% Who currently receive no meal
 
04:57:37.470 --> 04:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
assistance will finally get the support
 
04:57:39.750 --> 04:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
they need in our community to ensure
 
04:57:41.910 --> 04:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
that they children are wellfed at school
 
04:57:43.948 --> 04:57:43.958 align:start position:0%
we know that hunger affects learning we
 
04:57:46.628 --> 04:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
all know that studies show that
 
04:57:48.830 --> 04:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
well-nourished students perform better
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
academically attend school more
 
04:57:54.628 --> 04:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
regularly and have fewer disciplinary
 
04:57:57.470 --> 04:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
issues the benefits extend far beyond
 
04:57:59.708 --> 04:57:59.718 align:start position:0%
the classroom studies show that for
 
04:58:02.270 --> 04:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
every $1 invested in school meal
 
04:58:04.868 --> 04:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
programs there is a return of up to $7
 
04:58:07.548 --> 04:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
in economic benefits including higher
 
04:58:09.788 --> 04:58:09.798 align:start position:0%
graduation rates better long-term
 
04:58:11.470 --> 04:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
earning earning potential and lower
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
health care costs HB 665 is a modest
 
04:58:17.030 --> 04:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
investment with a major return
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
especially because much of the school
 
04:58:21.110 --> 04:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
funding already comes from federal
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
sources thus reducing the burden on our
 
04:58:26.670 --> 04:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
state budget for Nasha families this
 
04:58:28.948 --> 04:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
bill would eliminate a major financial
 
04:58:31.510 --> 04:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
burden many parents work hard already to
 
04:58:33.150 --> 04:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
support their children but they struggle
 
04:58:35.708 --> 04:58:35.718 align:start position:0%
to afford not just the rising cost of
 
04:58:38.868 --> 04:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
food but also Child Care housing and
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
Medical Care
 
04:58:42.628 --> 04:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
at United Way We believe no child should
 
04:58:45.750 --> 04:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
have to learn on an empty stomach HB 665
 
04:58:49.110 --> 04:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
for us is common sense um and helps to
 
04:58:51.230 --> 04:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
ensure that every child has what they
 
04:58:53.430 --> 04:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
need to learn I urge you to support and
 
04:58:56.350 --> 04:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
pass HB 665 and I welcome any questions
 
04:58:59.548 --> 04:58:59.558 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions yes
 
04:59:01.548 --> 04:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
representative papovich thank you Mr
 
04:59:03.030 --> 04:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here and
 
04:59:05.628 --> 04:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
testifying I have a very short question
 
04:59:07.750 --> 04:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
because it's already late in the day of
 
04:59:10.628 --> 04:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
course um could you tell me since you do
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
work with a lot of families and kids
 
04:59:14.510 --> 04:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
that are dealing with you know food
 
04:59:17.750 --> 04:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
insecurity issues are you familiar with
 
04:59:21.150 --> 04:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
situations in which school kids go to
 
04:59:23.830 --> 04:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know the lunch counter and are
 
04:59:25.310 --> 04:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
denied a
 
04:59:28.868 --> 04:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
meal um denied a meal not per se our
 
04:59:32.030 --> 04:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
school district and our food services
 
04:59:36.110 --> 04:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
director is very clear in her mandate to
 
04:59:39.150 --> 04:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
feed our children that said many
 
04:59:41.310 --> 04:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
children will
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
not go to get a meal because they don't
 
04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
want the stigma of having to incur incur
 
04:59:50.230 --> 04:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
debt there is definitely an issue around
 
04:59:52.750 --> 04:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
that so they might self choose not to go
 
04:59:54.750 --> 04:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
get that meal but being absolutely like
 
04:59:57.150 --> 04:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
sort of outright denied that's not going
 
05:00:00.708 --> 05:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
to be the case we have a program um in
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
nashwa called meals matter which is a
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
student Le initiative that has raised
 
05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
pretty significant funds to help pay for
 
05:00:11.230 --> 05:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
some of the student that that has come
 
05:00:14.190 --> 05:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
about as a result of uh people who are
 
05:00:17.310 --> 05:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
in the reduced price category not being
 
05:00:20.470 --> 05:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
able to actually pay off that lunch debt
 
05:00:24.030 --> 05:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
and they've helped to supplant that so
 
05:00:26.548 --> 05:00:26.558 align:start position:0%
uh yes and no thank you so much I
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate it absolutely of course yes
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um and it was
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
sort of touched on before um by the uh
 
05:00:36.788 --> 05:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
testimony from New Hampshire hunger
 
05:00:39.030 --> 05:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
Solutions but can you talk a little bit
 
05:00:40.868 --> 05:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
maybe about the differ
 
05:00:45.868 --> 05:00:45.878 align:start position:0%
between um a sun butter sandwich versus
 
05:00:49.628 --> 05:00:49.638 align:start position:0%
a meal um under this program and what
 
05:00:51.270 --> 05:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
the nutritional and and I don't know if
 
05:00:53.750 --> 05:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
you're able to speak to that um but the
 
05:00:55.628 --> 05:00:55.638 align:start position:0%
nutritional difference between those two
 
05:00:58.868 --> 05:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
things and the fact that one might be
 
05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
solving the immediate hunger issue um
 
05:01:06.708 --> 05:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
but is certainly not addressing adequate
 
05:01:10.350 --> 05:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
nutrition yeah I am absolutely not not a
 
05:01:13.070 --> 05:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
nutrition expert I will tell you I have
 
05:01:15.350 --> 05:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
eaten sun butter and I do on a regular
 
05:01:17.708 --> 05:01:17.718 align:start position:0%
basis personally but that's just me
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
personally I do know anecdotally that um
 
05:01:23.948 --> 05:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's reasons for
 
05:01:26.190 --> 05:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
that that have also to do with allergies
 
05:01:28.548 --> 05:01:28.558 align:start position:0%
and allergens in the classroom but I
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
can't I can't qu qualify that I my
 
05:01:31.868 --> 05:01:31.878 align:start position:0%
understanding is that a sun butter
 
05:01:34.030 --> 05:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
sandwich is actually very healthy it's
 
05:01:37.030 --> 05:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
just not necessarily the thing that's
 
05:01:38.910 --> 05:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
desired I don't know if that answers
 
05:01:42.270 --> 05:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
your question thank you further
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
05:01:46.350 --> 05:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
I have some written testimony I'll pass
 
05:01:49.868 --> 05:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
up to you as well oh there was one
 
05:01:53.070 --> 05:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
represent crean go ahead thank you sorry
 
05:01:55.868 --> 05:01:55.878 align:start position:0%
no I just want to make clear our in
 
05:02:00.670 --> 05:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
you're from nsha yes so when a child um
 
05:02:02.948 --> 05:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
if there is debt owed and he's not able
 
05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
to get a meal are you saying in nashille
 
05:02:06.990 --> 05:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
do that they will give them a regular
 
05:02:10.030 --> 05:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
meal or are they supplementing with a p
 
05:02:12.910 --> 05:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
butter or a sun butter sandwich I think
 
05:02:14.510 --> 05:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
it depends on the school and the grade
 
05:02:16.590 --> 05:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
level um there I know that there are
 
05:02:18.070 --> 05:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
different approaches in the elementary
 
05:02:19.390 --> 05:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
schools and there are in the middle and
 
05:02:21.868 --> 05:02:21.878 align:start position:0%
high schools I just know from speaking
 
05:02:24.990 --> 05:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
directly with our food services director
 
05:02:27.390 --> 05:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
and knowing her pretty well for the past
 
05:02:30.470 --> 05:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
six or seven years she's got it she and
 
05:02:32.548 --> 05:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
her staff have a pretty clear mandate
 
05:02:36.510 --> 05:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
that their job is to feed kids um they
 
05:02:39.548 --> 05:02:39.558 align:start position:0%
worry about lunch debt that accumulates
 
05:02:43.150 --> 05:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
I know that the attempt that our muls
 
05:02:46.628 --> 05:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
matter program um put in place was sort
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
of a voucher type program so kids could
 
05:02:52.230 --> 05:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
access food when they you know they
 
05:02:54.548 --> 05:02:54.558 align:start position:0%
could choose to do that that didn't
 
05:02:56.030 --> 05:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
really work because kids felt really
 
05:02:58.030 --> 05:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable asking for you know a
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
voucher because it would kind of call
 
05:03:03.430 --> 05:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
them out um I I I do not know specific
 
05:03:05.150 --> 05:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
instances where they're denied food
 
05:03:08.310 --> 05:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
though they will encumber debt though
 
05:03:10.990 --> 05:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank you
 
05:03:29.670 --> 05:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:32.310 --> 05:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
Burke good afternoon chairman lad and
 
05:03:34.150 --> 05:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thanks for
 
05:03:37.070 --> 05:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
having this important hearing my name is
 
05:03:39.430 --> 05:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
Joanne Burke I live in New Market as a
 
05:03:39.440 --> 05:03:40.350 align:start position:0%
Joanne Burke I live in New Market as a
mother

05:03:40.350 --> 05:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
mother
 
05:03:42.510 --> 05:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
a health professional and a former
 
05:03:45.190 --> 05:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
nutrition professional at the University
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I come before you with
 
05:03:52.110 --> 05:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:55.310 --> 05:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
6665 um you know there has been a
 
05:03:56.910 --> 05:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
question about the data what does the
 
05:03:59.910 --> 05:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
data show well nationally um we do have
 
05:04:02.708 --> 05:04:02.718 align:start position:0%
data from the economic benefits of um
 
05:04:05.590 --> 05:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
Child Nutrition report of
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
2024 showing that it uh good nutrition
 
05:04:11.390 --> 05:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
in school improve Children's Health
 
05:04:14.310 --> 05:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
well-being and during childhood and that
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
that predicts better outcomes as adults
 
05:04:20.510 --> 05:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
and E economic achievement and um
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
academic achievement in the
 
05:04:26.750 --> 05:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
2021 The Rocker Feller Foundation which
 
05:04:28.868 --> 05:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
has far more money than we do to do
 
05:04:30.510 --> 05:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
these kinds of studies and the center
 
05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
for good food
 
05:04:35.310 --> 05:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
purchasing showed that on the average
 
05:04:38.990 --> 05:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
School meals um could cost around 40
 
05:04:39.000 --> 05:04:40.150 align:start position:0%
School meals um could cost around 40
billion

05:04:40.150 --> 05:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
billion
 
05:04:44.788 --> 05:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
but it exceeds far more the um no I'm
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
sorry on the average um School Meal
 
05:04:49.760 --> 05:04:51.910 align:start position:0%
sorry on the average um School Meal
programs

05:04:51.910 --> 05:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:04:55.390 --> 05:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
um have economic benefits that far
 
05:04:57.948 --> 05:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
exceed when we look at the health care
 
05:05:00.150 --> 05:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
cost associated with inadequate
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
nutrition so when we think of investing
 
05:05:05.150 --> 05:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
in our children and the child's capital
 
05:05:07.628 --> 05:05:07.638 align:start position:0%
and during this hearing people have said
 
05:05:10.030 --> 05:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
well what about some of the foods being
 
05:05:11.910 --> 05:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
offered and it is true it can be
 
05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
confusing because a very similar brand
 
05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
offered at the school has to meet higher
 
05:05:20.150 --> 05:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
standards I wish that would be happening
 
05:05:23.310 --> 05:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
at the hords so I though I admit
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
confusion those particular products are
 
05:05:28.548 --> 05:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
designed for school Food Service to meet
 
05:05:32.990 --> 05:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
those CR criteria and if the the main
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
part is to to look at this poverty level
 
05:05:40.110 --> 05:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
because I based it on for a family of
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
three um and the federal poverty level
 
05:05:45.910 --> 05:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
is by household size so that doesn't
 
05:05:48.548 --> 05:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
count that you might be a single parent
 
05:05:51.470 --> 05:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
and have child care costs so the federal
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
poverty level we know is artificially
 
05:05:57.788 --> 05:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
low um it is not a get by level it does
 
05:05:59.990 --> 05:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
not mean if you are above the federal
 
05:06:03.990 --> 05:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
poverty level you can afford to live
 
05:06:06.350 --> 05:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
adequately so the
 
05:06:10.670 --> 05:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
HHS first box on the handout shows the
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
around 80,000 for a family of three to
 
05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
get by in New Hampshire using the
 
05:06:18.910 --> 05:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level if we go to
 
05:06:21.190 --> 05:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized organizations that
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
are updating um regularly the MIT
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
 
05:06:31.110 --> 05:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
cost to living for the State of New
 
05:06:35.910 --> 05:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has it at almost 20,000 more
 
05:06:39.948 --> 05:06:39.958 align:start position:0%
so at 300% of poverty we are not being
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
frivolous we are helping families who
 
05:06:48.070 --> 05:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
are working being able to have those
 
05:06:49.830 --> 05:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
that money that they may have spent on
 
05:06:52.750 --> 05:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
trying to put together a school lunch to
 
05:06:56.788 --> 05:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
pay for housing groceries Etc the um
 
05:06:59.150 --> 05:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
Economic Policy Institute has similar
 
05:07:02.548 --> 05:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
numbers I will say I had to average
 
05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
nashwa and Manchester they don't do the
 
05:07:07.150 --> 05:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so I did take the
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
two largest communities there
 
05:07:12.270 --> 05:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
so I know that chairman lad worked as a
 
05:07:15.868 --> 05:07:15.878 align:start position:0%
school principal and as a teacher knows
 
05:07:18.390 --> 05:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
that hungry children and hungry adults
 
05:07:20.670 --> 05:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
have a hard time concentrating in
 
05:07:23.628 --> 05:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
learning and we are making it easier for
 
05:07:26.868 --> 05:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
the children for the for the school
 
05:07:29.230 --> 05:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
staff that are trying to manage school
 
05:07:32.190 --> 05:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
debt and for the parents and Care
 
05:07:35.590 --> 05:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
caregivers by providing school lunch and
 
05:07:39.708 --> 05:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
breakfast at the 300% of poverty level I
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
would like to see you know Universal
 
05:07:44.788 --> 05:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
meals for all but
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
300% surely helps those Working Families
 
05:07:51.030 --> 05:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as a good start so
 
05:07:54.548 --> 05:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
please vote in favor of
 
05:07:57.350 --> 05:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
665 I thank you for the work you do on
 
05:07:59.190 --> 05:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
behalf of children their families and
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
our communities and I'm open for
 
05:08:04.150 --> 05:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for coming
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
are there any questions yes
 
05:08:07.830 --> 05:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative Burton I'm not sure you
 
05:08:09.628 --> 05:08:09.638 align:start position:0%
can answer this question but I want been
 
05:08:12.270 --> 05:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
wanting to ask it all along um I'm
 
05:08:15.548 --> 05:08:15.558 align:start position:0%
painfully aware of the need for proper
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
food for children with type 1
 
05:08:22.190 --> 05:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
diabetes um they have to balance insulin
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
exercise and food is
 
05:08:28.190 --> 05:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
there in the school in this program and
 
05:08:30.150 --> 05:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
other programs are they accounted for
 
05:08:32.350 --> 05:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
somehow uh you know I really do believe
 
05:08:34.110 --> 05:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
so because we do have registered
 
05:08:36.670 --> 05:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
dietitians and access to that kind of
 
05:08:41.430 --> 05:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
support so um a a child child um would
 
05:08:42.910 --> 05:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
the school will be able to work with
 
05:08:46.190 --> 05:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
that child so surely um if they are
 
05:08:49.350 --> 05:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
known they that the school meals could
 
05:08:51.628 --> 05:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
easily meet these requirements but
 
05:08:53.708 --> 05:08:53.718 align:start position:0%
thanks for asking that just quick follow
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
one uh thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
05:08:59.270 --> 05:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
then then this program would benefit
 
05:09:01.670 --> 05:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
those students who who might not get
 
05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
enough of the right Foods absolutely I
 
05:09:06.070 --> 05:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
mean you bring up a really good point
 
05:09:07.708 --> 05:09:07.718 align:start position:0%
what we find and this happens with
 
05:09:10.868 --> 05:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
adults who have died diabetes if when
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
food is insecure they start cutting back
 
05:09:15.150 --> 05:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
on food but they may be taking their
 
05:09:16.990 --> 05:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
medicine at the same level and you run
 
05:09:20.150 --> 05:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
the risk of hypoglycemia so we we know
 
05:09:24.670 --> 05:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
nationally that the last eight days of
 
05:09:26.990 --> 05:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
um food assistance from the snap program
 
05:09:28.948 --> 05:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
there's much more of an incident of
 
05:09:32.548 --> 05:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemia out of Kaiser Permanente so
 
05:09:35.310 --> 05:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
this makes sense and a really good um
 
05:09:37.830 --> 05:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
point to be made thank you further
 
05:09:39.750 --> 05:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
05:09:42.070 --> 05:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
05:09:43.150 --> 05:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you know the
 
05:09:45.750 --> 05:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
answer to my earlier question about uh
 
05:09:48.510 --> 05:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
what fraction of um children from this
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
set of households are
 
05:09:53.150 --> 05:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
malnourished we don't we don't routinely
 
05:09:54.548 --> 05:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
I mean right now the state of New
 
05:09:57.310 --> 05:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no longer even takes Heights
 
05:09:59.310 --> 05:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
and weights because of a lot of
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
different reasons but I can assure you
 
05:10:05.590 --> 05:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
that with you know when you look at the
 
05:10:09.390 --> 05:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
house of costing of of housing what was
 
05:10:12.070 --> 05:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
100,000 to buy a house in 1980 is now
 
05:10:15.750 --> 05:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
close to 500,000 so what I'm saying is
 
05:10:17.270 --> 05:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
at this
 
05:10:20.230 --> 05:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
79,000 it is hard on that federal
 
05:10:23.150 --> 05:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
poverty level for even that group to buy
 
05:10:25.590 --> 05:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
nutritious food because if you look at
 
05:10:29.788 --> 05:10:29.798 align:start position:0%
the MIT and the Epi data it's at least
 
05:10:33.590 --> 05:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
20,000 more so the risk is if any of us
 
05:10:36.230 --> 05:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
know what it's like with hungry kids if
 
05:10:38.470 --> 05:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
you're short on a budget are you going
 
05:10:42.190 --> 05:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
to buy oranges or a bigger bag of potato
 
05:10:45.430 --> 05:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
chips that goes further so more
 
05:10:48.670 --> 05:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
nutritious food costs more money we saw
 
05:10:52.670 --> 05:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
in covid when's children had adequate
 
05:10:56.430 --> 05:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
meal those dollars that families had
 
05:10:58.830 --> 05:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
rippled through the economy these are
 
05:11:00.390 --> 05:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
not people that are sending their
 
05:11:03.070 --> 05:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
dollars to invest overseas these are
 
05:11:04.910 --> 05:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
people that generate the funds that were
 
05:11:07.470 --> 05:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that now get their car
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
fixed or they um go go get a dentist
 
05:11:14.788 --> 05:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
appointment Etc so though we as a state
 
05:11:17.910 --> 05:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't invest in I mean it's hard work to
 
05:11:21.310 --> 05:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
do you got to follow kids over time but
 
05:11:24.990 --> 05:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
nationally we know that kids health is
 
05:11:28.868 --> 05:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
less robust the lower the income and the
 
05:11:34.030 --> 05:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
data here surely shows the this level is
 
05:11:36.310 --> 05:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative of families struggling to
 
05:11:39.868 --> 05:11:39.878 align:start position:0%
get by because it's it's not even what
 
05:11:42.830 --> 05:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
we acknowledge is probably the real cost
 
05:11:45.628 --> 05:11:45.638 align:start position:0%
of of
 
05:11:49.470 --> 05:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
thriving yes thank you so you just said
 
05:11:52.270 --> 05:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
that um when income level is
 
05:11:55.868 --> 05:11:55.878 align:start position:0%
lower um kids health is nutrition is
 
05:11:58.708 --> 05:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
worse right typically it typically I
 
05:12:02.708 --> 05:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
mean nationally yeah yeah so so but
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
specifically this food program exists
 
05:12:07.990 --> 05:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
all over the
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
nation right
 
05:12:12.948 --> 05:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
so the school lunch does but there's a
 
05:12:16.430 --> 05:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
big gap between school lunch who
 
05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
qualifies for that there are many
 
05:12:21.310 --> 05:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
children and it's the Working Poor that
 
05:12:23.670 --> 05:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
get really in between that we don't have
 
05:12:27.150 --> 05:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
data we can look a kid done school lunch
 
05:12:29.470 --> 05:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
and participation and they're doing
 
05:12:32.910 --> 05:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
better than the kid whose parents make
 
05:12:35.628 --> 05:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
$200 more than the current federal cut
 
05:12:39.628 --> 05:12:39.638 align:start position:0%
offs so I would posit that it is the
 
05:12:43.110 --> 05:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
working class person and family and
 
05:12:46.390 --> 05:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
household who makes too much to
 
05:12:50.030 --> 05:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
participate we have data a food research
 
05:12:52.548 --> 05:12:52.558 align:start position:0%
Action Center I'm sure hunger Solutions
 
05:12:55.390 --> 05:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
can provide you that School meals make a
 
05:12:57.830 --> 05:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
critical difference where we don't have
 
05:12:59.990 --> 05:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
as good a data is that monkey in the
 
05:13:02.190 --> 05:13:02.200 align:start position:0%
middle the kid who says I'm not going to
 
05:13:04.430 --> 05:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
be embarrassed I'm not going to get in
 
05:13:06.548 --> 05:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
line they they're going to give me a
 
05:13:08.190 --> 05:13:08.200 align:start position:0%
different looking lunch and sometimes
 
05:13:10.270 --> 05:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
that happens sometimes times it doesn't
 
05:13:14.230 --> 05:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't take long for a child
 
05:13:16.830 --> 05:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
particularly you see the numbers go off
 
05:13:21.270 --> 05:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
as they get older to avoid
 
05:13:25.350 --> 05:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
shaming ma'am one more so specifically
 
05:13:28.470 --> 05:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
what I'm getting at is
 
05:13:31.868 --> 05:13:31.878 align:start position:0%
um the programs start at zero and go to
 
05:13:37.270 --> 05:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
some level right this 1 185% of poverty
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
and presumably that's similar in other
 
05:13:44.830 --> 05:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
states and so the argument is that those
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
in the program do better than those not
 
05:13:51.548 --> 05:13:51.558 align:start position:0%
right so the ones from 185 to 300 so
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
there should be data that's that's broad
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
right for for the whole country even
 
05:13:59.470 --> 05:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
that that children in this lower level
 
05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
are better uh have better nutrition than
 
05:14:05.910 --> 05:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
those just above it they have better
 
05:14:08.110 --> 05:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
nutrition for what they're eating at
 
05:14:08.120 --> 05:14:09.628 align:start position:0%
nutrition for what they're eating at
school

05:14:09.628 --> 05:14:09.638 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:14:12.030 --> 05:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
not all of those families will be snap
 
05:14:15.310 --> 05:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
eligible the reality is in America we
 
05:14:17.350 --> 05:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
have hunger rates that look like a third
 
05:14:21.270 --> 05:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
world country the school offers an easy
 
05:14:24.830 --> 05:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
way to address bigger questions right
 
05:14:28.590 --> 05:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
like why are women in our state making
 
05:14:31.350 --> 05:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
77 cents on the dollar compared to men
 
05:14:33.948 --> 05:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
Inc comparable jobs but we can't figure
 
05:14:37.070 --> 05:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
that out right now in this hearing but
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
what we can do in in institutions that
 
05:14:43.628 --> 05:14:43.638 align:start position:0%
currently exist such as schools help to
 
05:14:47.670 --> 05:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
manage that Gap and help to address as a
 
05:14:50.110 --> 05:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
community where that is where families
 
05:14:50.120 --> 05:14:50.948 align:start position:0%
community where that is where families
are

05:14:50.948 --> 05:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:14:53.670 --> 05:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
congregating it is a simple coste
 
05:14:57.110 --> 05:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
effective way and the the meals that we
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
provide through school lunch and
 
05:15:02.350 --> 05:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
breakfast are far different than what
 
05:15:04.708 --> 05:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
your local Pantry can give that may or
 
05:15:07.190 --> 05:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
may not have a refrigerator that may
 
05:15:10.350 --> 05:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
have limited hours per family
 
05:15:13.270 --> 05:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
so you're right it would be great if we
 
05:15:16.510 --> 05:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
had data about every demographic we
 
05:15:19.830 --> 05:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
don't but we do know of the group we
 
05:15:21.390 --> 05:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
study and this has actually been a
 
05:15:24.190 --> 05:15:24.200 align:start position:0%
debate in my nutrition field this comes
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
up to be quite honest I I brought it up
 
05:15:30.430 --> 05:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
at a national meeting 16 months ago that
 
05:15:32.990 --> 05:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have good data on this fairy
 
05:15:35.110 --> 05:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
group that you're asking about but it
 
05:15:37.070 --> 05:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
makes if it walks like a duck talks like
 
05:15:39.470 --> 05:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
a duck probably a duck makes common
 
05:15:43.230 --> 05:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
sense that these families are resource
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
constrained even at
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
300% and the one place that people feel
 
05:15:52.788 --> 05:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
they can try to manage they're not going
 
05:15:54.510 --> 05:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
to get bounced out of their house if
 
05:15:56.470 --> 05:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
they don't feed their kids well enough
 
05:15:58.270 --> 05:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
they will get bounced off if they don't
 
05:16:00.190 --> 05:16:00.200 align:start position:0%
come up with the rent and they need to
 
05:16:02.788 --> 05:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
put gas in their car to go to work so
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
food is sort of that luxury item and the
 
05:16:07.510 --> 05:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
meanwhile the kids
 
05:16:09.830 --> 05:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
suffer thank you thank you very much are
 
05:16:11.110 --> 05:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
there further
 
05:16:14.788 --> 05:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
questions yes thank you Mr chairman
 
05:16:17.110 --> 05:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
05:16:18.708 --> 05:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
think you've said a couple of times now
 
05:16:20.110 --> 05:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
that the food that the kids are getting
 
05:16:24.190 --> 05:16:24.200 align:start position:0%
in school has is nutrition packed um and
 
05:16:26.310 --> 05:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
so my question on that is when I look at
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
a menu item that says cheesy bites
 
05:16:30.750 --> 05:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
marinara and Scooby-Doo graham crackers
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
right are you telling me that they're
 
05:16:34.788 --> 05:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
buying this at a specific food source
 
05:16:36.510 --> 05:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
are all of our schools in New Hampshire
 
05:16:38.470 --> 05:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
buying this at from a specific food
 
05:16:40.990 --> 05:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
source that they they whatever food
 
05:16:42.948 --> 05:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
source I'm not a school food service
 
05:16:46.470 --> 05:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
director but if the school is purchasing
 
05:16:49.150 --> 05:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
it through the federal food food
 
05:16:52.868 --> 05:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
nutrition program that item has to meet
 
05:16:56.070 --> 05:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
criteria would I like to see the the
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
meals even more nutritious yes but the
 
05:17:02.310 --> 05:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
vendor has to meet sodium and fat
 
05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
requirements there's a whole list for
 
05:17:07.830 --> 05:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
school Food Service directors of what
 
05:17:09.390 --> 05:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
they can purchase
 
05:17:13.070 --> 05:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
so it could be a vendor so that you have
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
to meet the criteria so it's not just
 
05:17:17.110 --> 05:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
they meeting criteria and protein and
 
05:17:20.110 --> 05:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
carbs also in addition to sodium yes
 
05:17:21.788 --> 05:17:21.798 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you very much are
 
05:17:23.110 --> 05:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
there further questions from the
 
05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing it thank you very
 
05:17:28.110 --> 05:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
much thank you so much appreciate this
 
05:17:29.750 --> 05:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
and all the work you do you're more than
 
05:17:50.548 --> 05:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:52.390 --> 05:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon chairman lad members
 
05:17:54.510 --> 05:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
of the House Education funding committee
 
05:17:56.708 --> 05:17:56.718 align:start position:0%
uh Deber house president of the American

Federation of teachers New Hampshire and
 
05:18:02.910 --> 05:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
I will um try not to repeat some of the
 
05:18:05.070 --> 05:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
statistics you've already heard uh but
 
05:18:07.548 --> 05:18:07.558 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of my members and the
 
05:18:11.150 --> 05:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
students we work with to support HB 655
 
05:18:13.708 --> 05:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
uh we should be feeding as many of our
 
05:18:16.750 --> 05:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
students in school who uh have need of
 
05:18:19.150 --> 05:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
that kind of support because hungry kids
 
05:18:22.868 --> 05:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
don't learn well um almost 40% of our
 
05:18:25.788 --> 05:18:25.798 align:start position:0%
grand State children live in families
 
05:18:27.590 --> 05:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
that experience some kind of food
 
05:18:30.030 --> 05:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
insecurity at least from time to time
 
05:18:32.310 --> 05:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
that may mean that at the end of a pay
 
05:18:34.750 --> 05:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
period or at the end of a month the
 
05:18:36.788 --> 05:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
family is running out of food and
 
05:18:38.110 --> 05:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot left in the cupboard
 
05:18:40.230 --> 05:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
so they may be to school hungry they may
 
05:18:42.788 --> 05:18:42.798 align:start position:0%
not have much in their lunch
 
05:18:45.868 --> 05:18:45.878 align:start position:0%
box so they are trying to do the hard
 
05:18:48.670 --> 05:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
work of learning and getting along with
 
05:18:50.830 --> 05:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
their peers behaving at school on a
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
nearly empty stomach that may be going
 
05:18:54.868 --> 05:18:54.878 align:start position:0%
on for several days in a
 
05:18:57.270 --> 05:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
row um my members often dig into their
 
05:18:59.470 --> 05:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
own Pockets to stock their classrooms
 
05:19:01.310 --> 05:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
with snacks uh you know approved by
 
05:19:03.230 --> 05:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
whatever the district policy on snacks
 
05:19:05.750 --> 05:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
is because they know that kids need
 
05:19:07.470 --> 05:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
something in their bellies to you know
 
05:19:09.948 --> 05:19:09.958 align:start position:0%
help them get through the long hours of
 
05:19:12.270 --> 05:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh long division
 
05:19:14.670 --> 05:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
um and I remember the debates on this
 
05:19:18.270 --> 05:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
last year and hearing from some
 
05:19:19.628 --> 05:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
legislators that they were surprised
 
05:19:20.948 --> 05:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
there are Hunger kids in schools they
 
05:19:22.788 --> 05:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
didn't believe that it could happen
 
05:19:24.910 --> 05:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
because we do have to have access to a
 
05:19:27.430 --> 05:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
hot meal for every student every day but
 
05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
having access doesn't mean that the
 
05:19:31.510 --> 05:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
student family can afford to pay for it
 
05:19:33.628 --> 05:19:33.638 align:start position:0%
and that's where a lot of the problem
 
05:19:37.708 --> 05:19:37.718 align:start position:0%
comes in families do not want lunch debt
 
05:19:39.830 --> 05:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
they do not want the school district
 
05:19:42.590 --> 05:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
coming after them for lunch debt and
 
05:19:44.030 --> 05:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
students don't want to be taking a
 
05:19:45.270 --> 05:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
different meal if that's what the school
 
05:19:47.868 --> 05:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
district's policy is so that's where a
 
05:19:51.190 --> 05:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
lot of the mismatch comes in
 
05:19:53.830 --> 05:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
um I know personally of students who
 
05:19:56.270 --> 05:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
have been told by their families you do
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
not get hot lunch you do not get in that
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
hot lunch line we can't afford it don't
 
05:20:02.788 --> 05:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
go in line so they will send them with
 
05:20:05.190 --> 05:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
whatever they can put in the lunch box
 
05:20:07.390 --> 05:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
if it's just a package of uh peanut bar
 
05:20:09.910 --> 05:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
crackers or you know a couple saltines
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
and that's your lunch if that's what's
 
05:20:13.548 --> 05:20:13.558 align:start position:0%
in the cupboard that's what they might
 
05:20:16.990 --> 05:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
come to school with for lunch that
 
05:20:19.230 --> 05:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
day so they are making that decision
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to incur any more
 
05:20:22.470 --> 05:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
debt because they can't afford it we
 
05:20:24.190 --> 05:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
have got families who are doing the best
 
05:20:27.750 --> 05:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
they can to keep the family you know in
 
05:20:29.670 --> 05:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
the rented apartment meeting all their
 
05:20:32.110 --> 05:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
other expenses so expanding the
 
05:20:35.070 --> 05:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility from the current 185% to
 
05:20:37.628 --> 05:20:37.638 align:start position:0%
300% of poverty would give that many
 
05:20:39.788 --> 05:20:39.798 align:start position:0%
more of our Granite State families the
 
05:20:41.910 --> 05:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
breathing room they need to support
 
05:20:46.110 --> 05:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
their kids and when kids come to school
 
05:20:48.628 --> 05:20:48.638 align:start position:0%
and stay in school with proper nutrition
 
05:20:51.830 --> 05:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
every day they learn better um according
 
05:20:54.510 --> 05:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
to feed the children in North Carolina
 
05:20:57.670 --> 05:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
they did a study of kids who um were
 
05:20:59.830 --> 05:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
food insecure and they found at the end
 
05:21:02.110 --> 05:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
of the month when SNAP benefits run out
 
05:21:03.910 --> 05:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
their test scores of those children
 
05:21:06.590 --> 05:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
plummeted so this intermittent food
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
insecurity has an effect on learning
 
05:21:11.470 --> 05:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
it's not just long-term
 
05:21:11.480 --> 05:21:13.390 align:start position:0%
it's not just long-term
malnutrition

05:21:13.390 --> 05:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
malnutrition
 
05:21:17.390 --> 05:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
um overall kids who are food insecure
 
05:21:19.030 --> 05:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
have lower math and test score this is
 
05:21:21.230 --> 05:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
not just the same North Carolina study
 
05:21:23.150 --> 05:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
they have higher rates of absenteeism
 
05:21:24.830 --> 05:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
and tardiness at school and they are
 
05:21:26.990 --> 05:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
less likely to graduate from high school
 
05:21:29.990 --> 05:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
so HB 665 would take a big step to
 
05:21:31.868 --> 05:21:31.878 align:start position:0%
helping more Grand State families help
 
05:21:33.868 --> 05:21:33.878 align:start position:0%
the kids do better in school and help
 
05:21:35.190 --> 05:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
our school districts have less
 
05:21:36.788 --> 05:21:36.798 align:start position:0%
uncollected debt that they have to deal
 
05:21:39.150 --> 05:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
with and taxpayers have to foot
 
05:21:40.910 --> 05:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
um for all those reasons we support
 
05:21:44.670 --> 05:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
passing HP 655 and uh that's what I have
 
05:21:46.310 --> 05:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
to say thank you thank you are there any
 
05:21:48.910 --> 05:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
questions represent papich thank you Mr
 
05:21:50.830 --> 05:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for testifying nice
 
05:21:52.510 --> 05:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
seeing you again in different committee
 
05:21:55.948 --> 05:21:55.958 align:start position:0%
rooms yes um I just wanted to quickly
 
05:21:57.990 --> 05:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
ask you you described the scenario in
 
05:22:01.470 --> 05:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
which a parent doesn't send doesn't give
 
05:22:03.948 --> 05:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
the kid lunch and tells them not to get
 
05:22:06.628 --> 05:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
school launches would that in your
 
05:22:10.708 --> 05:22:10.718 align:start position:0%
personal opinion be a form of child
 
05:22:13.470 --> 05:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
neglect if it happened again and again
 
05:22:15.910 --> 05:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
and again yeah if it happens one day or
 
05:22:18.990 --> 05:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
two days where do you draw that line I
 
05:22:20.750 --> 05:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
mean if they forget to send them but ins
 
05:22:24.350 --> 05:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
is that neglect or is that uh A hurried
 
05:22:26.788 --> 05:22:26.798 align:start position:0%
morning I appreciate it thank you these
 
05:22:29.708 --> 05:22:29.718 align:start position:0%
are yeah I know it's thank you further
 
05:22:32.990 --> 05:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
questions represent fellows thank you I
 
05:22:35.910 --> 05:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
I know it must change from one school to
 
05:22:38.590 --> 05:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
another but do you have any sense of how
 
05:22:42.510 --> 05:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
many kids fit into this category where
 
05:22:46.150 --> 05:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
their their parents are are giving them
 
05:22:50.628 --> 05:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
not not a sufficient meal and or telling
 
05:22:52.350 --> 05:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
them and telling them that they can't
 
05:22:56.430 --> 05:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
get in the lunch line I is any anecdotal
 
05:22:59.750 --> 05:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
anything um I have not done a survey I'm
 
05:23:03.110 --> 05:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
just I'm drawing on yeah yeah I do have
 
05:23:05.708 --> 05:23:05.718 align:start position:0%
anol evidence from you my own experience
 
05:23:08.830 --> 05:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
from people I've worked with um it's
 
05:23:10.750 --> 05:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
going to be higher in some schools where
 
05:23:13.510 --> 05:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
you have a greater percentage of
 
05:23:16.150 --> 05:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
students or families that
 
05:23:16.160 --> 05:23:18.948 align:start position:0%
students or families that
are

05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
living you know in poverty or or near
 
05:23:24.670 --> 05:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
that poverty level but I really do not
 
05:23:27.750 --> 05:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
have the numbers to go along with this
 
05:23:28.990 --> 05:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
some of the people who were presenting
 
05:23:30.868 --> 05:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
demographics earlier might have a better
 
05:23:33.470 --> 05:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
sense of how many families we have
 
05:23:34.470 --> 05:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
because they've looked more at the
 
05:23:37.910 --> 05:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
Census Data um but yeah I just know from
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
having had
 
05:23:42.030 --> 05:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
students um whose families were
 
05:23:43.788 --> 05:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
struggling and you know sometimes they'd
 
05:23:46.628 --> 05:23:46.638 align:start position:0%
be struggling for a couple days and then
 
05:23:49.590 --> 05:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know it the check would come in and
 
05:23:52.270 --> 05:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
it would be fine or you know Mom will
 
05:23:56.150 --> 05:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
get extra hours that week or yeah that's
 
05:23:58.150 --> 05:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
how families put it together sometimes
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee not
 
05:24:02.750 --> 05:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
seeing thank you very much y invite
 
05:24:19.948 --> 05:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:22.030 --> 05:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
hi Mr chairman my name is David Trumble
 
05:24:24.910 --> 05:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
for the record from where I support this
 
05:24:27.548 --> 05:24:27.558 align:start position:0%
bill for a few reasons uh last week or
 
05:24:29.590 --> 05:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
maybe the week before you had several
 
05:24:31.230 --> 05:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
food bills and there was a lot of
 
05:24:33.310 --> 05:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
testimony about the value
 
05:24:33.320 --> 05:24:34.910 align:start position:0%
testimony about the value
of

05:24:34.910 --> 05:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:24:38.070 --> 05:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
um well-fed children just to add it
 
05:24:39.788 --> 05:24:39.798 align:start position:0%
being the record again that they're
 
05:24:42.830 --> 05:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
twice as likely to not repeat twice as
 
05:24:45.510 --> 05:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
likely to not end up in special ed
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
reduce absenteeism twice as likely
 
05:24:52.628 --> 05:24:52.638 align:start position:0%
to uh be suspended if not adequately fed
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
in four times increase in mental health
 
05:24:56.430 --> 05:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
counseling and increased reading scores
 
05:24:59.270 --> 05:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
in math and reading um I was struck in
 
05:25:02.350 --> 05:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
the discussion um by the concern two
 
05:25:04.310 --> 05:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
levels of concern first is the question
 
05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
about the 185 versus
 
05:25:10.910 --> 05:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
300% and why are we going up to that
 
05:25:12.990 --> 05:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
extra amount and so I just wanted to
 
05:25:15.788 --> 05:25:15.798 align:start position:0%
make a comparison between the EFA
 
05:25:19.150 --> 05:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
program in the reduced meals program the
 
05:25:21.430 --> 05:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
EFA program is set at
 
05:25:25.948 --> 05:25:25.958 align:start position:0%
350% if you qualify once for an EFA you
 
05:25:28.430 --> 05:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
qualify for Life your family is in that
 
05:25:30.868 --> 05:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
program forever even if you have
 
05:25:32.910 --> 05:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
multiple children in the qualify when
 
05:25:35.110 --> 05:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
the oldest one is in you can stay in
 
05:25:37.030 --> 05:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
until the youngest one graduates high
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
school this build doesn't do anything
 
05:25:41.110 --> 05:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
like that it's it's going to be an
 
05:25:44.110 --> 05:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
annual uh report based on
 
05:25:46.590 --> 05:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
300% which is in line with how all other
 
05:25:48.990 --> 05:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
income based programs are based so I
 
05:25:51.390 --> 05:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
think this is clearly very fair there
 
05:25:53.548 --> 05:25:53.558 align:start position:0%
should be no concerns about what about
 
05:25:55.990 --> 05:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
that extra between 185 and 300 when
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to 350 for the EFA program
 
05:26:01.430 --> 05:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh the second is the level of concern
 
05:26:04.030 --> 05:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
about the quality of the meals and it's
 
05:26:06.150 --> 05:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
been documented by several people that
 
05:26:07.750 --> 05:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
there are federal guidelines that have
 
05:26:09.270 --> 05:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
to be met
 
05:26:11.230 --> 05:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
and that it could be made better there's
 
05:26:13.708 --> 05:26:13.718 align:start position:0%
nothing that prevents New Hampshire from
 
05:26:16.510 --> 05:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
encouraging local schools to increase
 
05:26:18.270 --> 05:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
the quality of the meals at their
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
schools we could certainly do that you
 
05:26:21.708 --> 05:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
already have the bill to have the local
 
05:26:25.470 --> 05:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
farms to food program uh and many of the
 
05:26:27.190 --> 05:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
local schools are having green houses
 
05:26:28.510 --> 05:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
and things where their kids are growing
 
05:26:31.190 --> 05:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
some of their own meals they have a
 
05:26:34.750 --> 05:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
routinely uh a a vegetable and a fruit
 
05:26:36.470 --> 05:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
where they hand it to each child and
 
05:26:38.670 --> 05:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
they try it because it takes five or 10
 
05:26:40.430 --> 05:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
times before a child will actually eat
 
05:26:42.990 --> 05:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
something so they might not understand
 
05:26:45.590 --> 05:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
what that vegetable or fruit is today
 
05:26:47.590 --> 05:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
but over the course of attempts they get
 
05:26:50.110 --> 05:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
to use it so there's a lot of regulation
 
05:26:53.470 --> 05:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
on the quality of the content in this
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
bill just comparing it again to efas you
 
05:26:58.628 --> 05:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
all know your education oversight
 
05:27:00.350 --> 05:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee can't get any information on
 
05:27:01.990 --> 05:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
it and yet we continue to fund it to
 
05:27:03.590 --> 05:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
tens and tens of millions of dollars so
 
05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
if we're willing to go to 350 fre FAS
 
05:27:08.270 --> 05:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
where we see no need to have any
 
05:27:10.548 --> 05:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
oversight or control on the content why
 
05:27:13.230 --> 05:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
all of the sudden are we upset about
 
05:27:15.708 --> 05:27:15.718 align:start position:0%
going to 300% for feeding children and
 
05:27:17.470 --> 05:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
we already have strict regulations on
 
05:27:19.230 --> 05:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
the guidelines the the last comparison
 
05:27:21.030 --> 05:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
point is this is that every child would
 
05:27:23.708 --> 05:27:23.718 align:start position:0%
be eligible to receive these meals
 
05:27:26.070 --> 05:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
special Leed children or not we all know
 
05:27:27.868 --> 05:27:27.878 align:start position:0%
that under the EFA special ed children
 
05:27:29.868 --> 05:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
are not equally eligible because they
 
05:27:31.510 --> 05:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
have to give away their rights many of
 
05:27:33.270 --> 05:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
the EFA schools won't accept them you
 
05:27:34.990 --> 05:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
remember the testimony about that at the
 
05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
universal voucher hearing so I'm just
 
05:27:39.030 --> 05:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
saying we spend
 
05:27:40.788 --> 05:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
about the same amount of money for efas
 
05:27:42.590 --> 05:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
as you're being asked to spend on this B
 
05:27:44.190 --> 05:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
but we're concerned about the percentage
 
05:27:46.230 --> 05:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
income we're concerned about the the
 
05:27:49.030 --> 05:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
content we're concerned we're not even
 
05:27:51.510 --> 05:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the access under the FAA
 
05:27:53.628 --> 05:27:53.638 align:start position:0%
over here it meets all of these tests
 
05:27:55.310 --> 05:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
much better than that program does so
 
05:27:57.190 --> 05:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
when you're thinking about this I hope
 
05:27:59.270 --> 05:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
that people who are saying I don't know
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
if we think we can spend it will
 
05:28:02.788 --> 05:28:02.798 align:start position:0%
remember how they're not concerned about
 
05:28:05.030 --> 05:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
those things when it's an EA issue thank
 
05:28:08.708 --> 05:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
you much
 
05:28:35.868 --> 05:28:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:39.548 --> 05:28:39.558 align:start position:0%
what yeah you
 
05:29:07.030 --> 05:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:07.040 --> 05:29:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:37.040 --> 05:30:06.948 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:30:06.948 --> 05:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:06.958 --> 05:30:36.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:30:36.910 --> 05:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:36.920 --> 05:31:06.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:31:06.910 --> 05:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:06.920 --> 05:31:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:31:36.830 --> 05:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:36.840 --> 05:32:06.830 align:start position:0%

05:32:06.840 --> 05:32:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:32:36.830 --> 05:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:36.840 --> 05:33:06.750 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:33:06.750 --> 05:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:06.760 --> 05:33:36.708 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:36.718 --> 05:34:06.708 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:06.718 --> 05:34:36.628 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:34:36.628 --> 05:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:36.638 --> 05:35:06.628 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:35:06.628 --> 05:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:06.638 --> 05:35:36.628 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:35:36.628 --> 05:35:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:23.350 --> 05:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go ahead and start
 
05:36:29.708 --> 05:36:29.718 align:start position:0%
this is the last bill for today it's HB
 
05:36:32.190 --> 05:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
491 establishing a committee to study
 
05:36:33.948 --> 05:36:33.958 align:start position:0%
alternative funding methods for public
 
05:36:36.070 --> 05:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
education and how to reduce its Reliance
 
05:36:38.868 --> 05:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
on local real estate property taxes I'd
 
05:36:40.868 --> 05:36:40.878 align:start position:0%
like to welcome representative SPI
 
05:36:44.830 --> 05:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
spillsbury thank you Mr chairman um nice
 
05:36:46.830 --> 05:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
to sit in front of my
 
05:36:50.868 --> 05:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
committee uh batting clean up here I
 
05:36:54.110 --> 05:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
expect this to be a very brief hearing I
 
05:36:55.708 --> 05:36:55.718 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's really a lot of
 
05:36:57.628 --> 05:36:57.638 align:start position:0%
questions necessary to understand what
 
05:36:59.390 --> 05:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
the bill does and I think that the
 
05:37:01.788 --> 05:37:01.798 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether it's necessary
 
05:37:05.350 --> 05:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
or or helpful uh probably should be
 
05:37:08.030 --> 05:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
deferred until we get closer to March
 
05:37:13.190 --> 05:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
20th this is uh a late Bill uh so the
 
05:37:16.670 --> 05:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill is to create a joint
 
05:37:18.990 --> 05:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
committee with members of the house and
 
05:37:19.000 --> 05:37:19.708 align:start position:0%
committee with members of the house and
the

05:37:19.708 --> 05:37:19.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:37:24.070 --> 05:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
Senate not a commission no outside uh
 
05:37:26.948 --> 05:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
interests just members of the
 
05:37:30.190 --> 05:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
legislature balancing the two uh um
 
05:37:32.990 --> 05:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
Chambers as well as uh uh offering a
 
05:37:36.350 --> 05:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
cross-section of perspectives from uh
 
05:37:37.990 --> 05:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
the ways and means that education
 
05:37:40.910 --> 05:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
funding and finance committees now when
 
05:37:44.830 --> 05:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
I put this LSR in uh the decision had
 
05:37:47.390 --> 05:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
not been made yet and I hadn't heard of
 
05:37:51.750 --> 05:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
it to divide uh the education committee
 
05:37:54.070 --> 05:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
and so the the Advent of the education
 
05:37:56.670 --> 05:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
funding committee does go a fair bit of
 
05:37:59.948 --> 05:37:59.958 align:start position:0%
the way towards focusing on funding but
 
05:38:02.628 --> 05:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
when we talk about funding and and I
 
05:38:03.990 --> 05:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
think this has been the case with
 
05:38:05.628 --> 05:38:05.638 align:start position:0%
virtually all of the bills we've heard
 
05:38:08.110 --> 05:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
so far we're talking about
 
05:38:11.150 --> 05:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
how does the state fund the cost of
 
05:38:14.390 --> 05:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
education and assist districts and uh
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
make allowances for various uh uh
 
05:38:19.750 --> 05:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
classifications of students and so on
 
05:38:21.708 --> 05:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
and what I'm getting here to here of
 
05:38:24.310 --> 05:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
course is the uh the sources of the
 
05:38:27.070 --> 05:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
funds um we tend to deal with these
 
05:38:28.310 --> 05:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
issues at
 
05:38:31.230 --> 05:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
hoc and we may have an opportunity to
 
05:38:33.070 --> 05:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
deal with these issues to some extent
 
05:38:36.110 --> 05:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
here in Ed funding but most of our
 
05:38:40.270 --> 05:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
funding bills are our early bills and uh
 
05:38:43.590 --> 05:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
we then rely on our finance Brethren uh
 
05:38:46.350 --> 05:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
to uh you know cook this all up in the
 
05:38:48.590 --> 05:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
budget this is this is really intended
 
05:38:51.390 --> 05:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
to be a vehicle for some more integrated
 
05:38:53.190 --> 05:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
long-term thinking about what our
 
05:38:56.070 --> 05:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
options are so the charge of course
 
05:38:58.788 --> 05:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
comes in lines 11 to 13 under
 
05:39:03.230 --> 05:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
duties funny how Ella um OS took my uh
 
05:39:05.788 --> 05:39:05.798 align:start position:0%
statement and garbled a bit and turned
 
05:39:07.110 --> 05:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
it around backwards so I'm going to read
 
05:39:10.030 --> 05:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
it the way I would to assess the manner
 
05:39:11.788 --> 05:39:11.798 align:start position:0%
in which the state now funds public
 
05:39:13.948 --> 05:39:13.958 align:start position:0%
general education with a specific focus
 
05:39:15.670 --> 05:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
on the impacts of overburdening the
 
05:39:18.830 --> 05:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
local real property tax and make
 
05:39:20.708 --> 05:39:20.718 align:start position:0%
recommendations for rebalancing and
 
05:39:23.150 --> 05:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
changing available Revenue
 
05:39:25.430 --> 05:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
sources now in the minds of some that
 
05:39:25.440 --> 05:39:26.350 align:start position:0%
sources now in the minds of some that
could

05:39:26.350 --> 05:39:26.360 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:39:29.030 --> 05:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
mean an income tax could mean the
 
05:39:31.788 --> 05:39:31.798 align:start position:0%
general sales tax uh it could also mean
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of other things and and the
 
05:39:35.270 --> 05:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
question is can we can we get all the
 
05:39:38.830 --> 05:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
options on the table model them cost
 
05:39:41.430 --> 05:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
them and say okay given the decisions
 
05:39:44.030 --> 05:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
that were made in Ed funding and in uh
 
05:39:47.830 --> 05:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
the and finance and the budget through
 
05:39:50.670 --> 05:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
June what further thinking could this
 
05:39:54.670 --> 05:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
group uh provide uh moving towards
 
05:39:56.788 --> 05:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
November that would lay the foundation
 
05:39:58.628 --> 05:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
for bills that could be introduced in
 
05:40:00.910 --> 05:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
the second year of the session that
 
05:40:05.030 --> 05:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
might rebalance those sources so if we
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
have a very very complicated array of s
 
05:40:09.788 --> 05:40:09.798 align:start position:0%
sources there's a certain percentage
 
05:40:11.910 --> 05:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
that uh is paid into the education trust
 
05:40:14.110 --> 05:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
fund from the business profits tax the
 
05:40:16.628 --> 05:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax there's even a
 
05:40:18.430 --> 05:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
little tiny bit from the meals and rooms
 
05:40:20.310 --> 05:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
tax meals and rooms of course is heavily
 
05:40:21.190 --> 05:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:40:23.590 --> 05:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
Municipal um but there's a lot of money
 
05:40:27.110 --> 05:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
there uh we rely heavily on um the
 
05:40:31.708 --> 05:40:31.718 align:start position:0%
lottery commissions uh earnings and so
 
05:40:37.390 --> 05:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
on if we know what we've decided to fund
 
05:40:41.350 --> 05:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
then what's the best array what what's
 
05:40:43.788 --> 05:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
the best balance to get those funds
 
05:40:46.910 --> 05:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
from I'm not yet convinced that this
 
05:40:48.310 --> 05:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
05:40:50.750 --> 05:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
necessary I'll let you know as we get
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
closer to March 20th I think that
 
05:40:56.270 --> 05:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
there's probably some justif justifiable
 
05:40:58.990 --> 05:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
fears that a a committee like this could
 
05:41:02.110 --> 05:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
go off in a uh you know an unfortunate
 
05:41:04.230 --> 05:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
Direction and I suppose that might be
 
05:41:06.708 --> 05:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion as well and I'm
 
05:41:09.190 --> 05:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
perfectly open to any um you know
 
05:41:11.750 --> 05:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
changes that might tighten up and focus
 
05:41:14.868 --> 05:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
the uh the charge of the committee but I
 
05:41:17.670 --> 05:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
think that we often find ourselves when
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
we sit on our legislative committees
 
05:41:22.670 --> 05:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
reacting to specific bills and proposals
 
05:41:27.708 --> 05:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
and these uh these more comprehensive
 
05:41:30.110 --> 05:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
assessments don't generally get done in
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
that environment so that's why I've
 
05:41:34.030 --> 05:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
brought the bill
 
05:41:36.430 --> 05:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
forward any questions thank you very
 
05:41:38.230 --> 05:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
much other questions from the committee
 
05:41:40.510 --> 05:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire thank you Mr chairman
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
05:41:45.430 --> 05:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
question so the way this reads it would
 
05:41:46.948 --> 05:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
be sort of
 
05:41:51.190 --> 05:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
in okay with this um purpose if you were
 
05:41:53.868 --> 05:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
to say fund the Department of Health and
 
05:41:57.310 --> 05:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
Human Services with property tax and put
 
05:42:01.350 --> 05:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
non-property tax into education but I'm
 
05:42:03.468 --> 05:42:03.478 align:start position:0%
assuming that that's probably not your
 
05:42:05.868 --> 05:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
intention is that correct what what a
 
05:42:08.830 --> 05:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
great question it is not my intention to
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
just simply substitute no I don't think
 
05:42:14.110 --> 05:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
it's any coincidence and I don't think
 
05:42:17.030 --> 05:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's been lost on anybody uh that
 
05:42:19.270 --> 05:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
Charlestown and Newport have been
 
05:42:22.310 --> 05:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
offered by so many people testifying in
 
05:42:24.468 --> 05:42:24.478 align:start position:0%
front of us the last couple of weeks as
 
05:42:27.270 --> 05:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
examples of what's really wrong with the
 
05:42:30.948 --> 05:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
way we raise uh funds for education so
 
05:42:33.150 --> 05:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
we we all know the score generally
 
05:42:36.230 --> 05:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
speaking we're asking real property to
 
05:42:37.708 --> 05:42:37.718 align:start position:0%
do an awful
 
05:42:41.310 --> 05:42:41.320 align:start position:0%
lot to fund municipal government almost
 
05:42:44.750 --> 05:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
entirely to fund County government and
 
05:42:46.510 --> 05:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
to fund
 
05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
education and you know when we have
 
05:42:51.708 --> 05:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
vehicles like the swep
 
05:42:56.030 --> 05:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
tax to be very honest masquerading as a
 
05:42:59.910 --> 05:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
state uh attacks but riding on the on
 
05:42:59.920 --> 05:43:00.788 align:start position:0%
state uh attacks but riding on the on
the

05:43:00.788 --> 05:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:43:03.750 --> 05:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
property we get very anomalous
 
05:43:07.390 --> 05:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
results and so I cannot help myself but
 
05:43:10.310 --> 05:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
to point out again that in Charlestown
 
05:43:13.310 --> 05:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
where you have a real property mow rate
 
05:43:18.430 --> 05:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
of 36.5 one or whatever exactly it is um
 
05:43:21.390 --> 05:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
it just kills the town There's no
 
05:43:23.350 --> 05:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for growth there's no
 
05:43:27.230 --> 05:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to dig the town pull itself
 
05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
s up by the bootstraps into economic
 
05:43:32.948 --> 05:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
Prosperity so there are ways we can deal
 
05:43:34.350 --> 05:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
with that there's actually a multitude
 
05:43:37.350 --> 05:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
of potential Vehicles I've been a strong
 
05:43:39.548 --> 05:43:39.558 align:start position:0%
advocate for reinstating fiscal capacity
 
05:43:41.590 --> 05:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid because I think it's one
 
05:43:45.628 --> 05:43:45.638 align:start position:0%
way to deal with if if the conclusion is
 
05:43:48.990 --> 05:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
we don't want a an income tax or a sales
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
tax um we want to rely on the on the
 
05:43:54.430 --> 05:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
real property tax then I think it
 
05:43:56.430 --> 05:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
becomes important for the state to
 
05:43:59.910 --> 05:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
figure out how to not kill certain parts
 
05:44:02.190 --> 05:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
of the state because it works well for
 
05:44:05.310 --> 05:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
other parts of the state so uh no it is
 
05:44:07.830 --> 05:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
very very much my intention
 
05:44:08.990 --> 05:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
to have a
 
05:44:11.628 --> 05:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
discussion that finds alternative
 
05:44:15.590 --> 05:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
sources to the real property tax and
 
05:44:18.990 --> 05:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:32.750 --> 05:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah it's on thank you um
 
05:44:41.788 --> 05:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:45.190 --> 05:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
your feeling
 
05:44:49.948 --> 05:44:49.958 align:start position:0%
that we would gain from having a an
 
05:44:53.230 --> 05:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
entity like this uh charged specifically
 
05:44:55.030 --> 05:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
with trying
 
05:44:59.868 --> 05:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
to break through the impath that we've
 
05:45:02.868 --> 05:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
been struggling with for so long and not
 
05:45:07.670 --> 05:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
been able to find our way through um
 
05:45:12.750 --> 05:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
and so I welcome that um I think that I
 
05:45:15.708 --> 05:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
know and we we all know that on the
 
05:45:18.670 --> 05:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
table right now we've got a slew of
 
05:45:20.788 --> 05:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
proposals that we're going to be looking
 
05:45:22.430 --> 05:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
at in the next few
 
05:45:25.390 --> 05:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
weeks um and maybe we'll make Headway
 
05:45:26.350 --> 05:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
maybe we
 
05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
won't I think if we uh make Headway then
 
05:45:33.150 --> 05:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
we can set this aside and that's what
 
05:45:38.788 --> 05:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
you said um I think if uh more likely
 
05:45:38.798 --> 05:45:40.430 align:start position:0%
you said um I think if uh more likely
were

05:45:40.430 --> 05:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:45:44.070 --> 05:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
still struggling with this um this could
 
05:45:47.070 --> 05:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
be helpful I'd want to be reassured that
 
05:45:48.670 --> 05:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
it would
 
05:45:52.190 --> 05:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
be um sort of Above The Fray a group of
 
05:45:54.150 --> 05:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
people who really would look at this and
 
05:45:57.910 --> 05:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
not be uh consumed by
 
05:46:03.390 --> 05:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
partisanship um and um I think that
 
05:46:06.590 --> 05:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh the appointing authority needs to
 
05:46:09.430 --> 05:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
be specified in here I didn't see
 
05:46:13.150 --> 05:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
any any language here about who
 
05:46:16.030 --> 05:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
appoints um and
 
05:46:20.468 --> 05:46:20.478 align:start position:0%
um the uh as you pointed out uh this was
 
05:46:22.548 --> 05:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
written and
 
05:46:26.110 --> 05:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
filed perhaps uh contemporaneously with
 
05:46:28.270 --> 05:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
the decision to split the education
 
05:46:31.468 --> 05:46:31.478 align:start position:0%
committee or just after or just before
 
05:46:33.350 --> 05:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh in any event it refers to the
 
05:46:36.070 --> 05:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
education committee and that has
 
05:46:38.390 --> 05:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
addressed and
 
05:46:41.110 --> 05:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
um and maybe the numbers need to be
 
05:46:43.270 --> 05:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
changed a bit because the Ways and Means
 
05:46:45.910 --> 05:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
Committee is a different role and
 
05:46:47.788 --> 05:46:47.798 align:start position:0%
education funding committee has a
 
05:46:50.548 --> 05:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
greater role than before at least than
 
05:46:52.788 --> 05:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
education committee had before so we got
 
05:46:55.310 --> 05:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
to figure those things out one member
 
05:46:57.628 --> 05:46:57.638 align:start position:0%
from the finance committee gets us into
 
05:47:01.948 --> 05:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
this partisan issue uh you know um
 
05:47:06.390 --> 05:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
unless there's some person who really
 
05:47:09.670 --> 05:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees is fantastic can can
 
05:47:12.548 --> 05:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
deal with the with the substance of the
 
05:47:18.030 --> 05:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
issue uh credibly um so yeah we need all
 
05:47:20.070 --> 05:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
the help we can get and if we can have a
 
05:47:23.030 --> 05:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
leading entity that digs into this
 
05:47:26.788 --> 05:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
incredibly complicated problem um that
 
05:47:30.708 --> 05:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
is uh plaguing us in our school
 
05:47:33.110 --> 05:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
districts and our local municipalities
 
05:47:35.910 --> 05:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
because uh you know it doesn't is not
 
05:47:37.548 --> 05:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
working well right now now so the
 
05:47:39.590 --> 05:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
property tax is carrying too much of a
 
05:47:42.510 --> 05:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
burden so people are sort of kicking out
 
05:47:46.270 --> 05:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
from that that problem and uh that's not
 
05:47:50.830 --> 05:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
always healthy um so uh so let's hang on
 
05:47:54.788 --> 05:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
to this and uh and do what we feel we
 
05:47:58.030 --> 05:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
have to do in a few weeks um that's well
 
05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
I I I share your sentiments and I'm
 
05:48:02.190 --> 05:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
receptive to all the ideas app pointing
 
05:48:04.548 --> 05:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
Authority the the representational
 
05:48:06.150 --> 05:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
balance all those things to me are open
 
05:48:06.160 --> 05:48:08.990 align:start position:0%
balance all those things to me are open
questions

05:48:08.990 --> 05:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:12.310 --> 05:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
I I I have a question just mulling over
 
05:48:15.270 --> 05:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh what I think I hear here coming here
 
05:48:16.548 --> 05:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
you know yeah we're going to be looking
 
05:48:18.910 --> 05:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
at all the different bills that we have
 
05:48:21.270 --> 05:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
and looking at fiscal capacity vers this
 
05:48:24.030 --> 05:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
this this and this but is there
 
05:48:25.868 --> 05:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
something else that's lacking in this
 
05:48:28.390 --> 05:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
equation is the fact we're not looking
 
05:48:30.430 --> 05:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
at the organization or structure or
 
05:48:33.910 --> 05:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
governance of our education in this
 
05:48:38.070 --> 05:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
state to know then how what the end
 
05:48:40.390 --> 05:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
result is and how we're going to get
 
05:48:42.430 --> 05:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
there rather than looking at here's
 
05:48:45.708 --> 05:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
where it comes from but how's it going
 
05:48:47.788 --> 05:48:47.798 align:start position:0%
to be used and how are we going to
 
05:48:49.590 --> 05:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're using it in the most
 
05:48:53.868 --> 05:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
cost efficient way so structure
 
05:48:56.270 --> 05:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
organization and how we govern
 
05:48:58.788 --> 05:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
governance I think are also part of that
 
05:49:00.230 --> 05:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
equation if you're going to really come
 
05:49:01.628 --> 05:49:01.638 align:start position:0%
out with an outcome that's going to be a
 
05:49:01.638 --> 05:49:04.788 align:start position:0%
out with an outcome that's going to be a
lasting

05:49:04.788 --> 05:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:06.750 --> 05:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
outcome they're all part of the same
 
05:49:06.760 --> 05:49:07.628 align:start position:0%
outcome they're all part of the same
same

05:49:07.628 --> 05:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
same
 
05:49:11.270 --> 05:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
Cosmos um and and separating them is
 
05:49:14.990 --> 05:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
difficult but on the other hand if we uh
 
05:49:16.830 --> 05:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
pose the question in a way that's too
 
05:49:19.868 --> 05:49:19.878 align:start position:0%
diffuse then we don't end up focusing
 
05:49:22.948 --> 05:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
and and getting a change in terms of the
 
05:49:24.750 --> 05:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
impact on those communities that
 
05:49:26.548 --> 05:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
struggle with exceptionally High real
 
05:49:30.030 --> 05:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
property tax so while I agree with you
 
05:49:34.350 --> 05:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
um I I I can't imagine how we conquer
 
05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
the spending uh side of the equation uh
 
05:49:41.350 --> 05:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
as a precondition to dealing with what
 
05:49:44.788 --> 05:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
our you know Fair sources are U the
 
05:49:46.868 --> 05:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
deliberate a session in my uh uh
 
05:49:48.350 --> 05:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
charlestown's District which is Fall
 
05:49:51.110 --> 05:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
Mountain occurred on Wednesday night we
 
05:49:53.030 --> 05:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh finally after several years of
 
05:49:56.548 --> 05:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
discussion uh uh authorized a budget
 
05:49:58.990 --> 05:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
Committee in 2022 the budget committee
 
05:50:01.390 --> 05:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
is just uh they were picking up stride
 
05:50:02.990 --> 05:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the first year and this is their
 
05:50:05.310 --> 05:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
third uh they came in with a budget that
 
05:50:09.310 --> 05:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
was lower than the default rate a mere
 
05:50:11.548 --> 05:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
$179,000 lower than what the school
 
05:50:13.910 --> 05:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
board wanted and lo and behold at the
 
05:50:16.230 --> 05:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
deliberative former School Board member
 
05:50:18.628 --> 05:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
former uh business administrator for the
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
district got up and made a motion to
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
raise the budget to the school board's
 
05:50:27.670 --> 05:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
level thoroughly undermining the efforts
 
05:50:29.230 --> 05:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
of the budget committee I mean these
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
Dynamics are are in many ways so beyond
 
05:50:31.920 --> 05:50:33.750 align:start position:0%
Dynamics are are in many ways so beyond
our

05:50:33.750 --> 05:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:50:37.310 --> 05:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
control but I I think that uh
 
05:50:39.468 --> 05:50:39.478 align:start position:0%
the state has traditionally made a
 
05:50:45.110 --> 05:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
qualitative judgment that local spending
 
05:50:47.190 --> 05:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
and local funding should be tied
 
05:50:49.270 --> 05:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
together and I think that's historically
 
05:50:52.310 --> 05:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
why it's become the practice to rely on
 
05:50:56.990 --> 05:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
on real estate but the real estate tax
 
05:50:59.350 --> 05:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
at least in communities like the ones I
 
05:51:01.948 --> 05:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
represent is just been given too heavy a
 
05:51:04.390 --> 05:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
lift and I think that one of the things
 
05:51:06.628 --> 05:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
that plagues the entire discussion of
 
05:51:08.510 --> 05:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
education funding in the state of New
 
05:51:11.548 --> 05:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that when people say we
 
05:51:14.430 --> 05:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
aren't adequately funding education or
 
05:51:16.430 --> 05:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
we aren't providing enough funds for an
 
05:51:19.708 --> 05:51:19.718 align:start position:0%
adequate education they're not saying
 
05:51:21.548 --> 05:51:21.558 align:start position:0%
we're not spending
 
05:51:24.030 --> 05:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
enough they're saying we don't like
 
05:51:26.910 --> 05:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
where it's coming from we don't like the
 
05:51:30.390 --> 05:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
pain it inflicts um in terms of our
 
05:51:34.310 --> 05:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
property tax okay so where my district
 
05:51:36.948 --> 05:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
has $23,800
 
05:51:39.070 --> 05:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
average all-in cost per student that's
 
05:51:40.670 --> 05:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
baking in everything special ed
 
05:51:42.430 --> 05:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
transportation and so
 
05:51:44.990 --> 05:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
on I don't think I haven't heard anybody
 
05:51:48.830 --> 05:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
in my district say that $23,800 is
 
05:51:52.190 --> 05:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
insufficient to fund the education so
 
05:51:54.910 --> 05:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
this adequate education thing is really
 
05:51:56.990 --> 05:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
code for
 
05:52:00.390 --> 05:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
saying you know it's too much coming
 
05:52:03.070 --> 05:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
from the the property tax and likewise
 
05:52:05.150 --> 05:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
when people say the state isn't
 
05:52:05.160 --> 05:52:06.750 align:start position:0%
when people say the state isn't
assisting

05:52:06.750 --> 05:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
assisting
 
05:52:08.948 --> 05:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
they're saying the state isn't taking it
 
05:52:11.910 --> 05:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
off the property tax and unfortunately
 
05:52:14.190 --> 05:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
swept doesn't take it off the property
 
05:52:16.590 --> 05:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
tax it adds it back on so these are
 
05:52:18.830 --> 05:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
complex discussions that's why I'm
 
05:52:21.990 --> 05:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
thinking a committee like this could be
 
05:52:24.390 --> 05:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
helpful are the
 
05:52:27.990 --> 05:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions paron me I think oh I I I saw
 
05:52:31.430 --> 05:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
one here and one then represent fellows
 
05:52:37.628 --> 05:52:37.638 align:start position:0%
after po papich thank you um so
 
05:52:39.310 --> 05:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
it was my turn right because I jumped
 
05:52:42.468 --> 05:52:42.478 align:start position:0%
the gun already once I don't want to I I
 
05:52:44.830 --> 05:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
saw represent McGuire with his hand like
 
05:52:47.190 --> 05:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
this I thought he had his hand up it's
 
05:52:48.150 --> 05:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
pointing to
 
05:52:50.510 --> 05:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
VI yeah okay
 
05:52:53.310 --> 05:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you I I'm just trying not to
 
05:52:58.430 --> 05:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:02.830 --> 05:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
um your committee is supposed to only
 
05:53:03.990 --> 05:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
look at
 
05:53:06.788 --> 05:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
Revenue am I understanding this as you
 
05:53:09.830 --> 05:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
thinking that the right way to fix our
 
05:53:13.468 --> 05:53:13.478 align:start position:0%
school funding issues is to start by bu
 
05:53:15.270 --> 05:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
budgeting Revenue based on the way we
 
05:53:15.280 --> 05:53:20.590 align:start position:0%
budgeting Revenue based on the way we
are

05:53:20.590 --> 05:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:22.830 --> 05:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
spending I'm I'm going to try to
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
interpret your question because I'm not
 
05:53:25.948 --> 05:53:25.958 align:start position:0%
totally certain I got it but it's
 
05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
ordinarily the case in the legislature
 
05:53:30.948 --> 05:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
that we ask the Ways and Means Committee
 
05:53:34.190 --> 05:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
to do Revenue estimates they basically
 
05:53:36.868 --> 05:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
bring a resolution to the floor with we
 
05:53:39.910 --> 05:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
basically op adopt a resolution that
 
05:53:41.948 --> 05:53:41.958 align:start position:0%
says here's what we believe we can work
 
05:53:43.708 --> 05:53:43.718 align:start position:0%
with and then the finance committee goes
 
05:53:46.390 --> 05:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
to work trying to allocate the spending
 
05:53:49.670 --> 05:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
within that um you know that's fine but
 
05:53:51.788 --> 05:53:51.798 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the committee is to think
 
05:53:54.510 --> 05:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
more long-term conceptually about what
 
05:53:56.750 --> 05:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
changes to the revenue either new
 
05:53:59.868 --> 05:53:59.878 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue or or or changes of
 
05:54:03.510 --> 05:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
allocation so this is I think perhaps
 
05:54:05.190 --> 05:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
more an example of
 
05:54:07.788 --> 05:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
saying what what is it that we think
 
05:54:10.310 --> 05:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
that the state should provide and get
 
05:54:12.670 --> 05:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
that nailed down and and get the budget
 
05:54:16.070 --> 05:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
established and then say now given that
 
05:54:18.628 --> 05:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
where's the most appropriate place to to
 
05:54:22.270 --> 05:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
go find it and I just make a comment um
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
I think one of the deepest takeaways uh
 
05:54:29.830 --> 05:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
for me out of two terms on the Ways and
 
05:54:35.030 --> 05:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
Means Committee is um you can tax almost
 
05:54:39.310 --> 05:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
anything to a degree but when you when
 
05:54:42.868 --> 05:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
you tax it more and more you start to
 
05:54:45.070 --> 05:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
really uh affect
 
05:54:48.030 --> 05:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
behavior and and if you think about the
 
05:54:51.510 --> 05:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
criticism of income taxes that's largely
 
05:54:55.030 --> 05:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
what they often Center on uh does it
 
05:54:57.910 --> 05:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
create um all kinds of incentives that
 
05:54:59.628 --> 05:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
would be entirely different in a
 
05:55:02.190 --> 05:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
completely free market situation but
 
05:55:04.230 --> 05:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's true of every tax that's why
 
05:55:07.590 --> 05:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
syntaxes are so popular right so that at
 
05:55:11.150 --> 05:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
least some of the support for taxing uh
 
05:55:15.230 --> 05:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
gaming and tobacco and even marijuana if
 
05:55:18.110 --> 05:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
it was legalized is that notion that
 
05:55:21.030 --> 05:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
when you tax something you discourage
 
05:55:26.110 --> 05:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
it well we tax real estate more than we
 
05:55:29.230 --> 05:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
tax anything else and when we do that
 
05:55:31.670 --> 05:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
when we take that Beyond a reasonable
 
05:55:34.990 --> 05:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
point maybe even to a breaking point we
 
05:55:37.830 --> 05:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
affect Behavior in enormous ways that
 
05:55:39.868 --> 05:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
are not well understood across the state
 
05:55:42.350 --> 05:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
I don't see a lot of analysis coming out
 
05:55:44.390 --> 05:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
of fiscal policy Institute about it I
 
05:55:46.468 --> 05:55:46.478 align:start position:0%
don't see it really coming out of the
 
05:55:48.310 --> 05:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
legislature and I think one of the
 
05:55:51.190 --> 05:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
reasons you don't see that analysis is
 
05:55:54.310 --> 05:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
because the impact is so vastly
 
05:55:56.750 --> 05:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
different from one Community to another
 
05:55:58.868 --> 05:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
that it's very difficult to generalize
 
05:56:01.788 --> 05:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
across the state but the communities
 
05:56:04.830 --> 05:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
that are okay with with the property tax
 
05:56:06.750 --> 05:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
have to start to consider really
 
05:56:10.548 --> 05:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
damaging effect to the communities that
 
05:56:13.548 --> 05:56:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:17.990 --> 05:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
situation represent fellows um I think
 
05:56:21.110 --> 05:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
this is a great idea and I'm wondering
 
05:56:24.150 --> 05:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
to make it a question if you were aware
 
05:56:26.910 --> 05:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
that the last time anything like this
 
05:56:30.110 --> 05:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
happened that I'm aware of was about 26
 
05:56:34.590 --> 05:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
years ago and it was a commission that
 
05:56:36.708 --> 05:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
the governor at the time put together
 
05:56:38.990 --> 05:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
this was back when we got the Claremont
 
05:56:41.590 --> 05:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
ruling just you know just before
 
05:56:46.230 --> 05:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
2000 and I've I've read that report and
 
05:56:49.390 --> 05:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that struck me was
 
05:56:53.230 --> 05:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
that the the models that they talked
 
05:56:55.750 --> 05:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
about and the you know you know the
 
05:56:57.350 --> 05:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
different characteristics of the
 
05:57:00.628 --> 05:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
different Revenue sources is vastly
 
05:57:02.948 --> 05:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
different today for some of them than it
 
05:57:05.590 --> 05:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
was 20 years ago I think probably we
 
05:57:08.030 --> 05:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
will see that the property tax will be
 
05:57:10.708 --> 05:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
vastly different just because of the
 
05:57:13.990 --> 05:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
whole change since the internet so I'm
 
05:57:15.150 --> 05:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
just wonder if
 
05:57:18.110 --> 05:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
you thinking that that might kind of be
 
05:57:21.430 --> 05:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
a model for what you are thinking of
 
05:57:22.948 --> 05:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
well I'm not aware of that study and I
 
05:57:25.190 --> 05:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate your institutional uh
 
05:57:27.830 --> 05:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge um I just know that in the
 
05:57:30.310 --> 05:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
Horizon that I've been focusing on it I
 
05:57:34.190 --> 05:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:39.430 --> 05:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:41.468 --> 05:57:41.478 align:start position:0%
Burton uh thank you for taking my
 
05:57:43.390 --> 05:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman I'm the
 
05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
only one in this room that witnessed the
 
05:57:51.670 --> 05:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
solution 40 years ago and we devised a
 
05:57:54.430 --> 05:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
plan for what we should pay but we
 
05:57:57.270 --> 05:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
didn't have the number we needed and so
 
05:57:59.390 --> 05:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
when Governor sonunu said I'm not going
 
05:58:00.430 --> 05:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
to put up
 
05:58:04.750 --> 05:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
8% of the of of the school costs it all
 
05:58:08.110 --> 05:58:08.120 align:start position:0%
fell apart the Supreme Court had agreed
 
05:58:11.070 --> 05:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
with the formula we had devised it's a
 
05:58:13.910 --> 05:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort I talked to the woman
 
05:58:15.510 --> 05:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
I co-chaired the committee with the
 
05:58:19.468 --> 05:58:19.478 align:start position:0%
other day um this bill does
 
05:58:22.788 --> 05:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
not get at what it should cost for an
 
05:58:25.270 --> 05:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
education it just gets away it just gets
 
05:58:29.230 --> 05:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
at what my question is Mr chairman um
 
05:58:31.150 --> 05:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is not get at the cost of
 
05:58:33.830 --> 05:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
Education it only gets at the way we
 
05:58:37.468 --> 05:58:37.478 align:start position:0%
could spread the costs is that correct
 
05:58:39.628 --> 05:58:39.638 align:start position:0%
that is correct and I I think we've been
 
05:58:41.990 --> 05:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
blessed with a proliferation of bills
 
05:58:44.788 --> 05:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
that give us an opportunity already to
 
05:58:49.070 --> 05:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
focus on the spending side this gets at
 
05:58:53.350 --> 05:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
the the sourcing side oh my me f the
 
05:58:55.868 --> 05:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
question would you believe um I think
 
05:58:58.510 --> 05:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
you're putting a cart after the horse we
 
05:59:00.510 --> 05:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
need to decide on what we're going to
 
05:59:02.788 --> 05:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
spend on education then figure out how
 
05:59:05.830 --> 05:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
to pay for it and if you do you repeat
 
05:59:08.670 --> 05:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
his like we did it'll
 
05:59:11.150 --> 05:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
fail I I think you've said the same
 
05:59:14.110 --> 05:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
thing that I did not you did no I'm oh
 
05:59:16.150 --> 05:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
okay no I didn't to take I think that
 
05:59:18.708 --> 05:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
the committee in coming weeks will be
 
05:59:20.510 --> 05:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
deciding what the spending side looks
 
05:59:22.070 --> 05:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
like and I think this gets to the
 
05:59:24.350 --> 05:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
sourcing side thank you further
 
05:59:26.468 --> 05:59:26.478 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
05:59:29.190 --> 05:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
kcom when you're talking spending side
 
05:59:31.708 --> 05:59:31.718 align:start position:0%
are you talking about our spending side
 
05:59:33.110 --> 05:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
as to how we're funding it or the
 
05:59:35.868 --> 05:59:35.878 align:start position:0%
school's spending side as to what they
 
05:59:37.510 --> 05:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
think think they should be spending for
 
05:59:38.868 --> 05:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
an adequate
 
05:59:41.430 --> 05:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
education good question glad to clarify
 
05:59:43.430 --> 05:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
no I mean what I'm really speaking about
 
05:59:45.548 --> 05:59:45.558 align:start position:0%
is the decisions that this committee and
 
05:59:47.590 --> 05:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature is being asked to make
 
05:59:51.230 --> 05:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
to expend State funds uh to assist those
 
05:59:53.110 --> 05:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
districts I'm not talking about the
 
05:59:55.548 --> 05:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
budget uh uh process within the
 
05:59:57.468 --> 05:59:57.478 align:start position:0%
districts thanks can I have a followup
 
05:59:57.478 --> 05:59:59.110 align:start position:0%
districts thanks can I have a followup
please

05:59:59.110 --> 05:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
please
 
06:00:01.270 --> 06:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
yes I like the idea of the study
 
06:00:05.190 --> 06:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
committee would you would you consider
 
06:00:06.590 --> 06:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
putting in here
 
06:00:10.468 --> 06:00:10.478 align:start position:0%
also um the ability if we're going to be
 
06:00:11.910 --> 06:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
looking at our funding and how we're
 
06:00:13.230 --> 06:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
going to fund the
 
06:00:15.430 --> 06:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
schools and we're going to Define I'm
 
06:00:19.070 --> 06:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
assuming um through this sorry what the
 
06:00:22.030 --> 06:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
adequate education um categories will be
 
06:00:25.110 --> 06:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
right would you consider putting in the
 
06:00:27.190 --> 06:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
the ability for us to also control some
 
06:00:29.948 --> 06:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
of those expenses so that way when we're
 
06:00:31.750 --> 06:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
looking at a Statewide what is an
 
06:00:34.708 --> 06:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
adequate education cost on average we
 
06:00:36.270 --> 06:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
have something that's pretty even
 
06:00:38.150 --> 06:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and then any of the
 
06:00:39.708 --> 06:00:39.718 align:start position:0%
extraordinary things that the school
 
06:00:42.070 --> 06:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
districts want to buy or want to do or
 
06:00:43.270 --> 06:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
things that they believe will help in
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
the education that that can be voted on
 
06:00:47.350 --> 06:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
locally and then those people are
 
06:00:50.548 --> 06:00:50.558 align:start position:0%
responsible for those um because I feel
 
06:00:52.230 --> 06:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
strongly that we're kind of letting
 
06:00:54.628 --> 06:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
people just have a blank check and then
 
06:00:56.868 --> 06:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
expecting us to fund it and it's up to
 
06:00:58.788 --> 06:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
the voters and and a lot of Voters in my
 
06:01:00.468 --> 06:01:00.478 align:start position:0%
area think that throwing more money at
 
06:01:02.430 --> 06:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
the school is going to give us better
 
06:01:05.310 --> 06:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
results um and I'm just of the mindset
 
06:01:07.110 --> 06:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
saying if we're going to do this maybe
 
06:01:09.070 --> 06:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
we should be looking at controlling some
 
06:01:10.150 --> 06:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
of those
 
06:01:13.070 --> 06:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
costs so that we can buy better the
 
06:01:16.948 --> 06:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
answer is yes to a degree I I think that
 
06:01:19.110 --> 06:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
whenever you uh are talking about
 
06:01:20.948 --> 06:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
sources and you say okay we're going to
 
06:01:22.990 --> 06:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
tax this or we're going to allocate a
 
06:01:25.390 --> 06:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
portion of that tax to the education
 
06:01:29.270 --> 06:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
trust fund it's certainly fair game to
 
06:01:32.110 --> 06:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
determine whether there are conditions
 
06:01:34.310 --> 06:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
and limitations that would be coupled
 
06:01:37.270 --> 06:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
with that to make it um palatable and I
 
06:01:40.270 --> 06:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
mean palatable just in a judgmental uh
 
06:01:43.350 --> 06:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
context but also as a political matter
 
06:01:46.070 --> 06:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
so I I I yes to a degree I think that's
 
06:01:46.080 --> 06:02:04.830 align:start position:0%
so I I I yes to a degree I think that's
fair

06:02:04.830 --> 06:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:04.840 --> 06:02:34.830 align:start position:0%
