morning
 
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
what our procedures are is that we
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
basically mute ourselves
 
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
and if we have questions we raise our
 
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.270 align:start position:0%
and if we have questions we raise our
hand

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
and then i will call on
 
00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 align:start position:0%
people in the order that they have
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
raised their hands
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
most of the time sometimes i miss it but
 
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
everybody everybody that wants to say
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
something uh
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity to do that so
 
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
um mickey sent out some documents last
 
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.629 align:start position:0%
um mickey sent out some documents last
night

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
night
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
and i guess they overwhelmed my computer
 
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
okay everybody got them i'm
 
00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be switching between the um
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
the website and um what mickey's doing
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
so if uh mickey if you could um
 
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
i think you've got this in a good order
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
and that we will um go forward
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
with the order that you have identified
 
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
so if we could please go ahead sure i
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
think i'm gonna ask andrea to share the
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
screen again
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh this worked pretty well uh in our
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
previous work sessions and i think
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps we start with the house bill 2
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
tracking document which is the
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
portrait there we go portrait oriented
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
schedule that shows everything that was
 
00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2 assigned to us
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
as well as some new amendments proposed
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
as well as the division's
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
actions to date so representative murray
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
did you just want to go in order
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
just right through or is there anything
 
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
no i think we can just go in order and
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
if there are
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
um you know if they're questions or we
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
want to pass over something
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
we can do that and then um
 
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
we can figure out
 
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
at the end where we are okay and
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
so please and i think that it's a
 
00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:22.870 align:start position:0%
so please and i think that it's a
logical

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
logical
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
um a logical approach to uh
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
what we uh what we need to do today okay
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
so in that case the first uh section
 
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
of house bill 2 i would point to is on
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
page 22 sections 45 and 46
 
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
and this is relative to the calculation
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
of adequate education grants
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
if you recall the governor had
 
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.990 align:start position:0%
if you recall the governor had
recommended

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
change for the biennium that would
 
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.029 align:start position:0%
change for the biennium that would
essentially

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
lift up the free and reduced lunch adm
 
00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.189 align:start position:0%

those counts being uh reported to the

um i have no amendments to make any
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
changes to this
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
and as you know the amounts appropriated
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
in the budget align with this uh
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
change in the estimates provided by the
 
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:27.589 align:start position:0%
change in the estimates provided by the
department

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
mickey what is this called on the
 
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.029 align:start position:0%
mickey what is this called on the
website

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
so if you're on the website the i think
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's called hb2
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
tracking sheet okay
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%

the uh so there's uh hb there's a budget
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure transfer
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
yep so the next one is uh um relative to
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
sections 48 through 50 in house bill 2
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
and we have amendment 0957h
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
and this is the first amendment in the
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 amendment packet that was
 
00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:25.590 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 amendment packet that was
sent

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
sent
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
out thank you andrea so this amendment
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
essentially does
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
three things the first if you recall the
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
recommended transferring 15 million
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
dollars a year from the education trust
 
00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:39.350 align:start position:0%
dollars a year from the education trust
fund

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
to the public school infrastructure fund
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
this section and
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment in section 48 reduces
 
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
that amount to 1 million dollars for a
 
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.670 align:start position:0%
that amount to 1 million dollars for a
year

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
effectively freeing up 14 million a year
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
for other uses
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
the next item that this amendment
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
affects is
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
under current law the public school
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of this biennium fiscal 21
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget had kicked that
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
date out for two years
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
because of the recommendation of adding
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
more money to the fund this amendment if
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see online yeah line 17
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
that perspective repeal is repealed
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
therefore there is no
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
statutory end date to this fund
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this amendment so there
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
would be no deadline to expend the funds
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
or anything like that
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
and the last change right above that on
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
lines 13 through 16
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
is language that essentially says that
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
in order to be eligible for a grant a
 
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.230 align:start position:0%
in order to be eligible for a grant a
school

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
it needs to be determined that the
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
school did not have
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
any federal stimulus dollars available
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
to it to meet the needs that they're
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
from the public school infrastructure
 
00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.430 align:start position:0%
from the public school infrastructure
fund

00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
this would be something the commission
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the department
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
grant

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
tackle them individually because it is
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
i guess i call it a package so
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
if we could do that i would uh i would
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%

we'll stick with row one
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
so this is the reduction to the public
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund that we
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%

could okay
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
sure so so the um the next item on here
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
does not have a house bill to
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation this would be a house bill
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
1 section
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
or as house bill 1 change to the line
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
for a special education aid in the
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
department of education's budget
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative umberger has a proposal
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
to increase the aid
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
in this program to fund what is the
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
estimated full
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
um reimbursement without proration
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
for the the special education aid
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
program formerly known as the
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid program
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh so andrea has the page up there
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
currently in the the budget as
 
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.070 align:start position:0%
currently in the the budget as
introduced

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
there's 30.8 million dollars per year
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
you'll see the proposed
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
increase per year that would uh
 
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.669 align:start position:0%
increase per year that would uh
hopefully

00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%

million dollars to the general fund

that uh we can
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
fund the items that are in the
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
next group is that correct mickey
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
that's correct so um based on all the
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
items that you do have before you today
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
this would be the transfer required to

this would be the transfer required to
essentially

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
um madam chair um we did identify
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
i believe um the the two in the criminal
 
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.389 align:start position:0%
i believe um the the two in the criminal
lab

00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
lab
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
or the um forensic lab i guess it's
 
00:30:55.279 --> 00:30:56.389 align:start position:0%
or the um forensic lab i guess it's
called

00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay and then one would be
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
um oh mickey help me i'm forgetting what
 
00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:03.269 align:start position:0%
um oh mickey help me i'm forgetting what
the

00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh the position is so
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
andrea has the uh the chain sheet there
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
so these three positions are scattered
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
across three different accounting units
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
so one's in the uh the urine codis lab
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
one is in the
 
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
toxicology lab and one's in the forensic
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
lab as far as budgeting purposes
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
so you can see those on your screen
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
right now and
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%

change does have two rows on that
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
previous sheet so there is a
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
general fund impact and a highway fund
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
impact just because of the nature of
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%

is a program that i really like
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the robotics program
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
for the high schools uh falls into that
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
into that same category i know we had

not talked about it
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
um i but i i hope
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
that we can get
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
agreement that the robotics program
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
is essential to our
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
our students within the state

sheet we have the student data system

no no we'll do the uh student
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
information data system
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
software costs it's not really software
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
cost it's
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
operational costs i guess but that's
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay call it what we want
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
um we had initially
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
i think right voted to take this money
 
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:40.870 align:start position:0%
i think right voted to take this money
out

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
or we just were not supportive of it
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's not currently in the governor's
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
recommended budget and at first
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
there were really no amendments to add
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
the money
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
but we had a recent discussion with the
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
department on monday
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
and so their first their initial uh
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
we're able to modify that to one and a
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay are there any comments
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%

yeah um i will
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i think i'll have to vote
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
no on this not so much that i don't
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
think it's needed i just simply
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh being parachuted onto this committee
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
recently it's just something i don't
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
know enough
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
about to vote in the affirmative it's so
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
just so everybody knows it's not that i
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
don't want it or
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
i just don't know enough about it so i
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
want to get that out there
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any other
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none um
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
could i have a motion to
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
put 1.5 million in
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 into the
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:18.839 --> 00:41:23.670 align:start position:0%
 
costs

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
don't all talk at once
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay i don't seem to have a motion on
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
that so we will
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay the next item is to increase the
 
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.550 align:start position:0%
okay the next item is to increase the
funding

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
for the community college and us
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
so we do have a detailed change sheet
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
for this item and
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
okay can she have that up and she can
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
there we go so currently in the
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh agency number 78 is established as
 
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:20.870 align:start position:0%
uh agency number 78 is established as
the

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
collet community college and university
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
system this motion here
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
would break the college the community
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
college system and the university system
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
back to their own separate
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
agency code in the operating budget as
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
well as
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
fund um usnh at 88.5 million dollars per
 
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:38.950 align:start position:0%
fund um usnh at 88.5 million dollars per
year

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the community college system at 56
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay and this this all okay so you said
 
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.829 align:start position:0%
okay and this this all okay so you said
this

00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.839 --> 00:42:59.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
so we should we sh the motion on the
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
floor i guess should be
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
approve zero not zero nine
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
oh we did that yeah we've done we've
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
done uh
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
zero nine so this really is just a house
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill one
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
change and that's that change sheet
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's on the screen right now
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
so these all these would just be uh
 
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:22.950 align:start position:0%
so these all these would just be uh
appropriations

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
in the budget document itself not we've
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
we've already kind of affected
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
this with e2 with the representative
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and this would essentially
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
line up the with that amendment as well
 
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:34.470 align:start position:0%
line up the with that amendment as well
as

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
change the funding levels for uh over
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
the biennium increase by 11 million
 
00:43:38.839 --> 00:43:40.470 align:start position:0%
the biennium increase by 11 million
dollars

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%

that this um amendment
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
would level fund both institutions
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
and continue to keep their budget
 
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.550 align:start position:0%
and continue to keep their budget

00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
we do have a couple highway fund related
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 1 items
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
so the three lab positions we've already
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
approved that
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
on row 12 of the tracking document the
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
next item we have
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
um relates to winter maintenance so as
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
you recall
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
our highway fund position at this point
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
through all the actions taken is about
 
00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.150 align:start position:0%
through all the actions taken is about
uh

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
1.6 million dollars um in the deficit
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
from from our target of balancing so
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
this item here
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
to reduce winter maintenance would uh
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
result in a
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
balanced highway fund budget out of
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
division two
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
and this was a line that had been
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
previously discussed
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
in a work session to um to change to do
 
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:11.589 align:start position:0%
in a work session to um to change to do
so

00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
is there any are there any questions
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
comments and care
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
yes please um mickey could you clarify
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
that again um what is the impact
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
so in the uh in the budget right now um
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance is kind of funded at
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
a pretty healthy level compared to
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
previous budgets
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
yes this um item here would reduce
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance appropriations by 875
 
00:46:48.319 --> 00:46:48.870 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance appropriations by 875
000

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
a year of highway fund appropriations uh
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
as before you consider this action the
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
highway fund right now
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
budget and division two is in deficit by
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
about 1.6 million dollars
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
this was the approach that was discussed
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
earlier in division
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
as an area to take a reduction to be
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
able to balance the highway fund
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
the department of transportation has the
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
authority statutorily
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
and has exercised it many times before
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to come to fiscal
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
if winters are bad and they do need
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
additional funds above what's budgeted
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
um that was also part of the discuss the
 
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:23.990 align:start position:0%
um that was also part of the discuss the
discussion

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
on why this would be an area to
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
potentially reduce
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mickey are there any further
 
00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.430 align:start position:0%
thank you mickey are there any further
questions

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
one uh one of the things that we have to
 
00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.349 align:start position:0%
one uh one of the things that we have to
do

00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
no matter what is balance all of our um
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
trust funds oh they're not trust funds
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
or whatever the highway fund
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
the uh fishing game etc so
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
um this was our way
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
of accomplishing that for the highway
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
fund and
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully everyone can support this
 
00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.390 align:start position:0%
hopefully everyone can support this
unless

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
unless
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
mary's money tree has
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
a million six in it
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
right representative murray
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%

00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
reconfirm
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
that um transportation is fine with us
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
and let's pray we don't get another
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes transportation is
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
okay with this obviously
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
obviously they would like us not to do
 
00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.030 align:start position:0%
obviously they would like us not to do
this

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand i think it's um
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
it's important that they understand
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
and know that they can they can go
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:08.800 align:start position:0%

representative heath has an amendment
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh essentially move two million dollars
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
per year from the winter maintenance
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
accounting unit at the department of

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
to mechanical services for the purpose
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
of purchasing fleet equipment
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
um both of these uh
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
it should just be noted we just took an
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
action on winter maintenance
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
if this were to be approved too i just
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to be clear that they would both
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
be um
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
it'd be an incremental change it
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this this action wouldn't over
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
write what we just did so i would i
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
would add the uh the sum of both of
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
these actions when we when we form the
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
budget for you
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
as you'll notice on the winter
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance account presentation on the
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%

um greatly reduced and this would not
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
fix it but it would at least help out a
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
and we'd like to do that for d.o.t
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
i would i would like to say this oh
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
represent turcotte please go ahead
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
ways and means was able to find some
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
additional money and
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't say fine i mean the revenues
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
have been coming in uh
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
gangbusters and
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
position i would like to
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
see that money some of that money
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
used to support
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
the equipment requirements
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
and not take any additional out of
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance because
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
our forecast for
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
um road toll
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
and turnpike toll are
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
not that rosy for the next
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
two years i mean i realize we can go
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
that safety safety the transportation
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
can go
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
to um fiscal
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
but if there's no money there then it
 
00:53:15.119 --> 00:53:16.309 align:start position:0%
but if there's no money there then it
becomes

00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
a little difficult for fiscal
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
to approve uh
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance money so that's
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
my thought um and
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh i'll let let's see representative
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
turcotte i believe you
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm all set for now i don't think
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative heath so madam chair
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
based on what you just said you said
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
that there are additional funds
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
coming out of ways and means and you
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
would be willing
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
to take two million of that funding
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
to put into the line
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
of equi building
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
yeah equipment maintenance
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
and actually that would do
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
what we had proposed to do so am i
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry my question is are you
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
you said you the additional funding was
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
identified in ways and means
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
and you would be willing to take two
 
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:36.390 align:start position:0%
and you would be willing to take two
million

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
of that funding for each year of the
 
00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.870 align:start position:0%
of that funding for each year of the
biennium

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
yes what's the problem and i would
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
withdraw my amendment madam chair
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
and i would go with what you have
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
recommended thank you okay
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
no i think that was fine with me i was
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
just going to ask if we had already
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
moved the 2 million out of winter
 
00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:04.950 align:start position:0%
moved the 2 million out of winter
maintenance

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that have been the two million
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
that we put into mechanical services
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
but um i support if you're support what
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
you were doing if we can get the money
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
from ways and means then
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
let's do that thank you well i
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
i hope so i'll put it that way okay
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
that concludes house bill 1 amendments
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
we have if we jump back over to the
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
tracker we still have two two amendments
 
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
to consider that do not have a
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
money impact to them on the state budget
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
one is the representative weiler
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
amendment relative to the school
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
planning committee vacancies
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
and the other is relative to the charter
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
school lease
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
aid cap from five house bill 521.
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
we discussed both of these yesterday
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:06.549 align:start position:0%
 
amendments

00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%

yes thank you madam chair um on the
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
weiler amendment
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
i was under the impression that uh
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
might come on and actually explain what
 
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.829 align:start position:0%
might come on and actually explain what
his

00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh amendment meant because i
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
i don't think most of us under
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
understood it i know i didn't
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
i concur wholeheartedly
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
and i asked him to try to be with us
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
at 11. uh mickey is he out there yet
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
i don't see him here we can do
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
the other amendment uh what's the number
 
00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:48.069 align:start position:0%
the other amendment uh what's the number
here

00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh 0 894 and maybe he'll show up here in
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
the next couple minutes to discuss
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
his amendment uh could you give him a
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
call i think he's in his office
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
if we could um zero
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
eight nine four h okay
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
um this amendment
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost us any money it is
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
simply allowing
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
the charter schools
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
lease payments of 50 000 or
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
50 thousand dollars this does not neces
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
there's no more money associated with
 
00:57:44.319 --> 00:57:45.510 align:start position:0%
there's no more money associated with
this

00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's just that um when
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
the money when the requests come in
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
to doe then uh they will be
 
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
prorated like a lot of other things
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
within the um within the budget
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
or within education
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
so that's um that's why
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
we are um that's why i'm putting this
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
amendment in
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
just to allow i have no idea what
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
um what the lease costs are broken down
 
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.630 align:start position:0%
um what the lease costs are broken down
by

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
um particular charter schools all this
 
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.030 align:start position:0%
um particular charter schools all this
does

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
is if their lease cost is
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
between 30 and 50 000 that they can
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
apply for the the money to
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
um to fund it doesn't mean they're going
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
to get it
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
it just means that that is now the
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
upper limit so are there any
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
could i have a motion to approve

half an hour to get all this stuff done
 
01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:01.430 align:start position:0%
half an hour to get all this stuff done
so

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%

calendar
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%

second kovitz shot on monday afternoon
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
in because i had that in my calendar i'm
 
01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.069 align:start position:0%
in because i had that in my calendar i'm
wondering

01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't we're not voting on that
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't seem like i need to sub
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
or do am i going to need to sub for
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
whatever we do on monday
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're not having anything on monday okay
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
if i if i understood correctly
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
tuesday is the uh
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
excuse me is full finance to
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh discuss the budget at
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
is that right mickey
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
don't shake ahead i honestly don't know
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
i know
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh as of about 10 o'clock this morning i
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
know there was uh
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
they were still trying to work the
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
schedule because we do have a lot of
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
bills to exec
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
as well i think there's ten ten bills
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
the committee has to execute two before
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
our deadline in addition to house bill
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
one and two
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
so um i think most of except for one is
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
retained anyways but we still have to
 
01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:30.309 align:start position:0%
retained anyways but we still have to
formally

01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
formally
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
do that as a full committee so i think
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
janet was still scheduling
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
um next week last i heard so i haven't
 
01:04:36.799 --> 01:04:37.190 align:start position:0%
um next week last i heard so i haven't
seen

01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
any fixed dates or times okay do we need
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
to retain do we need a motion to retain
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
sb 82 how do we dispose of that no well
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't we haven't
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
officially started work on that in divi
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
in house finance yet that bill's been
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
referred to us but we still have to have
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
a public hearing on it before it even
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
comes to division
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
at some point since we adopted the
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
amendment with the language from
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
senate bill 82 into house bill 2 uh
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
you'd probably just want to retain that
 
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.109 align:start position:0%
you'd probably just want to retain that
bill

01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
when it does eventually make its way to
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
us but um i think we're still
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
a little early on senate bill 182
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
because we still have to have a public
 
01:05:11.839 --> 01:05:13.750 align:start position:0%
because we still have to have a public
hearing

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay so that that one you won't have to
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
worry about for crossover that'll be a
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
post crossover bill we deal with okay
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
i see that janet has janet clayman has
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
you could bring her up and she'll have
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
hi janet here i am
 
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
i was just listening to you talk about
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
monday and it's my understanding right
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
now i'm still waiting for confirmation
 
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
from representative weiler but
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
it looks like monday is going to be
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
um monday morning would be when you
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
could work
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
on your all those retain bills that you
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
still need to exec
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
out and you've got one that is uh
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 600 from division three which
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
that one
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
came out ought to pass as amended but
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
every all the other bills are retained
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and then it looks like the after late
 
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.789 align:start position:0%
um and then it looks like the after late
june

01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
june
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
just a minute just a minute 600
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%

01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%

okay
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
uh no no no don't worry you don't have
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
um but i'm told like so then that would
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
be monday morning and then monday
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon you'd go into
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
um talking about house bill 1 and house
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill 2. that would be the
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
like the briefing by the divisions to
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
the full
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
bull committee and then tuesday looks
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
like it would be a work day for
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
lba and ols to work on developing the
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
the combined budget amendments and then
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
um what i have is in wednesday the 31st
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
would be the continued exec
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
session on house bill 1 and house bill
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
2. so like i said i'm right now i'm
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
waiting for confirmation from
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
from representative weiler um i j and i
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
did just try to call him
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
about the amendment he has envisioned
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
two but
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
he didn't pick up his phone and his his
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
um his mailbox is full
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
so i couldn't leave him a message yes i
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
i tried that as well did you
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so as i was just
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
i was just sending him an email when i
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
heard you discussing not having to work
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
on monday but i think
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
it looks like that's because that
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion was sent to
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
um aaron and the speaker and he
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
he approved i think he thought that
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
scheduling was fine
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
so okay so that's a change from
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
yesterday yeah but i like i said i
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
haven't heard i just i kind of before i
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
put anything in the calendar i'd really
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
like to have representative weiler say
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
yes this is what we're doing you know i
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
don't wanna just presume that i'm
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
gonna just schedule people so
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
okay so so monday and wednesday
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes correct will there be mo
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
voting on monday do i need to worry
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
about a sub or will there be any
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
is monday a listening day or a voting
 
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:12.870 align:start position:0%
is monday a listening day or a voting
day

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
i think it's from what from my notes
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
that i have from
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh mr kane it looks like it's just
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's just briefing like it doesn't look
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
like there's any voting but i
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
i that i i don't know i mean i can't
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
i can't confirm that um
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh well actually hang on because it does
 
01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.829 align:start position:0%
uh well actually hang on because it does
say

01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
um the divisions will present the
 
01:08:39.199 --> 01:08:39.990 align:start position:0%
um the divisions will present the
recommendations

01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the full committee
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
lbas then directed to draft the official
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
amendments for
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
house bill one and two um for committee
 
01:08:47.199 --> 01:08:47.829 align:start position:0%
house bill one and two um for committee
vote

01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
so i guess that would mean that you
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
would be voting on certain things
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
and then giving it to the lba what do
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
you think
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
yeah usually sorry usually what we do is
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
each division will present their budget
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
package the house bill one changes in
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
the division two or house bill two
 
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.349 align:start position:0%
the division two or house bill two
amendments

01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
and the committee will vote to adopt
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
those amendments so we'll go around and
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
adopt house bill one
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
and two for division one same for
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
division two division three
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
then our office will go back and
 
01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
actually string everything together to
 
01:09:17.199 --> 01:09:17.749 align:start position:0%
actually string everything together to
be

01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
basically one house bill two on one host
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
for one and then that's the official
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
um wednesday in this case so there
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
probably would be
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
would that be finished in the morning
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
my my shot isn't until the afternoon so
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
um by the sounds of it janet
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
is that the plan for the afternoon is to
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
get into house bill one and two and
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
monday morning would be on the other
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
bills correct
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and i don't know how long
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
it'll take to do those 10 bills i mean
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
they were all retained except for one
 
01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.070 align:start position:0%
they were all retained except for one
but

01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
that's not my you know i don't know so
 
01:10:00.239 --> 01:10:01.189 align:start position:0%
that's not my you know i don't know so
um

01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
when i spoke with mr kane he said yeah
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
you'd have to start at nine o'clock on
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
monday morning and take care of all the
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
the bills that are in your possession
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
and then move on to house bill one and
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
house bill two
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't think there's anything
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
controversial in the bills that have
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
been retained
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
right so maybe you could move into house
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
bill one hospital two
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
at ten o'clock in the morning i mean i
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know if it only takes about an hour
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
to take care of those
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
retain bills the roll calls will be the
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
most time consuming
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
i guess kate representative murray the
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
answer to that is that
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
um you might want to um
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
have somebody or or you talk to mary
 
01:10:54.719 --> 01:10:55.669 align:start position:0%
have somebody or or you talk to mary
jane

01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
jane
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
and see what um see what her preference
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
is on that it's you know
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
in division you know i would have told
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
you yes go ahead and get a sum
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
but i don't i can't speak for
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
how when you don't know how long it's
 
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.310 align:start position:0%
how when you don't know how long it's
taken

01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
taken
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
i'm fine in the morning but my shots you
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
know two o'clock in the afternoon and
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
we do not give up our shots do we
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely not
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
all right we'll discuss that and we'll
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
certainly let you know whether or not i
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
need a sub
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you janet thank you so much uh
 
01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.189 align:start position:0%
uh thank you janet thank you so much uh
that

01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that's okay i guess uh we'll all
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
flip a coin
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh to the
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge um
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
those sessions are going to not
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
so if um i don't know
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
i'll try to get some clarification
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
before tomorrow
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
um i'll
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
i'll send another email out and
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
see if representative weiler reads his
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
email so
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative heath well thank you
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
ma'am cheer um
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
just i wanted to make sure that on those
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
sessions they
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
may not be virtual or are they going to
 
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:32.950 align:start position:0%
may not be virtual or are they going to
be

01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
um kind of a hybrid
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
i think okay and that's just me
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
that they will be hybrid but i'm not
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not positive i don't know that um
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
that decision has been made by
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative wyler
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
i just i don't know thank you man
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
yeah but if they if they are hybrid
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
they the finance committee will meet in
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
reps hall and
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
so that will be um you know fully spaced
 
01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:12.470 align:start position:0%
so that will be um you know fully spaced
out

01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
