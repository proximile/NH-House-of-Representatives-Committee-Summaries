hampshire national guard
 
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
so first i want to explain to you the uh
 
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
the why behind the what
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
so why why are we doing this and what is
 
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
um you know the purpose behind this
 
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire army national guard is
 
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
obviously a small state we're a small
 
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.550 align:start position:0%
obviously a small state we're a small
state

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
the 17 smallest states for force
 
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
structure the size of our guard the less
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
than 3 000 right so the new hampshire
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
army national guard is 1700 soldiers and
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
1100 airmen
 
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
those seventeen hundred soldiers when
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
you're divided by our state's population
 
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're one of the smallest army national
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
guards per capita in the country
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
there's two leverage you get to
 
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
influence one is accessions getting the
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
new kids in on the street and the other
 
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
one is retention
 
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
in this market
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
the accessions is horrendous for the
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
entire department of defense
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
if you look what's going on and so i
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
sent out some attachments i just see
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
some recent articles about
 
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
how the department of defense is
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
struggling to fill their formations the
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
active duty army cut their end strength
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
the number of people in their formations
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
by 12 000 because they know they can't
 
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
make their numbers this year the air
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
forces come on and says they can't make
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
their numbers and it's the same thing in
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
the army national guard
 
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
so we struggle to fill our formations
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's like almost like a modern day
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
militia it's up to us to fill our
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
formations with those 1700 soldiers and
 
00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.270 align:start position:0%
formations with those 1700 soldiers and
airmen

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
airmen
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
the market's just not there
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
so if you can't influence the sessions
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
you can try to retain your force the
 
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
retention piece this is a retention uh
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
measure and that's the purpose behind
 
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.749 align:start position:0%
measure and that's the purpose behind
this

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
so if we get a soldier to come in and he
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
enlists and he lists he typically has a
 
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
six year obligation at the end of six
 
00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 align:start position:0%
years we're losing about 20 of our force
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know they finished their college
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
about 25 of our force joints for the
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
college benefit
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
so the purpose behind this bill is if
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
you re-enlist after six years of service
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
you can transfer that tuition waiver
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
benefit to your spouse
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
and allows your spouse to then attend
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
classes at the community college system
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
community college system of new
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire supports it we work together
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
with them to develop this language
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's why it's a five-year
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
pilot program so we can see the benefits
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh or the impact it will have on the
 
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
but we are struggling to fill our
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
formations and if we can't fill them
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
with newest sessions off the street
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
these high school kids at age 18 we want
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
to try to retain our fours
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
in order to retain our force it's all
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
about the spouse that significant other
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
you in the next 12 months we'll deploy a
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
third of our force either overseas or
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
the southwest border
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
you know the strain or stressors that
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
places on a military family are huge and
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
like they're significant so if we can
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
retain the spouse to have an impact
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
on their significant other to stay in
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
the service it is money
 
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.830 align:start position:0%
the service it is money
subject well spent

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
subject well spent
 
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my question
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
um i was wondering
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
so in order for them to be
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
the members spouse to be eligible
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
they have to do a six-year tour of duty
 
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.029 align:start position:0%
they have to do a six-year tour of duty
correct

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
and then they have to do another four in
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
the reserves as well is that right
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
so that soldier or airmen will serve for
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
typically for their first initial
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
entry service contract in six years
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
if he or she re-enlists
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
beyond that six year like for another
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
four or six years in a national guard
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
only um then they he or she can transfer
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
to their spouse
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
yeah follow-up um
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
so after
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
they've served then the transfer becomes
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
effective correct yes
 
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.150 align:start position:0%
effective correct yes
um

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
the question the second question i had
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
is at the bottom it says section for
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
this act
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's confusing but
 
00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:28.309 align:start position:0%
it's confusing but
the

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
if the past the legislation you know
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
will take
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
effect immediately or after the governor
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
signs it
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
but it's only good till july of 27
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
because the community college system of
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire wanted to evaluate its
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
impact on their on their budget
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
so it's really it's it's good until july
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
of 27th
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
and then based upon that economic impact
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the community college system we'll
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
evaluate it and then hopefully renew it
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
for perpetuity
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay so it's after the passage of the
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
it has a five-year
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
out date yes thank you
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh any other questions
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes i'm representative lawton thanks
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
um so would this
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
basically if it gets past and the
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
governor signs it will it have an
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
immediate um benefit upon people that
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
have already
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh done six years or something like
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
could somebody use it like right away
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so for example if uh if you're a
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
service member you've been
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
hypothetically in for 10 years
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
you can then transfer to your spouse i
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify too it's in the
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
language that um it's one of the other
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
the service member of the spouse we're
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
not double dipping one person gets to
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
the other so if the service member says
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
you know i got my undergraduate degree
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'll now transfer to my spouse and it
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
has to be a spouse that's in the uh the
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
department of defense we call it dears
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
the the physical enrollment uh
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
enrollment system it just can't be
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily like a my significant other
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
it has to be a sort of registered spouse
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
within the department of defense uh
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
enrollment system
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh any other questions for the
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
general uh representative
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
my question is why not expand it to also
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
children of uh national guard members as
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
well instead of just spouses
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
excellent question and so
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
i'll give an example the first state to
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
do this was pennsylvania they did about
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
two or three years ago and they did
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
exactly that they did it for both their
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
spouses and their children
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
we specifically said no to the children
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
the reason why is
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
80 of new recruits come from a military
 
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.389 align:start position:0%
80 of new recruits come from a military
family

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
so we want to cut off our nose and spot
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
of our face
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
so that's a next like what's their
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
incentive for those
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
kids to join
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's why we purposely excluded
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh military children
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
okay are there any representative
 
00:10:55.839 --> 00:11:09.350 align:start position:0%
okay are there any representative
rollins

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
it's a reimbursement so it's just a
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
tuition waiver so no money ever sort of
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh transaction ever occurs between say
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
the university system of a community
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
college system and ourselves
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
a student a service member files a piece
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
of paper goes to that college
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
and they just waive the tuition you
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
still have to pay room and board and
 
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.630 align:start position:0%
still have to pay room and board and
fees

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
yeah general i'm not going to um i'm not
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
asking any questions or anything like
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
that because i'm a co-sponsor on this
 
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.110 align:start position:0%
that because i'm a co-sponsor on this
here's

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
here's
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
but anyways can you explain to him and
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to go back to skip for
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up on the space available that we
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
have now in law so they understand
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
what's there for national guard
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
yeah so initially um
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
it was previously written that it was on
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
a space available basis that if the
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
university system or community college
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
system had space availability um
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
they could um just attend that class for
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
that tuition waiver uh two years ago we
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
struck that from the law and the reason
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
why is um
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
the recruiting market is really
 
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.509 align:start position:0%
the recruiting market is really
cutthroat

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
cutthroat
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
and we were losing market share to
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
massachusetts because they didn't have
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of space availability waiver
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
so all we're trying to do is make either
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
maintain our competitive advantage over
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
our sister states or in advantage
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
this gives us an advantage over our
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
sister states that we um you know about
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh rep did you have another
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh sir can we had an airman get his law
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
degree through unh uh uh at manchester
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
unh uh
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh are there any other questions for the
 
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.230 align:start position:0%
uh are there any other questions for the
general

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you general for your
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you sir chair recognize
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
kevin grady with the state veterans
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen of the committee
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
good to see you again
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is kevin grady i
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
am a 25-year veteran of our air force
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
and i'm a
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
22-year resident of the town of hooksett
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
new hampshire today i'm here
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
representing the state veterans advisory
 
00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:23.590 align:start position:0%
representing the state veterans advisory
committee

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.389 align:start position:0%
committee
we

00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
debated this long and hard and talked
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
about it was one of the more lively
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
conversations we had and then we all
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
kind of realized that we need to get
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
behind a bill like this because we think
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's a win-win for new hampshire and the
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
re the way i'll explain that is if if in
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
fact we have somebody who has finished
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
their initial
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
tour of enlistment and the opportunities
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
are better somewhere else for their
 
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.189 align:start position:0%
are better somewhere else for their
spouse

00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
spouse
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
or for themselves that's probably where
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to go
 
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.189 align:start position:0%
they're going to go
so

00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
we we want to try and retain as many of
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
these people as we possibly can and if
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
it turns out that the
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
the spouse is really in a better
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
position perhaps to finish a degree
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
quicker and perhaps get a job in our
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
local economy faster that might allow us
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
to retain that that military person uh
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
the the way this program is set up every
 
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.550 align:start position:0%
the the way this program is set up every
year

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
the uh in november the uh adjutant
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
general is going to get a report from
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
the university system as to how many
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
people actually use this
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
benefit and so by doing this for the
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
three years the reason this thing sun
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
sets in in 2027 well five years i guess
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
now uh is that we're going to be able to
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
have a chance to look at this program
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
and see what the true cost is when this
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
was done in the in the senate the the
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
the university system was behind the
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
idea because the it's either the member
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
or the spouse that's eligible to use
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
this not both of them at the same time
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
so the the the a person attending a
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
class is a person sitting in a seat
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
attending a class whether that's the
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
member or the the spouse
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't really you know affect them all
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
of that much um the final thing that
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
i'll give you just try to bring this to
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
life a little bit in terms of the
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
retention part of all of this
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
for the general um
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
if i take somebody that and i'll let me
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
do what i know which is air force stuff
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
let's say we have an an airman who is a
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh is a boom operator on our kc 46 is
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
over at peas
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
if that person decides after their
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
initial six-year commitment to go ahead
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
and leave the military or maybe that
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
person decides that the benefits are
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
better in another state and they're
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
going to ziggy over there and take that
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
same benefit in another
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
state then we lose that person's
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
expertise and all the time and effort
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
and training that we throw into that
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
person now i general nicolitis can
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
assess another boom operator and we can
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
train that person and on paper
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
when we we're finished with that
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
transaction we got the same number of
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
boom operators that we had the other day
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
but as i like to say we traded away big
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
poppy for marv throneberry okay we
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
traded away somebody that that has a lot
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
of experience and and can pass that
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
experience on to our younger folks for
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
somebody who is going to have to be the
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of somebody else
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
transferring their experience to them so
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
we wholeheartedly support this bill and
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions really that's
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
all i want to tell you this morning okay
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you kevin are there any uh
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
questions but kevin
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
c and none uh thank you kevin i'd like
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
to bring up general michaelitis back up
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
general can you explain to the committee
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
the difference between the so they
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
understand the yellow ribbon new gi bill
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
versus this program here and i'm not
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
asking a question so nobody gets
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
confused because i am a sponsor i
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
already know the answer but explain them
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
the difference is there a conflict is
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
there not
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
whereas if the gi bill you
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
you're getting paid money to go to
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
school and it can be shared with your uh
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
kids versus this here
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
so sir just correct me if i i think i
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
know where you're going um so say the
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
montgomery gi bill so what happens if
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
you go on active duty and you serve two
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
three four years ten years whatever you
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
if the federal government picks up the
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
tap for you to go to college in very
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
general terms
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
this is complementary
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
right so um
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
that is a federal uh
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
not entire uh it's a federal program
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
that only our soldiers who have either a
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
they had served on active duty initially
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
or b they were activated or deployed
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
they accrue that federal service time
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
and then can use that gi bill
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
this is more for the traditional sort of
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
so three two thirds or three quarters of
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
our force just
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
are part time
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
so of the 2 800 soldiers and airmen we
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
have in the new hampshire national guard
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
both army and air about 70 of them are
 
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.630 align:start position:0%
both army and air about 70 of them are
part-time

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
traditional soldiers and airmen who go
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
through the basic training come to us
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
serve their week in a month this is true
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
really for them i mean everyone can use
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
this but it's almost a complimentary
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
educational benefit versus a replacement
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
and then generally speaking you have to
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
use your montgomery gi bill first if you
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
have both before you use this
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay did everyone understand on that
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
system there because this really will
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
benefit the young soldiers coming in for
 
00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:22.470 align:start position:0%
benefit the young soldiers coming in for
retention

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
retention
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
you know i mean to maintain and be able
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
to re-enlist and stuff but
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
i don't see it being used a lot because
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
of the ones all the veterans that served
 
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.390 align:start position:0%
of the ones all the veterans that served
overseas

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
um their dependents could use that money
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
and the college systems are going to get
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
paid you know to the federal government
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
so think of it like this you know the
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
the data says most service members get
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
out at nine years
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
and what do they get out of nine years
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
so just let's just do some simple math
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
in a way say you join at 20 you're now
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
29 30 years old what happens when you're
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
30. you're most likely if you're
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
part-time with us you're establishing
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
your civilian job
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
and you're probably starting a family
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
and guess what those week in a month is
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
like sort of a drain on you you're like
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
you know what comes first my civilian
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
job or my part-time job what comes first
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
my family or going to my week in a month
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
so this is huge to retention so when we
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
talk about military families and what we
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
sort of do for the support of them you
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
know this is the enticement to say hey
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
your spouse can say
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
like hey dummy i i can go to school now.
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
and uh the secretary of the army came to
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire about a year or two ago
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
and met the governor and one of his
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
lines or topics was the governor was sir
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
don't you understand the military is the
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
escalator to the middle class we're all
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
about education blue collar white collar
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're all about educational
 
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.750 align:start position:0%
we're all about educational
opportunities

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
for building a better workforce and a
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
better citizen
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's the why thank you okay thank you
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
everyone understand uh
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
i brought that up so you understand the
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
breakdown of this here from coming from
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%

two other reps that are coming back in
uh

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative loomis and mark pearson

so it shouldn't go it shouldn't be long
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know i may be real quick exactly
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:53.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

famous chair i simply like to say that
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
that this uh seems to be a
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
a very positive
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
recruiting retention
 
01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.789 align:start position:0%
recruiting retention
measure

01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
measure
 
01:03:42.799 --> 01:03:43.910 align:start position:0%
measure
that

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
the senate has sent to us
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
general mikulitis explained
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
in detail
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
how this would help
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
spouses male or female
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
to go back
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
and use this tuition waiver benefit to
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
take classes
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
so uh yes the recruitment retention
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
education uh all good in my view
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
awesome and anyone else want to speak on
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
i just had a question mr chairman right
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
here um about lack of a fiscal note is
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
it because the federal government's
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
going to cover the entire program
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
including administration well there
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
actually there's no money uh this is um
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
the these are seats that the colleges
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
are giving up
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
so there's no money coming from the
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
state okay so the state doesn't cover
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
any administration no because and
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
they're already because they're already
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
getting money from the budget okay so
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
that that's why there's no fiscal note
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
on this here
 
01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.349 align:start position:0%
on this here
um

01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
if um in the hearing era i mean i asked
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
the general there to explain to when
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
they're on the education on the
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
different programs that are out there
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
most in today's society where veterans
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
like he said most veterans uh and just
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
like in that society don't get married
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
for 10 years you know i mean until the
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
age 30 and matter of fact they're having
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
one or two kids if they're lucky
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh but the first six years many veterans
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
are single
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of veterans on active duty do
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
show up with young girls that are
 
01:05:09.599 --> 01:05:10.870 align:start position:0%
show up with young girls that are
pregnant

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know i mean in my time that i've
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
seen over and over that's why i spoke
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
out on the marriage thing you know i'm
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
protecting them young girls so they can
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
get the benefits to have kids and
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
everything but this hair bill is a
 
01:05:21.599 --> 01:05:22.950 align:start position:0%
everything but this hair bill is a
win-win

01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
win-win
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
for more and more spouses whether it be
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
male or female of a veteran to get
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
educated and it just makes new hampshire
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
that much better and it retains
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
the uh national guard and national guard
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh to stay longer than just a six-year
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
program so they have to do another four
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
years so it's a win-win for us here so
 
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.750 align:start position:0%
years so it's a win-win for us here so
yes

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
question um thank you mr chairman i was
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
just wondering what was the um what was
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
the rationale uh from the sponsors of
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
just limiting this to spouses and not
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
expanding it to children was it just to
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
see how the cost because if you give it
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
to the children there then why would
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
they want to join the military and get
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know and go to school for nothing
 
01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:04.470 align:start position:0%
you know and go to school for nothing
fair

01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
fair
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh that's the reason why the gi bill now
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
on the uh the uh
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
the yellow ribbon program that they
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
passed there
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
that they could be transferred to
 
01:06:13.359 --> 01:06:14.309 align:start position:0%
that they could be transferred to
children

01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
if this if the veteran does not use it
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
so that one but you have to be deployed
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
to a war or uh you know
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
into another um either a base or
 
01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799 align:start position:0%
something for so many months or whatever
 
01:06:26.799 --> 01:06:27.670 align:start position:0%
something for so many months or whatever
so

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
