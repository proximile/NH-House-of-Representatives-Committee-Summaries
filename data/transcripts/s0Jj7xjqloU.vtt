bill 1597.
 
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
what this bill simply does is to require
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
the defendants charged with felony
 
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.390 align:start position:0%
the defendants charged with felony
offenses

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
be arraigned in the circuit court
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
and that they be entitled to a probable
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
cause hearing
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
also known as a preliminary examination
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
this is a subject which may be familiar
 
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.749 align:start position:0%
this is a subject which may be familiar
to

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
many of you those who have served
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
multiple terms here in the legislature
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
up until 2016
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
felony arraignments people who were
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
arrested for felonies
 
00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:44.629 align:start position:0%
arrested for felonies
were

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
arraigned in the circuit court
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
and had their probable causes in the
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
in 2015
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature passed senate bill 124.
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
this bill was dubbed felonies first
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
and it provided that the superior court
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
would have sold jurisdiction over felony
 
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.909 align:start position:0%
would have sold jurisdiction over felony
cases

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
the bill provided that all felony
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
arraignments were to be held in the
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
and instead of defendants being
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
automatically uh scheduled and this uh
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
they no longer were entitled to a
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
probable cause hearing
 
00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:28.469 align:start position:0%
probable cause hearing
the

00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
burden of proof was shifted to the
 
00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:31.589 align:start position:0%
burden of proof was shifted to the
defendant

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
defendant
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
the defendant had to ask for the hearing
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
and there
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
and the defendant had to show there was
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
some defect in the charging in order to
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
be entitled to one
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
and ultimately the court the superior
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
court had the discretion to grant or
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
deny the request for a probable cause
 
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.350 align:start position:0%
deny the request for a probable cause
hearing

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill uh house senate bill 124
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
was very well intended the purpose was
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
to vertically integrate felony
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
arraignments into the superior court
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
which seemed to make a lot of sense and
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
it would seem to improve court
 
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.470 align:start position:0%
it would seem to improve court
efficiency

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
it was expected and this is a quote from
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
eliminate unnecessary delay and create
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
better outcomes for victims and
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
defendants and to quote
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
and i certainly believe that the theory
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
was reasonable
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
and it was done with the best of
 
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.190 align:start position:0%
and it was done with the best of
intentions

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
intentions
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
but despite all the good intentions
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
it does not appear that the program has
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
been as successful as intended
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
and house bill 1597
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
at least at this time would put felony
 
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
at least at this time would put felony
arraignments

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
arraignments
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
back into the circuit court and provide
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
defendants with the right to a probable
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
cause hearing
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
when the change happened i was a circuit
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
court judge and my life was very
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
different then than it is now
 
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.389 align:start position:0%
different then than it is now
when

00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
felonies moved out of the circuit court
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
my life became a lot easier as a circuit
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
court judge
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
no more arraignments for felonies and
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
their related charges
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
and no more probable cause hearings
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
but my perspective on the issue has
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
changed in the last few years
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
the time for resolution on felony cases
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
has improved
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
there are probably lots of reasons for
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
that but to the extent it was believed
 
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.829 align:start position:0%
that but to the extent it was believed
that

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
taking the felony arraignments and
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
putting them in the superior court
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
reduced the time of resolution for
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
felony cases has not proven to be the
 
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.509 align:start position:0%
felony cases has not proven to be the
case

00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
the driving uh the driving concept
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
between felony first was what was called
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
early case resolution
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
which makes a lot of sense dealing with
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
the case and trying to resolve it
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
earlier in the process
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
the real change caused by felony first
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
was the shift
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
from local police to the county
 
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.710 align:start position:0%
from local police to the county
attorneys

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
for charging decisions and for plea
 
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.870 align:start position:0%
for charging decisions and for plea
negotiations

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
this has been costly for the counties
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
who have all bulked up their uh had to i
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say bulked up but
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
all had to add additional staff in order
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
to accommodate felonies first
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
early case resolution has been somewhat
 
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.389 align:start position:0%
early case resolution has been somewhat
successful

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
but has not fulfilled its promise
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
in i know that at the time at least by
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
the testimony that i read back
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
that early case resolution was already
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
happening in one county
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
in stratford county
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
prior to this and was successful in
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
stratford county
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
it it that success not hasn't
 
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.750 align:start position:0%
it it that success not hasn't
necessarily

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
been transferred to all counties in this
 
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.590 align:start position:0%
been transferred to all counties in this
case

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
in seeking uh
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
and seeking a reason why felony first
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
hasn't been
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh as successful or early case
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
resolution hasn't been successful
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
what i found in in doing my research for
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
this build is there's a lot of finger
 
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.790 align:start position:0%
this build is there's a lot of finger
pointing

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
pointing
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of finger pointing
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
which in some cases points to county
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys in some cases points to public
 
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.790 align:start position:0%
attorneys in some cases points to public
defenders

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
defenders
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
in some cases points to the court
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
but again just lots
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
of finger pointing
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
in talking to one county attorney
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
it was said that we can't go back to
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
having police departments do
 
00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:36.550 align:start position:0%
having police departments do
arraignments

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
early involvement of the county attorney
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
is critically important
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
and i absolutely agree with that
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
but now that
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
there has been additional staff added in
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
each of the counties
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why the county can't
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
be more involved in early case
 
00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:55.910 align:start position:0%
be more involved in early case
resolution

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
even if the arraignments are done in the
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
it isn't as if
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
we have to turn the clock back
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
and make that type of change we can
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
improve the system
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
and you can and in fact that was what
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
was happening down in stratford county
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
they were doing early case resolution
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
even when the arraignments were done in
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
the circuit court
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
there's no reason
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
again why county attorneys cannot be
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
involved in charging decisions if
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
arraignments are held in the circuit
 
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.190 align:start position:0%
arraignments are held in the circuit
court

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
there's been an extra burden placed on
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
the public defender system which is
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
already overburdened and understaffed
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
the judicial council is currently
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
finding it difficult to obtain
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
representation for felony defendants
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
without probable cause hearings case
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
there's uh
 
00:13:55.199 --> 00:13:57.110 align:start position:0%
there's uh
a

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.189 align:start position:0%
a
sub

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
i think a point that i'd like to make is
 
00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
that there's a substantial difference
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
between probable cause hearings and
 
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
early case resolution
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
you would think that they would be
 
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.310 align:start position:0%
you would think that they would be
similar

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
but in the legislature we know that
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
things get done here in the legislature
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
when you have deadlines
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
the the difference between a probable
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
cause hearing and early case resolution
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
is that one has a consequence and the
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
other doesn't
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
when you have a probable cause hearing
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
a defendant has to make a choice
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
are they going to enter into some type
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
of resolution or are they going to be
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
bound over there's a consequence to that
 
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.069 align:start position:0%
bound over there's a consequence to that
decision

00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
if you really have early case resolution
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
basically you have a conference
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
i was talking to a public a public
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
defender who said
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
this is affecting uh my relationship
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
with my clients
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
and he said particularly the push
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
because the county attorneys are pushing
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
me pushing me pushing me to
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
end to have my client plea to have my
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
client plead to have my client plea
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
i can't develop a relationship with my
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
client if the only thing i'm asking my
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
client to do is enter a plea i have to
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
have some type of relationship and what
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
happens with the probable cause hearing
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
is there's a reason that we have to act
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
the defendant has to act and it's not
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
because i'm demanding that he enter a
 
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.110 align:start position:0%
because i'm demanding that he enter a
plea

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
prior to i'm told that prior to
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
uh prior to
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
uh when when probable cause hearings
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
were still heard in the
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
11 of the cases were resolved at or
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
before the probable cause hearing
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
with pleas
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
that never ended up going to the
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
superior court or being bound over to
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
the superior court
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
which is a substantial portion of the
 
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.590 align:start position:0%
which is a substantial portion of the
burden

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
because of felonies first the superior
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
court is handling many cases that it
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
would not have handled in the past
 
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.030 align:start position:0%
would not have handled in the past
and

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
because when you have a felony felonies
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
usually are accompanied by misdemeanors
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
and violation level offenses
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
and now those offenses which were
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
previously disposed of in the circuit
 
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.870 align:start position:0%
previously disposed of in the circuit
court

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
are now being handled by superior court
 
00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:28.310 align:start position:0%
are now being handled by superior court
judges

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
which is adding to the volume of the
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
work that they're doing in the superior
 
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.350 align:start position:0%
work that they're doing in the superior
court

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
and again creating that additional
 
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.389 align:start position:0%
and again creating that additional
burden

00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
burden
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
some of the blame i think you probably
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
hear some of the blame can be accorded
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
to covid
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
and certainly in terms of court
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
scheduling i think that that is the case
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
but it was interesting
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
i went back and i read the report the
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
the judicial council was required to
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
back

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
when only three counties had adopted
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
felonies first to see how it was working
 
00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:05.829 align:start position:0%
felonies first to see how it was working
out

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
and if you go back and read that report
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
as i did last night you'll see that
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
these same types of issues
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
were addressed in that report with the
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
hope that they would work out the bugs
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that they have
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
entirely worked out the bugs and i don't
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
believe that the problem is just
 
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.630 align:start position:0%
believe that the problem is just
covered

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
we have a long history in the state of
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
assuring people's rights by holding
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
probable cause hearings
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
i'm told that there's no constitutional
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
requirement for a probable cause hearing
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure that's the case
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
but if a person is threatened by the
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
state with at least a year in jail
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that it's fair to require
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
the state to show that there's a
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable basis for bringing the charge
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
i understand court efficiency
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it should be at the
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
expense of fairness
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
even if we do not reinstate an automatic
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
probable cause hearing
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
one should be made made available to all
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
defendants upon demand and they should
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
not have to prove that there's some
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
defect in the charging before they're
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
entitled to have one
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
finally when i was in the legislature
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
many years ago we were approached with
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
what seemed like a reasonable plan
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
it was to take some jury trials which
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
were ordinarily held in the superior
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
the legislation passed and the court
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
system implemented it
 
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
it converted court rooms around the
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
state to include jury boxes
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
and there were jury trials held in the
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
but frankly it just didn't work out
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
circuit court wasn't the place to hold
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
jury trials
 
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.669 align:start position:0%
jury trials
and

00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
and what we did was we rescinded that we
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
indicated that it just didn't work out
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
it was a mistake
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
and we fixed it
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes what seems like a good idea
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
just doesn't work out
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
and we ought to be able to acknowledge
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
finally again as a personal observation
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's a difference in the cultures
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
between the superior court and the
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
the circuit court handles high case
 
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.190 align:start position:0%
the circuit court handles high case
volumes

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
volumes
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
the circuit court has a has a hectic
 
00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:27.190 align:start position:0%
the circuit court has a has a hectic
pace

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
pace
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
and it has a get it done culture
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
the superior court has a very different
 
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.909 align:start position:0%
the superior court has a very different
culture

00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
culture
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
and a much different pace
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's far more methodical
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
the circuit court is a community court
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
one of the advantages of being able to
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
have arraignments in the circuit court
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
is that you can triage cases
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
we've tried to develop specialized
 
00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
we've tried to develop specialized
courts

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
for veterans
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
for mental health issues for substance
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
abuse issues
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
the circuit court judges are familiar
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
with the people in their community
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
they're able to do that triage
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
instead of somebody just showing up in
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
the superior court for a felony
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
a circuit court judge can make a
 
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.390 align:start position:0%
a circuit court judge can make a
determination

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
of what is best for that and what the
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
history of a particular defendant might
 
00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:29.190 align:start position:0%
history of a particular defendant might
be

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
holding arraignments and and
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court i believe is more
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
consistent with the character and
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony
 
00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:49.750 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony
and

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your
 
00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:52.549 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your
consideration

00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%

uh chairman gordon has copies of his
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
testimony available for the committee
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
i don't have copies for everyone on the
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
committee but i do can provide you with

thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question simpson yes i
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't see her oh that's okay yeah
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
behind a bunch of tears yeah yeah
 
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.470 align:start position:0%
behind a bunch of tears yeah yeah
um

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
i missed one of the points that you were
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
making i was um
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
writing and you cited the percentage of
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
courts i mean percentage of cases that
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
did not ever go over to the superior
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
court and i just missed what that
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
percentage was
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh i'm told it's 11 percent okay thank
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
you i think other people may testify and
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
say it was a higher number okay but the
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
number that i
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
that i feel confident in is eleven
 
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.390 align:start position:0%
that i feel confident in is eleven
percent

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah a question from uh our clerk
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair thank
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
i recall you referencing 70 percent
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
not now and somehow i'm confused as to
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
what the seventy percent and the eleven
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
i don't wrote seventy percent
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know where the 70 came from
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
representative horgan you had a question
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
chair and um thank you very much mr
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative gordon um
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm embarrassed to say that i don't
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
know this even though i was around as a
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
member of this committee back when we
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
were debating felonies first it's quite
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
a lively debate but um does this bill
 
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
just put the law back the way it was
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
pre-2017 or are there some changes from
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
how it was
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
back then
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
good question and
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
it effectively puts
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
it back the way it was prior to
 
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.789 align:start position:0%
it back the way it was prior to
the

00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
the the purpose and
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
and frankly there may be some middle
 
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.230 align:start position:0%
and frankly there may be some middle
ground

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
ground
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
here and it
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
to uh work things out but frankly the
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
system isn't working right now
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be fixed
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
and this bill puts things back the way
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
they were
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
but if there's some other way of fixing
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
it that makes sense i certainly would
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
entertain that
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair what a great
 
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:10.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair what a great
committee

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
next the chair will recognize randy
 
00:24:11.919 --> 00:24:17.190 align:start position:0%
next the chair will recognize randy
hawks

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
oh yeah microphone please
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
test there we go great
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
i'm randy hawks i'm the executive
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire public
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
defender program i'm here today in an
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
informational capacity
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
to provide a perspective that might be
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
of value to this committee
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
when sb 124 the bill that created
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
felonies first was being prepared
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
i was part of a group of prosecutors
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys judges and clerks
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
assembled to weigh in on that project
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
i believe then as i do now that the
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
public defender program which handles 90
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
percent of cases in the indigent defense
 
00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:09.750 align:start position:0%
percent of cases in the indigent defense
system

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
had an obligation to consider any
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
innovation that could potentially
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
improve the criminal justice process
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
everyone on the felonies first working
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
group agreed that the objective was to
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
make a system that would make felony
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
case processing more efficient
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
while incorporating fundamental tenants
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
that would assure the due process rights
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
of defendants
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
the objective of that bill was reduced
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
to a shorthand
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
same justice sooner
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
during the process leading up to sb 124
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
being filed i suggest i suggested that
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
the bill include a sunset clause in the
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
event that it couldn't deliver on those
 
00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:48.950 align:start position:0%
event that it couldn't deliver on those
promises

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
promises
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
the idea was rejected by proponents as
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
being too pessimistic
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
nonetheless when the bill was pending i
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
wrote an opinion piece in the new
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire bar news in support of the
 
00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:00.470 align:start position:0%
hampshire bar news in support of the
proposal

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
in that editorial i wrote that felonies
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
burst was a worthwhile experiment
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
however i also warned
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
we must be vigilant to ensure that it
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
delivers on its promises
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
i would note that the then chair of this
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
committee robert rowe
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
also wrote a letter to the bar news
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
endorsing the bill
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
like me chairman rowe closed his letter
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
with a caveat
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
if felonies first does not meet
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
expectations the law will be amended or
 
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.750 align:start position:0%
expectations the law will be amended or
eliminated

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a long history of
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
creative problem solving
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
we also have an equally long history of
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
being unafraid to change direction if
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
the initial change doesn't produce the
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
anticipated effect
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
as someone who supported felonies first
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
at its inception i will present an
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
appraisal based on data
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
rather than upon anecdotes that could
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
in reviewing data from new hampshire
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
public defenders case management system
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
one obvious shortcoming of felonies
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
first has been the inability to
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
replicate in superior court the
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency with which less serious
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
felonies were resolved in the district
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
court under the previous system
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
it's axiomatic that
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
low-grade felonies shouldn't take as
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
long to resolve as serious felonies
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
historically those cases were often
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
resolved swiftly in the local level
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's an advantage to having the
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to negotiate the disposition
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
of such cases at the local level where
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
local police prosecutors in the district
 
00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:38.389 align:start position:0%
local police prosecutors in the district
courts

00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
are familiar with the facts of a case
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
and they're often familiar with the
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
defendants involved
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
so they were able to make decisions
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
about the fair uh the fair resolution of
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
these cases in a relatively expeditious
 
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.230 align:start position:0%
these cases in a relatively expeditious
manner

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
that element of local control was a
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
major factor in quickly resolving a
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
substantial percentage of these
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
low-grade felonies
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
that efficiency was lost when felonies
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
first was implemented
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
i looked at data on all felonies
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
resolved in all courts statewide from
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
the year prior to the implementation of
 
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
felonies first which is 2015 through
 
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
2019 between 2015 and 2019 various
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
district courts were sequentially
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
removed from the process as felonies
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
first was implemented in successive
 
00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
first was implemented in successive
counties

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
eventually all felonies were filed in
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
the superior court
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
between 2015 and 2019 the time required
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
to resolve the average felony increased
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
in 2015 the combined
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
district court and superior court
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
resolution of felonies averaged 20.3
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
weeks from open to close
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
i might note that there is no need to
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
take notes during my testimony because
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
i've provided the committee with 30
 
00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.470 align:start position:0%
i've provided the committee with 30
copies

00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
copies
 
00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.269 align:start position:0%
copies
of

00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
of my statement and additional
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
supplemental uh statistical information
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
so that's all going to be available to
 
00:29:05.919 --> 00:29:06.870 align:start position:0%
so that's all going to be available to
you

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
in 2016
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
felonies first implementation began with
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
stratfor county and cheshire county and
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
they were joined halfway through the
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
year in july by belknap county so the
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
total in 2016 increased to 21.2 weeks to
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
resolve the average felony
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
a year later in 2017 other counties
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
started implementing felonies first on a
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
rolling rolling basis and as they did
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
too there was decreased district court
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
involvement by 2017 the time for the
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
average felony resolution had increased
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
to 24.3 weeks
 
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.190 align:start position:0%
to 24.3 weeks
2018

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
2018
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
all felonies were filed in state in
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
superior court statewide however there
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
were a few stragglers of felonies that
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
had been filed previously that was sort
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
of for lack of a better term
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in into the district court
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
and a few of those were making their way
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
through the pipeline nonetheless in 2018
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
the time to resolve the average felony
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
had increased to 26.9 weeks
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
and by 2019 all felonies were out of the
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
district courts completely and were in
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
superior court exclusively and the time
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
then was up to 27.9 weeks to resolve the
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
average felony so we've gone from the
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
year before felonies first at 20.3 weeks
 
00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:21.470 align:start position:0%
year before felonies first at 20.3 weeks
to

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
i have the data and it's included in
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
your statistical information
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
for 2020 and 2021 but because the
 
00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:34.549 align:start position:0%
for 2020 and 2021 but because the
pandemic

00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
slowed court operations
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
the data is skewed i think beyond
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
relevance for this discussion so i ended
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
the analysis in 2019.
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
to gauge the loss of efficiency of
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
district court resolutions i looked at
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
felonies resolved in district courts of
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
all counties pre-felonies first and
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
compared that time with felonies
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
resolved in the superior court of that
 
00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.630 align:start position:0%
resolved in the superior court of that
county

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
as i say i've provided the full detail
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
of all the district courts and all the
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
superior courts but i don't want to
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
belabor the time here by reciting it all
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
but i'll give you just a couple of
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
salient examples
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
the weeks from open to close for an
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
average felony i looked at rockingham
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
county in 2015.
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
the district courts are brentwood candia
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
derry hampton plaistow portsmouth and
 
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.870 align:start position:0%
derry hampton plaistow portsmouth and
salem

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
salem
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
all those district courts combined
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
closed 37 percent of the total number of
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
felonies in rockingham county and they
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
did so in 10 weeks
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
the remaining ones that were resolved in
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
the superior court averaged 31 weeks
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
from open to close so as i say 37 of
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
felonies resolved in district court in
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
an average of 21 weeks quicker than
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
those that went to superior court
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
one more example merrimack county the
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
district courts i looked at were concord
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
franklin hillsborough i didn't include
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
the statistics from hooksett because our
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
office in concord and our office in
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
manchester both shared that court at
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
different times and the statistics were
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
a little skewed and there weren't enough
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
numbers to move the needle
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
at any rate for merrimack county all the
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
district courts
 
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.110 align:start position:0%
district courts
of

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.310 align:start position:0%
of
uh

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
852 felonies resolved by our concord
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
office in merrimack county in 2015
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
319 were resolved in district court in
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
an average of 13 weeks
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
533 were resolved in merrimack county
 
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
superior court in an average of 31 weeks
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
so there's a
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
37 percent that were resolved in the
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
district courts were done 18 weeks
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
quicker than those that were resolved in
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
the superior court so as you can see
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
just from those two examples felonies
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
were resolved more efficiently in the
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
district courts
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh as i say the
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
average time statewide and you can see
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
all the statistics in the
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
written portion uh in the district court
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
was 10.6 weeks and the average time to
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
resolve a felony in superior court was
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
so i will skip over all the
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
district court details that you can
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
review at your leisure
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
i also analyze closed case data from
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
offices around the state to determine
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
whether felonies first had delivered the
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote same justice as it had
 
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.950 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote same justice as it had
promised

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
promised
 
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
the objective of felonies first was that
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
the outcomes would generally be the same
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
the only difference being that they
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
would happen in superior court instead
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
of district court
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
in analyzing the data i looked at the
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
number of felony cases opened in each
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
office the year before felonies first
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
was implemented i eliminated from the
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
statistics any cases where new hampshire
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
public defender withdrew because of a
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest or because the
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
defendant had hired private counsel i
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
also removed all cases that were closed
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
because the client failed to appear or
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
was declared incompetent or was deceased
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
i eliminated those cases from
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
consideration in this analysis because
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
those would have happened irrespective
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
of whether felonies first was in place
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
or not they were closed
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason that i just listed
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
what i utilized i compiled the data only
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
on cases that were opened and resolved
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
by new hampshire public defender what i
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
found was the following
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
in the year prior to felonies first 62
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
percent of all felonies statewide were
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
resolved by a negotiated plea in which a
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
defendant pled to a misdemeanor or by a
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
disposition that was
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
involved some lesser resolution
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
now lesser resolutions a wide variety
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
they could include diversion having a
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
matter placed on file without a finding
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
placed on file with a finding case could
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
be null processed a case could be
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
continued to be dismissed a case could
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
actually be dismissed so again
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
prior to the implementation of felonies
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
for us 62 of all felonies statewide will
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
resolve with a misdemeanor or some
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
lesser resolution
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
by 2019 the percentage of felonies that
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
were resolved that way had decreased to
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
so we've been unable to attain
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
the stated goal of same justice and
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
we've been unable to attain
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
the stated goal of justice sooner
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
now as someone who supported felonies
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
first at its inception i'm disappointed
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
that it was unable to deliver on those
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
promises those of us who were proponents
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
at the inception had good intentions
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
and we supported the plan believing that
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
it had the potential to benefit all
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
criminal justice stakeholders
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
but new hampshire we recognize that
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes the best laid plans don't work
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
out the way we'd hoped
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
so i thank the members of this committee
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
for your willingness to assess where we
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
are and your deliberate consideration of
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
where we go from here
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and any questions for the
 
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.990 align:start position:0%
thank you and any questions for the
witness

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
witness
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
over to our left yes representative
 
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.150 align:start position:0%
over to our left yes representative
chase

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
chase
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question i am not a lawyer
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
i've gone to court maybe once or twice
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
in my life so
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
tell me with all of this what is the
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
circuit court doing now if they've had
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
all these
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
felony cases removed and is it going to
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
be a giant issue time wise and
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
scheduling if we were to revert back
 
00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:09.030 align:start position:0%
scheduling if we were to revert back
uh

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
that would be a question i think better
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
addressed to someone representing the
 
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
circuit court but i will say this our
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
circuit courts our local courts are
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
extremely busy they don't handle just
 
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
criminal matters they handle family
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
matters they handle uh landlord tenant
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
every kind of thing
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
if there were any branch of the system
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
that probably deserves more support i
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
would say it would be the local courts
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
they're the people's courts as
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative gordon said that's where
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of business takes place and it
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
takes place very efficiently
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
would this create a huge burden no
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
because statistics have shown in the
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
past that
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
probable cause hearings while scheduled
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
i think over 90 of them are waived
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
because the prosecutor gets together
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
with a defense attorney and they often
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
would work out an agreement you know
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
things were negotiated because people
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
had the facts at hand and as i said
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
before they often knew these defendants
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
because they were working in the local
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
police department
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
maybe a court would be well served to
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
have an additional clerk to deal with
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
the felony first matters coming through
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
for scheduling purposes but as i say to
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
appear in front of a judge
 
00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:22.470 align:start position:0%
appear in front of a judge
was

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
as rare as hen's teeth you know many
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
many probable cause
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
hearings were scheduled but very few
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
actually took place because people began
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
to talk it was an impetus for a
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
discussion early on probable cause
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
hearings actually served as the most
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
effective early case resolution in my
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
view that the state has ever known
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
because what it does it gives a date
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
when the rubber meets the road we're
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
either going to have a hearing or we're
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
going to talk about it and negotiate it
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
often they'll say you know defense
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys are realistic people if the
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
facts were overwhelming if it wasn't a
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
case that should be negotiated in the
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
district court it was a very serious
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
matter and
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
the facts of the gerstein affidavit or
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
whatever speak for themselves that would
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
often be waived
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
but there are a substantial percentage
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
of those cases that
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
again for lack of a better term i refer
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
to as a low-grade or less serious or
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps a victimless crime where the two
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
parties can get together early on and
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
say this would be a proper disposition
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
of this matter that would satisfy all
 
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.310 align:start position:0%
of this matter that would satisfy all
stakeholders

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.790 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
so

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia had a question
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you attorney
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
hawks for taking my question
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
significant bill
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
and a lot of details
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
and i think we've asked
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
our chairman about the
 
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.270 align:start position:0%
our chairman about the
the

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
um does this
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
exactly roll us back to where we were
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
before felonies first are there any
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
details that
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
you've seen in the bill that we should
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
be aware of
 
00:38:57.359 --> 00:39:03.910 align:start position:0%
be aware of
uh

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
i think the bill
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know there's always a question of
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
how it might be refined going forward
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
but the impetus of it is to revert back
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
simply scheduling these matters in the
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
district court and giving an opportunity
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
up the uh dispositions that i've
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
discussed to take place
 
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.630 align:start position:0%
discussed to take place
uh

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
might it be fine-tuned i'd leave that
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
i think those things are best left to
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
when we implemented this uh there was we
 
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.589 align:start position:0%
when we implemented this uh there was we
were

00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
it was suggested
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
that there would be a savings in the uh
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
county corrections department for
 
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.349 align:start position:0%
county corrections department for
uh

00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
felons would be held less
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
a less lesser period of time and there
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
would be a savings there
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
of course there was um
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
costs increased at the county attorney's
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
office which will be ongoing
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
belknap county just recently approved
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
another attorney to help
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
what do you see as the financial aspect
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
in on the counties
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
there are a number of assumptions made
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
when the bill
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
was presented and passed
 
00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:29.190 align:start position:0%
was presented and passed
uh

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
as i say
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of the savings were to be
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
attributed to a an essential
 
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.750 align:start position:0%
attributed to a an essential
element

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
element
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
the success depended on which was early
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
case resolution that we've talked about
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
it really didn't other than strafford
 
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.670 align:start position:0%
it really didn't other than strafford
county

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
the ecr program very frankly is moribund
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the state if it exists at all
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's not really very active
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh the promise that that would we'd see
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
a decrease in recidivism absolutely the
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
opposite we're seeing more return
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
customers at the public defender than
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen historically
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
as far as cost savings and and less time
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
in jails i don't know that is
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
attributable to felonies first as much
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
as it was for the bail reform that took
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
place a couple of years ago
 
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.190 align:start position:0%
place a couple of years ago
uh

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
when case when case loads increase when
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
case laws when cases take longer to
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
resolve caseloads increase
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
the backlog in the case of course has
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
been exacerbated by the pandemic but in
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
2019 i had a meeting at the supreme
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
court where i warned them that
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
and i followed that up a month later
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
with a meeting with the judicial council
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
that felonies first was increasing the
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
time it took to resolve felonies and in
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
october of 2019 public defender program
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
had breached
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
its caseload maximum under its contract
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
with the state of new hampshire
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
i said that it was largely due to
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
felonies first
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
and there were other things to which i
 
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.470 align:start position:0%
and there were other things to which i
can

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
attribute the increase in case loads but
 
00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.670 align:start position:0%
attribute the increase in case loads but
uh

00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
efficiencies were being lost that was my
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
greatest concern and the caseload crisis
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
that has ensued has its roots going back
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
when we
 
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.510 align:start position:0%
when we
i

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
want to hearken back to one thing that
 
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.230 align:start position:0%
want to hearken back to one thing that
uh

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
representative gordon said or someone
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
asked a question and talked about a lot
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
of finger pointing
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think that allocuting fault or blame
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
will simply result in a circular fine
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
firing squad all stakeholders in this
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
had to be absolutely committed to its
 
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.150 align:start position:0%
had to be absolutely committed to its
success

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
success
 
00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.910 align:start position:0%
success
and

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
therefore every stakeholder is partially
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
responsible certain assumptions were
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
wrong but as i say when we have an
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reassess and i think
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're going from here
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
i think that's a fair approach
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
another follow-up
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
further follow-up up
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
currently there's a lot of talk about
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
bail reform and i this seems to be
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
pretty closely associated with that
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
well there's an opportunity the first
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity of course bail will be set
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
particularly in uh
 
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
class a and felony cases for any
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
defendant by a bail bondsman or by the
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
police officer
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
the arresting agency
 
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
but there's an opportunity to address
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
bail at a probable cause hearing
 
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.630 align:start position:0%
bail at a probable cause hearing
uh

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
as far as uh reform of the bail
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
statute as it was last reformed that
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
again is a policy question for the
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
legislature i'd defer i think they're
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
going to hear conflicting information
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
about that as was the case the first
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
time around
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
encourage people to rely on statistical
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
information rather than anecdotal
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
information i've tried to refrain from
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
anecdote in my statements and i think
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
that last time around
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
when i visited some hearings on the bail
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
reform there was a lot of anecdotal
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
information that is
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
while not in individual cases
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
untrustworthy perhaps to base policy on
 
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.150 align:start position:0%
untrustworthy perhaps to base policy on
so

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's worth in that case checking
 
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.190 align:start position:0%
i think it's worth in that case checking
statistics

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
alexis yeah representative simpson
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that there was
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh an increase in rates of recidivism
 
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
and i wondered if you wanted to or if
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
you could talk to whether that's
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
possibly causation or if that's
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
particularly correlation that's always a
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
good question i always am
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
a question is this a cause or is this
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
just a cruel out of fact
 
00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.550 align:start position:0%
just a cruel out of fact
uh

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
i will say this when our cases
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
stay open longer
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
and people are out on bail
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
we have seen an increase of
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
new charges being filed before the
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
initial charges can be resolved
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
and that's one
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
one thing that causes uh
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
problems and again i'm not
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
laying this on the court system i'm not
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
blaming anybody the pandemic as i say
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
has exacerbated all problems that we've
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
seen but when it comes to
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
the simple question of it taking longer
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
to resolve a felony case
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
is longer before someone might as part
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
condition of their sentence go into
 
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:29.990 align:start position:0%
condition of their sentence go into
treatment

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
if that final resolution is deferred
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's more likely they're going to get
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
arrested for uh a new possession of a
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
controlled drug say or commit a new
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
crime a property crime to support their
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
substance use misuse issues uh so
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's an incentive
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
on the part of everyone victims
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
defendants the court system to try to
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
resolve these cases more quickly
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i don't mean to imply that felonies
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
first causes recidivism but it merely
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
the aspect of it that when felonies take
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
longer to resolve
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh to everyone's satisfaction there's a
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
greater likelihood that people will find
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
and do we have one more question no
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay so then if no further questions and
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony thank
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
morning mr chair members of the
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee my name is kate
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
horgan i represent the new hampshire
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
association of counties which is all
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
your elected and appointed officials uh
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
the association did take a position in
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill felonies first
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
is working very well for 70 percent of
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
the counties um
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
and their concern is if we go back
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to start
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
seeing things that you saw before under
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
the old system duplication of paperwork
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
court proceedings and hearings without
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
reaching a substantial
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
substantial resolution of the case
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
felonies should start with the county
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
attorneys rather than police prosecutors
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
it allows county attorneys to have
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
better oversight of the case and this
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
has contributed to better outcomes for
 
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.670 align:start position:0%
has contributed to better outcomes for
everyone

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
i will say there are several county
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
attorneys here so if you have questions
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
i would ask that you
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
take them with them because they can
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
tell you more about process and how
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
things are happening in their particular
 
00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.030 align:start position:0%
things are happening in their particular
counties

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
okay so you will not be taking any
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
i am happy to try but they may be better
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
equipped to answer questions that's no
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%

chair my name is anthony scullimbrini

i'm here testifying in support of hb1597

i'm here on my own i
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
run a law firm in nashua at gillan

skullenbrini and i'm also here on behalf
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire association of criminal
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
innovation in our court system is
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
critical as a service provider that does
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
essential work courts must keep running
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
regardless of circumstances to do this
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
they must embrace change
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
but as with all forms of government in
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
the end those changes must work and if
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
you heard from uh attorney hawks those
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
changes aren't working and i don't have
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
the data that he does because he runs
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
the essentially the largest law firm in
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
the state but my anecdotal experience as
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
a trial lawyer and a criminal defense
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
lawyer for 18 years confirms what he
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
told you
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
felonies first was a huge change and
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
after at least five years of experience
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's safe to say that it doesn't work
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
for the people that are served by the
 
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.510 align:start position:0%
for the people that are served by the
court

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
there are three reasons or three points
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
i want to make about this first it
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
represents an increased workload county
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
attorney's offices were directly
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
impacted by felonies first
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
and in my professional life as a lawyer
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
and in my personal life as friends with
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
other lawyers i can tell you that this
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
increased workload has been difficult
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
their prosecutor's job is hard
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
and turnover is normal but the rate of
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
turnover at the county attorney's
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
offices since felonies versus
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
implemented has skyrocketed
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
this has resulted in many more attorneys
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
per case than before prior to felonies
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
first in my experience it was uncommon
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
to have more than two different
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys on a case now in the county
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
where i practice most hillsborough
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
county two attorneys is about average
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
and on some older cases it's up to four
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
or five i had a trial this november this
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
past november and there have been six
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys on the case
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
turnover is bad for the state it's bad
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
for the defendant it's bad for the
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
victims and it's bad for court it eats
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
up all of the promised time savings that
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
originally motivated felonies first
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
on a personal note i've had many friends
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
who were great attorneys go into and
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
then leave the county attorney's office
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
in fact my law partner is only in my law
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
the increased workload that felonies
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
first represents is great
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
the next thing that i want to bring to
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
the the committee's attention is that it
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
has been less speedy and more expensive
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh the chair estimated that the number
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
was 11
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
of felonies that resolved in district
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
court in my 12 years as a public
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
defender and my six years in private
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
practice obviously the last six years
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
didn't have anything to do with felonies
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
first my experience was that the number
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
was closer to the 37 percent that
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
attorney hawks gave you a vast vast vast
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
plurality of cases especially the
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
low-level felonies were dealt with in
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
district court
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
because felonies first makes that
 
00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:05.829 align:start position:0%
because felonies first makes that
impossible

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
the cost to the defendant and the pace
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
of the case is slowed down for example
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
if you look just at the rules the rules
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
in district court have one or two
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
hearings mandatory and the rules in
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
superior court have many more than that
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
approximately three times the number of
 
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.150 align:start position:0%
approximately three times the number of
hearings

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
as a result this makes the process
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
slower and it makes it more expensive
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
and all of this is true prior to the
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
covid caused backlog
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
the important thing to look at when
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
you're considering this bill
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
is not the time that it took to resolve
 
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
felonies before felonies first and now
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
but the time it took to resolve all
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
felonies including those that were
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
resolved as misdemeanors in the district
 
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.990 align:start position:0%
resolved as misdemeanors in the district
court

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
this goes to a point i wanted to make
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about blame i don't
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
think that it's fair to say that any one
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
party is to blame the county attorneys
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
the defense lawyers the courts the
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
problem was with felonies first is the
 
00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.750 align:start position:0%
problem was with felonies first is the
premise

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
premise
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
the premise was that we could resolve
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
all of these low-level felonies with
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
these high-level felonies and do it
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
equally quickly they basically scooped
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
up the bottom and they put it with the
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
top but my experience as a trial lawyer
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
and i think all the trial lawyers that
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
are going to testify after me would
 
00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.069 align:start position:0%
are going to testify after me would
agree

00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority of the time and
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
energy spent in superior court is
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
dedicated to a very small number of
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
cases domestic violence cases involving
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
serious injury
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
or homicide
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
or sexual assault cases and lumping
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
those very complex victim-centered cases
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
in with cases like low-level possession
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
charges makes no sense that was the
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
fundamental error in thinking behind
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
felonies first the low-level possessions
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
are much more like
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
the misdemeanor cases that the district
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
court deals with than the felony cases
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
that take up 90 of the time in superior
 
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.750 align:start position:0%
that take up 90 of the time in superior
court

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
and this brings me to my last point
 
00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:07.430 align:start position:0%
and this brings me to my last point
i

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%

our court systems when i go on vacation
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
i make a point to find out what the
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
local court looks like if there is a
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer equivalent of a gym rat that is
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
me i will go and watch other people
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
argue i will go and watch other judges
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
rule on cases because i enjoy the legal
 
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.790 align:start position:0%
rule on cases because i enjoy the legal
process

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
but the key thing
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
about the legal process especially in a
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
state like new hampshire is the
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
personnel the people that are involved
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
that make decisions the rules are
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
important but the people matter more and
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's why i think felonies first is not
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
good for everyone it takes away an
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
element of local control
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i want to give you a quick example
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
when i was a public defender i went out
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
to the milford district court and there
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
was a notorious
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
chicken thief
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
that was regularly punished in the
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
milford district court this gentleman
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
was a homeless individual he had pretty
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
serious mental illness and so on hot
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
days when there were barbecues he would
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
walk through the backyards of people's
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
neighbors neighborhoods and he would
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
take chicken off their grill he would
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
never take all their chicken
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
that guy got in trouble a bunch and so
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
the third strike theft law kicked in
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
but the local police officers who knew
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
this guy who understood who he was and
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
why he did what he did and the judge in
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
that case she had seen him as a juvenile
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
and she had been his judge for 20 years
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
she knew when he was having problems she
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
knew when it was serious and when it was
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
just somebody being poor and the
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
punishments that the prosecutors offered
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
and that the judges crafted for this
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
gentleman were different in a way that
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
only local control can allow now when
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
that case goes up to the superior court
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
what you get is a series of emails
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
between the prosecutor and the police
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
department you lose the texture you lose
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
the individuality you lose the
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
personality and the personal knowledge
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
of people in a way that can't be
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
replicated so think about this if i am a
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
drug dealer and i am in downtown
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
manchester and i finish dealing all but
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
like a little bit of my drugs and i get
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
picked up they're going to look at the
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
drug and they're going to look at the
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
weight and they're going to craft a
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
charge based on those two things
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
if i am a drug addict and i have
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
finished most of what i need to
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
supplement my
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know mental illness and my addiction
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
and i get picked up with the exact same
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
drug and the exact same amount
 
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
the police on the streets are the people
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
who will know which person is the drug
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
dealer and which person is the drug
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
addict and they will know that before
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
the defense lawyer before the judge and
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
before the county attorney
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
those people should have input and
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
crafting decisions and i think that when
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
felonies start out in district court
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of information was carried
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
into the case it was brought into the
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
courtroom and it fashioned better faster
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
and just
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
more just results
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
i want to take and answer a couple of
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
questions so there was a question about
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
reverting back
 
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think that because of
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
the way in which this
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
bill is is written and interacts with
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the e-filing provisions it would
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
not be exactly the same so
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
passing this law would not essentially
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
turn out turn back the clock because the
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
e-filing rules that govern superior
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
court make it a little different
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
there was a question about the pc
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
requirement the case is gerstein versus
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
pew and i i know judge gordon knows this
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
i just want to tell the court while
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
there is no hard and fast requirement
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
that you have to have a probable cause
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
hearing if time looks like it's going to
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
be so great then you can get a probable
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
cause hearing and that's what happened
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
in gerstein versus q it was a kentucky
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
case and the guy got held for what ended
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
up being three years pre-trial so there
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
is no explicit you must have a pc
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
hearing but when timetables get long you
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
should get one and that's what the
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
constitution says
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the circuit court overload
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
which i thought was a very real concern
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
in my experience
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
my anecdotal experience matches the
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
numbers that attorney hawks gave you the
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
vast majority of pc hearings were waived
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
and as judge gordon pointed out people
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
act when they have deadlines and i am a
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
firm believer that if you get two
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
lawyers on a case together
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
even if you just get them together on a
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
street corner they're going to make
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
progress on the case and by having a pc
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
hearing even if you don't have it you
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
make progress on the case so having a
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
revert back to district court to do pc
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
hearings is not going to represent a
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
substantial burden the other thing that
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
i want to point out is that our
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
circuit court judges are incredibly deft
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
at handling caseloads and so what they
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
traditionally did in my experience when
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
they had pc hearings is they would take
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
the pc hearing at the beginning of the
 
00:58:12.319 --> 00:58:13.510 align:start position:0%
the pc hearing at the beginning of the
session

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
do the pc hearing and then everybody
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
else would go out and negotiate their
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
case while the pc hearing was coming or
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
was going on and then when the pc
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
hearing ended all of those cases would
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
come in and they would have resolutions
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
ready instead of waiting for lawyers to
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
go resolve the case or wait for their
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
case to get called they use that time
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
really well and i think you know a
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
couple of judges that did it really well
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
the current judge that sits and she sits
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
all over the place but judge chabot who
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
used to be a prosecutor in the hooksett
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
district court she does this even though
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have pc hearings with other
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
hearings that are going to take more
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
time and so if you go to the district
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
court you will see how skilled these
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
people are at spinning 16 plates at once
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that it would add a
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
substantial burden to them the other
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
thing is in talking to prosecutors it
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
would offer some sort of savings because
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
filing cases
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
using the felonies first system
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
especially for police prosecutors
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
represents work so it would essentially
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
take a little bit of that work away and
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
may add a little bit
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of probable cause hearings but
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
the vast vast majority of probable cause
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
hearings were waived and like i said i i
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
was a court rat and i loved having
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
hearings and so it was also a way to
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
build rapport with my client so i had
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
more than the average lawyer but even i
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
was waving something like 90 or 95
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
percent of pc
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
hearings so
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
if there are no other questions uh i'm i
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
would ask for permission to be excused
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
yes you know
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
i guess we we have a question here i'm
 
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:44.829 align:start position:0%
i guess we we have a question here i'm
sorry

00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
know i'm looking at this and i don't
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
know a heck of a lot about the criminal
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
process in courts but
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
is it possible to
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
try lower level
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
felonies in circuit court and then the
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
higher level felonies the really serious
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
ones in superior court so that's an
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
excellent question and that's something
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
that uh people have talked about for a
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
while if you go to our neighbor state to
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
the south
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
and you only go there you know because
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
they might have more restaurants
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
but uh they have a system that has a
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
three-tier approach they have a system
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
that involves
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
that involves misdemeanors concurrent
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
felonies and felonies and so in
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
massachusetts you can get a jury trial
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
on a concurrent felony in some
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances in what would be and it's
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
not a direct equivalent but in what
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
would be similar to our circuit court so
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
that that is something that has tried
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
and it does seem to work again the real
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
flaw with felonies first and your
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
question points this out is that you're
 
01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.990 align:start position:0%
question points this out is that you're
taking

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
cases that are not like each other and
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
you're clumping them together for
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh if there's no other questions
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
01:01:05.839 --> 01:01:07.589 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this

to

the judicial branch at the time felonies
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
first was proposed
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
and we wrote back in 2015 this bill will
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
eliminate the duplicative initiation of
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
a felony case in the district division
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
of the circuit court
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
currently a felony begins by filing a
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
charge in district division of the
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
circuit court where an arraignment by
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
the way 85 percent or so of arraignments
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
were waived
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
an arraignment but it was scheduled
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
100 of the time 85 percent of the time
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
was waived
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
whether an arraignment a bail hearing
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
and a probable cause hearing are
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
scheduled the case is then transferred
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
called bound over in the statutory
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
language through the superior court
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 90 to 120 days after the
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
case has been transferred is then
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
presented to the grand jury for
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
indictment which constitutes a second
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
filing a probable cause and the process
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
begins again in the superior court with
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
an arraignment and a bail hearing
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
the staffs in both courts spend a
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time transferring
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
the case from the district division of
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
circuit court to the superior court and
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
matching the transferred file to the
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
subsequent indictments that come
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
in the superior court
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the staff time that would be saved
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
from uh this new process felonies first
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
was was the reference point
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
in general and i'm going to give you
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
some more statistics and data and i
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
apologize for that a little bit but i
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
think it is useful and it is useful to
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
go back to what we are talking about in
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
2015 with that multiple stage process
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
in that multiple stage process each of
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
those has time each of those has
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
elements of confusion and each of those
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
has elements of mistakes get built into
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
the system and i want to talk briefly
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
about each of those
 
01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:22.549 align:start position:0%
about each of those
so

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
in 2015
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
the time it would take in the circuit
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
court to bound over and i'm talking
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
averages and i'm talking average times
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
to disposition
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
it was about 58 days let's round it up
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
to 60 days
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
so in circuit court by the time it was
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
filed to the time of bound over on
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
average was about two months and that
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
gets you through the arraignment and the
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
other procedural elements that are
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
occurring in circuit court
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
it is then bound over where the file is
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
held nothing can happen on that file
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
once it's bound over into the superior
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
court until an indictment is filed and
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
that indictment then
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
tees up and triggers the the superior
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
court action
 
01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.630 align:start position:0%
court action
and

01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
by rule that has to happen within about
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
90 days sometimes it's less sometimes
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
the 90 days is waived and it's more
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
but in general we'll call it 90 days
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
so we have the 60 days about in superior
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
in in circuit court 90 days in uh in
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
essentially limbo waiting for an
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
indictment so we haven't even started in
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
superior court under the old system
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
and then we get to a superior court and
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
it was about 175 days at that point
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
and that's the average of time of
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
disposition in superior court
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
add those three components up you start
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
in superior in circuit court you bound
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
over you wait for an indictment you then
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
start up again in superior court
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
that was about 323 days
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
average time to disposition
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
we then fast forward to 2019 and as
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
you've heard we have the the 2020 time
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
frame becomes complicated with the
 
01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.630 align:start position:0%
frame becomes complicated with the
pandemic

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
but let's take 2019 by then
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
essentially the shift had been completed
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
in felonies first
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
so if you remember the three steps in in
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
pre-felonies first circuit court bound
 
01:05:21.599 --> 01:05:22.789 align:start position:0%
pre-felonies first circuit court bound
over

01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
sort of uh waiting for indictment and
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
then superior court cases was 323 days
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
in superior court the average timed
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
disposition is 194 days so that total
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
and again talking averages 323 roughly
 
01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:41.390 align:start position:0%
and again talking averages 323 roughly
to

01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
194. if you look at 2020 just to put the
 
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic into perspective that 194 bumps
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
up to 234.
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
so quartz were operating courts are
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
functional during the pandemic
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
everything slows down a little bit so
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit everything becomes a
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
little bit harder
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about what that means in
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
impact on people
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about the victims of crime
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
victims of crime are under the old
 
01:06:13.359 --> 01:06:14.710 align:start position:0%
victims of crime are under the old
system

01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
they have a case that is in circuit
 
01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.589 align:start position:0%
they have a case that is in circuit
court

01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
so so there's a there's a in in county
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
attorney offices you have victim
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
advocates the attorney general's office
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
has a victim advocate
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:30.150 align:start position:0%
you have a
a

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:30.950 align:start position:0%
a
less

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
complete system of victim assistance at
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
the local level some are very good at it
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
some just don't have the capacity to
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
provide victim assistance when you're
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
talking local prosecutors local local
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
departments and again some are very good
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
some just don't have the resources so a
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
victim service is a much different
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
image at the circuit court level than it
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
is at the superior court level when the
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
county's attorney's offices are involved
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
the county attorney victim advocates
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
become involved
 
01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:03.430 align:start position:0%
become involved
and

01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
and the victims of crime have a point of
 
01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.270 align:start position:0%
and the victims of crime have a point of
contact

01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
contact
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
even those where you have a more
 
01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:11.589 align:start position:0%
even those where you have a more
sophisticated

01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
sophisticated
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
locality where in the circuit court you
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
have a victim assistance program
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
there's a change in everything changes
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
from circuit court to superior court it
 
01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:23.910 align:start position:0%
from circuit court to superior court it
is

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
a very confusing time
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
for a victim of crime trying to figure
 
01:07:29.039 --> 01:07:29.750 align:start position:0%
for a victim of crime trying to figure
out

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
why am i now in a different court why do
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
i have different prosecutors why is why
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
do i not have sort of a person that's
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
the same point of contact it creates an
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
element of confusion
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
we also look at it from the perspective
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
of within the administrative office of
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
courts the domestic violence registry so
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
if there is a crime that triggers
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
a crime of domestic violence that
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
triggers a a requirement of reporting
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
to the federal system to the gun line to
 
01:08:01.359 --> 01:08:02.549 align:start position:0%
to the federal system to the gun line to
to

01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
within the various notices
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
when that when that
 
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
initial case is filed and let's say
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
there's a restraining order put into
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
effect or a
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
bail order
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
that is put into effect that requires a
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
report that's reported to our system
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
every time there's a change in the data
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
whether it be a case number whether it
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
be a court whether whatever it may be
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
every time there's a change the domestic
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
violence register a registry has to
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
update the records
 
01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.229 align:start position:0%
update the records
every

01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
it is human nature that mistakes happen
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
the more steps you add the more changes
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
you add the greater the level of
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
complication the greater the risk of
 
01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:49.189 align:start position:0%
complication the greater the risk of
mistakes

01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
01:08:50.789 --> 01:08:50.799 align:start position:0%
file in one place you have fewer
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
mistakes you have the same case number
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
you have the same uh
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
activity so another example on that
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
another change that can happen is in
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
you can have bail conditions that are
 
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.189 align:start position:0%
you can have bail conditions that are
applied

01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
applied
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
that can then that gets bound over to
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
superior court superior court is now
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
waiting gets the indictment
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
there can be new and different
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
conditions placed by the superior court
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
judge because we now have a new new case
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
new look
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
those all have to get
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
added within the domestic violence
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
registry so again more updates more more
 
01:09:27.199 --> 01:09:29.189 align:start position:0%
registry so again more updates more more
complications

01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
complications
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that that was
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier was well you know what
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
happened in circuit court once these
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
cases were were no longer part of
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
felonies first they all went to to
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
circuit court and you've heard some
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion of it is a remarkably busy
 
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.349 align:start position:0%
suggestion of it is a remarkably busy
place

01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
a group of judges that are dealing with
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
on average about
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
125 000 cases a year
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
it is a huge volume of cases that that
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
are in
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
circuit court and they deal with
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
domestic violence there are civil cases
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
there are criminal cases there are
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
guardianship cases adoptions involuntary
 
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.750 align:start position:0%
guardianship cases adoptions involuntary
admissions

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
admissions
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
it is a a remarkable place where
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
i i'm going to get this wrong i think
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
that there are 47 judges
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court dealing with 125
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
000 cases in dealing with
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
with deadlines and cases that have to be
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
dealt with on an expedited basis
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
in 2015
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
there were roughly
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
672 cases that were filed as felonies
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about in terms
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
of the pool in 2015 of what would be
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
felony first cases
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
so what is being proposed is a shift of
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
let's add and again i'm not the the
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
number today might be different than the
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
number in 2015 but let's say they were
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
equal we're adding 6 000 more cases to
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
the circuit court system
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
and then there was a question about bail
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
reform and there's some there's some
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
legislation about bail reform um and
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know last year it was senate bill 92
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
this year senator bradley has a has a
 
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.189 align:start position:0%
this year senator bradley has a has a
bill

01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
that would require um
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
that would prevent a bail from uh from
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
being done through a bail commissioner
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
that would have to be held and you have
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
to have a bail hearing in circuit court
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's another so if something like that
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
passes we're talking another 3 000 cases
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
in in circuit court that are not
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
currently pending every time there's
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
sort of a change and there's an addition
 
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.030 align:start position:0%
sort of a change and there's an addition
to

01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
cases in the circuit court you're adding
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
to what is already a stressed system and
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
you're adding to an already stressed
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
system today in a period of covid
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
a system that is stressed a little
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
bumped up because of covet
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
you have staff shortages
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
similar to everybody else i'm not going
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
to say that the issues that you heard
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
and that you will hear are not real
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
obviously we've heard of of amazing and
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
just tremendous stresses in the public
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
defender's office you hear that in the
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the in the county attorneys all of
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
those are real and they're also real in
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
the in the circuit court
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
things to to also think about is you
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
know some of the data about
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
you know felonies the percentage of
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
felonies that were resolved
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
pre-felonies first and post-felonies
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
first and that comes down
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
you also then have to look at similar
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
question that was raised before
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
was felonies first the cause of that
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
because the other aspect of of what
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
felonies first does is
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
it brings in a more sophisticated i'll
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
use that term loosely
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
charging process where the county
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys are involved at the beginning
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
and it very well could be and probably
 
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.310 align:start position:0%
and it very well could be and probably
is

01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
that cases that were being charged as
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
felonies are getting a slightly more
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
thorough look and they're being charged
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
as misdemeanors there's nothing that
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
prohibits a charge from going as a
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor if that case is truly a
 
01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.350 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor if that case is truly a
misdemeanor

01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
and the other aspect and the other thing
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind is
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
a a case filed as a felony in the
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
circuit court cannot get resolved as a
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
felony in the circuit court
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
if that is going to be settled as a
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
felony it's going to superior court you
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors are the ones that get
 
01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.470 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors are the ones that get
resolved

01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
in circuit court so if it's being pled
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
down to a misdemeanor it can get
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
resolved in circuit court but if it's
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
being pled as a misdemeanor you're going
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
over to superior court in superior court
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
resolve a case as either a felony or a
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor sometimes those cases are
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
null processed and sent back to circuit
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
court which creates a whole different
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
sort of process problem
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
but in superior court you can and and
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
frequently do seek cases that were filed
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
as felonies resolving as as misdemeanors
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
one of the other questions that was
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
raised are
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
is essentially are we going back and
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
reverting to identical situations uh
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
pre-felonies first 2015
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
one of the significant changes that has
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
occurred and there was a reference to it
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
is e-filing so electronic filing is is
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
what's happening in superior court is
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
not the same in circuit court the old
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
days bound over was the clerk in circuit
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
court took that file and brought it over
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
to superior court it was sort of a
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
physical process not actually sure how
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
today we would figure it out
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
and and and
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear we're not taking a
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
position on the policy of this bill we
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
do and are providing information and
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
testimony as to sort of the impacts
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
because those impacts
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
um uh correlate to sort of your
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
decision-making process
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
the addition of electronic filing sort
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
of creates this level of of complexity
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
that did not exist
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
pre-2015 when felonies first went into
 
01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.430 align:start position:0%
pre-2015 when felonies first went into
effect

01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
because ultimately
 
01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:24.390 align:start position:0%
because ultimately
the

01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.590 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
you know how that file who is going to
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
electronically file and how it's going
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
to get electronically filed will have to
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
figure out but there just may be there
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
are complications associated with that i
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
guess is the is the easiest way to to
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the last thing i'll
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
note is
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
you know there are opportunities to
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
resolve in superior court
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
early case resolution if there if there
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be some changes to that great
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean you you take away
 
01:15:58.630 --> 01:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
felonies first it doesn't mean you sort
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
of revert back to 2015 it means okay
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
let's look at the process and if there
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
are tweaks that need to be done we can
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
we can manage that but those
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities do exist and they are real
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
and i get everybody's incredibly busy
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
and i get it's hard to sort of think
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
about a case that's not in front of you
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
because you don't have a deadline today
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
but the you know there is early case
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
resolution as you heard earlier there
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
there are actually more
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
sort of hearings that occur in superior
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
court you can always get to resolution
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
at any of those
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
um and and cases are resolving
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
and i think on an overall basis they are
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
resolving in terms of if you look at
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
time of disposition
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
in a shorter period of time
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
on average some are longer some are
 
01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.590 align:start position:0%
on average some are longer some are
shorter

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
shorter
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
and you avoid
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
the three-step
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
process of
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
filing in circuit court having your
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
hearings in circuit court
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
then saying okay this is still a felony
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to bound it over we're going
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
to bind it over to
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
spirit court it's going to hang in
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
superior court for a little while
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
until we get an indictment and then
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to resolve it
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
and that that sort of multi-step
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
process which creates confusion
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity for errors
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
um is is gone
 
01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.510 align:start position:0%
um is is gone
um

01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd be happy to
 
01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.669 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd be happy to
uh

01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr head yes
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
representative chase thank you very much
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you attorney head for
 
01:17:36.239 --> 01:17:37.270 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you attorney head for
taking

01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
my question i'm i'm a little confused
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
you said um
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
that you're not really
 
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this yet it sounded
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
to me very opposed i also wanted to know
 
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
not that you could do what you want i'm
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
just that's the way it came across to me
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
with all the statistics that you're
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
this using the electronic filing
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
actually simplify things and take out
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
some of those steps
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
where the high-level felonies would not
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
be significant
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the cases could be resolved
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
without going through all of the the
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
process and the steps that you told
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
about the 60 days 90 days in the 175.
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question um
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
relative to the first one we don't you
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
know there are policy issues relative to
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not we we go stick with
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
felonies first or not
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
that policy thing is what i'm saying we
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
are not taking a position on i do and
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
the purpose of my testimony is there is
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
a significant negative impact on the
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
circuit court if this were to pass
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
and that's i think important for you to
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
know as legislators because ultimately
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
that policy decision you're going to
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
make is going to have if you choose to
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
to go with this bill is going to have a
 
01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.110 align:start position:0%
to go with this bill is going to have a
significant

01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
potential impact on the circuit court
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
system so i think it is important for
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
you to understand to know
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
the current stresses that exist in the
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
circuit court system
 
01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.350 align:start position:0%
circuit court system
and

01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
in in sort of how
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
the reversion back to the old system
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
essentially creates this this thing that
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
that we were trying to fix back in 2015.
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
so so while i don't have a position on
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
the policy per se i do have a
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know i do think it's important and i
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
do and i agree with you there's my
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
information has been negative in the
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
sense of of the
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
of this bill because this bill has a
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
negative impact but ultimately that is a
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
fair to say it's a legislative decision
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
on whether you know the policy is it
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
outweighs that negative impact
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
as your other question i may i'm not
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
sure i fully understood it but the
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
e-filing is simply the way in which the
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
the case is put into the the superior
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
court system
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty becomes one circuit
 
01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:02.310 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty becomes one circuit
court

01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
would have
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
it's not clear who's actually going to
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
e-file what is in
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
circuit court because we're not a party
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
but the circuit court would either
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
e-file it somehow into the superior
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
court or the superior court would take
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
the paper file
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
scan it but they don't have a file
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
number yet their files don't open until
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
the indictment
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
so the the superior court process begins
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
with the indictment
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
so they have a file with no home until
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
there's an indictment
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
so it just creates some logistical
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
questions as to sort of what do you do
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
um and and yes we would figure it out
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
but it's not
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:20:41.679 --> 01:20:42.709 align:start position:0%
it's not
simple

01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
um and and we would also have to then
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
sort of work with the e-filing system
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
and the vendor for that as to exactly
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
how that all works
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
and their expenses associated with that
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
we did have a fiscal note
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
it's indeterminable
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
because it is always it's hard to know
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know our our our estimate is that
 
01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:04.229 align:start position:0%
you know our our our estimate is that
the

01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
impact will be greatest in the four
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
busiest circuit courts
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
um so you're you're essentially talking
 
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
manchester uh concord keene
 
01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.629 align:start position:0%
manchester uh concord keene
nashua

01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
area but doesn't mean they're not
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
impacts everywhere but we highlighted
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
those as as
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
where we would have the greatest fiscal
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
impact and
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
both in terms of of judicial resources
 
01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:27.590 align:start position:0%
both in terms of of judicial resources
and

01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
clerk staff resources you know the just
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
the volume of of material that comes
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
through circuit court is astronomical uh
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
and and just the management of files
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh is is difficult the scheduling
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
getting you know these hearings
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
scheduled the other the other aspect of
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
of sort of the the
 
01:21:48.639 --> 01:21:49.990 align:start position:0%
of sort of the the
um

01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
the initial arrangements is or i'm sorry
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
probable cause hearings is they are
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
100 scheduled 85 waived
 
01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.070 align:start position:0%
100 scheduled 85 waived
um

01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
in that process though you still have to
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
frequently waived on the day of
 
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
or or thereabouts um so you have
 
01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.629 align:start position:0%
or or thereabouts um so you have
uh

01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
local prosecutors assuming because they
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
have to assume there's a hearing even
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
though it's not going forward you have
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
victims who are assuming there's going
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
to be hearing that doesn't go forward um
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
you it it creates confusion um
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
in the in the system in spirit court you
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
don't have that required
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to have it you have to ask
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
system and it it does
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
have a an inherent benefit and
 
01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.030 align:start position:0%
have a an inherent benefit and
efficiency

01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
in the sense of
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
not having to assume
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
until it's until it's taken off that
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you very much thank you thank
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
you for letting me testify
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
my name is jim moyer and
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
i want to speak in favor of the bill
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
i live in canterbury
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
i work out of concord i've been a
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyer for
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
approximately 38 years
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
first 10 years i was a public defender
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire public defender program
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
after that as in private practice but
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
also did contract work
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i feel i'm very familiar with the
 
01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.750 align:start position:0%
and i feel i'm very familiar with the
system

01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
back when the felony's first
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
legislation was contemplated back in
 
01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.790 align:start position:0%
legislation was contemplated back in
2015

01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
2015
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
i must admit i was skeptical of it
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons and indeed
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
virtually every practitioner both
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and defense attorney i knew
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
at that time was skeptical as well
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i think my skepticism has been borne
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
out by many of the statistics you've
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
heard already
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
i i want to tell you though i'm speaking
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
strictly anecdotally from my own
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
experience in the system i don't have
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
the figures and facts others have been
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
providing those to you but i but i i i
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
think what i've experienced is reflected
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
in those numbers
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
the issue really is the cultures between
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
and judge gordon talked about this the
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
culture is very different between the
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
circuit court and the superior court
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
as you've heard many times your circuit
 
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:28.639 align:start position:0%
court is very active lots of cases going
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
through i would say that circuit courts
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
are are very nimble
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
they use their time efficiently they
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
move things along and everybody sort of
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
agrees let's get the cases going
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
whichever case it is whether it's small
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
claims or criminal violation i mean
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
indeed they deal with speeding tickets
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
you know the most minor stuff but they
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
do it efficiently superior court
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
generally has dealt with more serious
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
cases and it's more deliberative it's
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
more ponderous i'd say it definitely
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
moves moves more slowly
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
this is why when i when i when judge
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
gordon talked about this and attorney
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
hawks as well
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
having the felonies start in the
 
01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
district court
 
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
because you have the preliminary and the
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
probable cause you're scheduled
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
everyone has a deadline to look at
 
01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.030 align:start position:0%
everyone has a deadline to look at
and

01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
many of these cases in my experience
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
personally it's been at least 50 percent
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
of the felonies were resolved in the
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
district report level um that's a huge
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
amount and it's done very quickly and
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
very efficiently and that's really what
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
i want to stress here
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
um the way it worked and the way we had
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
it going for
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
i have no idea certainly as long as i
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
practice probably a hundred years doing
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
it the way we did prior to felonies
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
first it worked and i really felt at the
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
time that felonies first was a solution
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
looking for a problem
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
it was it was working there was no
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
reason to change it everything can
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
always be tweaked but again it was an
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
experiment that didn't work
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so basically i wanted to say that i'm
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
in favor of this legislation i thought
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
the way it worked before was great
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
worked well let's go back to it
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%

practicing only criminal law since 2000.

i was a public defender before moving to
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
being a prosecutor i practice in circuit
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%

scotland briny
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
gave you some of their observations and
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
numbers i'm not going to repeat them i
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
was going to use some of their numbers
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
in my in my presentation attorney hawks
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
and i spoke a little bit monday
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
for probably a half hour 40 minutes
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
about those specific statistics uh and i
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
have no issue with his uh with his
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
numbers they parallel some of the
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
numbers that uh that i was able to uh
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
turn out from my
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
um case management software
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
what we've done
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
with felonies first
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
in my opinion is create an artificial
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
choke point
 
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
at the superior courts
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
you've heard the term many hands make
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
easy work
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
what we've done we've taken all the
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
felony cases that origin used to
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
originate in the circuit courts
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
and move them up to the superior courts
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
in the first instance
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
that has forced everything through that
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
funnel of superior court
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
you've heard about some of the
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
resolution numbers
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
um from mr hawks mr mr skull and briny
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
touched on them uh briefly uh and and
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned with
 
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.390 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned with
the

01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
length of time cases are open and the
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
decrease in resolution uh numbers uh
 
01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.830 align:start position:0%
decrease in resolution uh numbers uh
from

01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
2000 early teens data
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
from the court system
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
they had commented that the number of
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
felonies percent of felonies resolved in
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%

and sullivan county 19
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
that comes from the court's own data
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
from the early part of the 2000s
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
felonies first anecdotally i believe
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
that that again there was artificial
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
choke point up at the superior courts
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
when i became county attorney a little
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
more than a year ago i started looking
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
at at the number of hearings we've been
 
01:28:48.719 --> 01:28:50.229 align:start position:0%
at at the number of hearings we've been
having

01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
just in final number of charges filed
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
for felonies i ran these numbers
 
01:28:54.639 --> 01:28:55.669 align:start position:0%
for felonies i ran these numbers
recently

01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
recently
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
in 2016 we filed 981 felonies that's
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
pretty much pre-felony's first righteous
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
felonies first was beginning to roll out
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we filed 1235 felony cases
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
felonies only
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
now remember each of those felonies
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
from felonies first may have an
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
attendant misdemeanor so the case
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
numbers are are dramatically higher but
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
i'm talking just felonies so between 19
 
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
2016 and 2021
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
we've increased about 254 charges about
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
26 percent
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's a dramatic increase and the only
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
increa the only difference is felonies
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
first um anecdotally i do not believe
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
the crime rate has gone up for felonies
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
by 25 in merrimack county during that
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
same time period
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
we looked at court dates
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh time in court between 2016 i should
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
say we i should say aye
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
between 2016 and 2021
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
i looked at two events arraignments and
 
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.270 align:start position:0%
i looked at two events arraignments and
bail

01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
bail
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
arraignment days
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
one arraignment one day in court in 2016
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
was 776
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
an arraignment event counting as an
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
arraignment day in 2021
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
went up to 923. that's an increase or
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
just shy of 20 of 20
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
um and again the only common factor for
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
those numbers is felonies first when we
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
look at bail hearings
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
this is the dramatic increase for bail
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
hearings we went from 254 court days
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
in 2016
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
to 452 court days in 2021. that's an
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
increase of just under 78 percent and
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
that's just in merrimack county court
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
the ripple effect with the other courts
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to bet uh if not close at
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
least parallel those individual numbers
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
mr hawkes presented the data
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
regarding the weeks to resolve felony
 
01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:54.550 align:start position:0%
regarding the weeks to resolve felony
cases

01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
between 2015 and 2020
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
he was reluctant to comment about the in
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
the number of weeks to resolve the case
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
in 20 and 21 obviously for coveted
 
01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:05.590 align:start position:0%
in 20 and 21 obviously for coveted
reasons

01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
but i was talking to a couple of the
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
attorneys in the office the other day
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
regarding some of these numbers that mr
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
hawkes had provided me on monday and
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
presented to you earlier today
 
01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.350 align:start position:0%
presented to you earlier today
and

01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
one of the attorneys commented that even
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
during the onset of the pandemic
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
the circuit courts were doing many many
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
telephonic hearings
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
and they were resolving cases
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
telephonically with submitted paperwork
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
from public defenders and retained
 
01:31:28.719 --> 01:31:30.390 align:start position:0%
from public defenders and retained
counsel

01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
what that means is had a felony
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
originated in my observation had a
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
felony originated in a circuit court
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
and they were able to resolve a
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor resolution
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
for the less serious offenses
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
those cases could have been resolved
 
01:31:46.159 --> 01:31:47.430 align:start position:0%
those cases could have been resolved
earlier

01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
but they were not because of some of the
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
court processes that were involved with
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
the with the superior court so that was
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
another impact of
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
of felonies first
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
i i found interesting mr hawk's number
 
01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:03.910 align:start position:0%
i i found interesting mr hawk's number
of

01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh the number of district court
 
01:32:05.199 --> 01:32:06.550 align:start position:0%
uh the number of district court
resolutions

01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
resolutions
 
01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.390 align:start position:0%
resolutions
um

01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the uh regarding felonies in 2015. he
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned the numbers um 37 percent
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
resolved in merrimack county 18 weeks
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
quicker than after felonies first
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
that tells me
 
01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.629 align:start position:0%
that tells me
that

01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
that felonies first was again the only
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
common denominator
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
in that in his analysis for all of his
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
statistical numbers was felonies first
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
that just reinforces the choke point
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh point that i'm that i'm bringing out
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
regarding everything now originating up
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
in superior courts
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
i listened with with interest to some of
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
the prior testimony i made some notes
 
01:32:45.199 --> 01:32:45.990 align:start position:0%
the prior testimony i made some notes
that

01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
that i want to comment on one is
 
01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:51.270 align:start position:0%
that i want to comment on one is
gatekeeping

01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
gatekeeping
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned that the county
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys are are
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
involved sooner with felonies first
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
well that may have been the hope
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you that the gatekeeper
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
now for a felony charge is the police
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
department and the bail commissioner
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i say that because a police officer
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
will arrest for whatever charges are
 
01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.310 align:start position:0%
will arrest for whatever charges are
applicable

01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
and then he has probable cause for
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh when he makes the when he affects the
 
01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:17.669 align:start position:0%
uh when he makes the when he affects the
arrest

01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
if it's a felony and a bail commissioner
 
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
bails that person to appear in superior
 
01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.310 align:start position:0%
bails that person to appear in superior
court

01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
that's what starts the superior court
 
01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.910 align:start position:0%
that's what starts the superior court
docket

01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
docket
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that that because of
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
the choke point
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
in superior court
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
the superior court in my in my
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
observations is having a difficult
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
difficult time keeping up with some of
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
the administrative process
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a recent example
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
there was individual arrested earlier in
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
january earlier this month
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
he has an arraignment scheduled
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
for today
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
as of yesterday the court didn't have a
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
daca number for him
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
that means that my office is unable to
 
01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.390 align:start position:0%
that means that my office is unable to
file

01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
file
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
any charge
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
in superior court because we cannot
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
electronically file it without a docket
 
01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.470 align:start position:0%
electronically file it without a docket
number

01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
now do i know where that paperwork is i
 
01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.669 align:start position:0%
now do i know where that paperwork is i
don't

01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:34:09.679 --> 01:34:10.629 align:start position:0%
don't
but

01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:34:12.149 --> 01:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
we have to ask ourselves a bigger
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
question as society is that defendant
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
getting getting justice if i can't file
 
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
a complaint
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
in a speedy manner because process is
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
not being uh because the the paperwork
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
is not being processed to open it at a
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
superior court is that is is that a good
 
01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.270 align:start position:0%
superior court is that is is that a good
thing

01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
i think not
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's just a recent observation
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
another recent observation regarding
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
electronic issues
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
the backlog and workload and my
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
observations at superior court
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
are are so high we're having difficulty
 
01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.790 align:start position:0%
are are so high we're having difficulty
getting

01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
final orders out after a resolution
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you a recent impact for that
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
we had we had a final order come to us
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
almost four months after sentencing
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
that individual was ordered to be on
 
01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.430 align:start position:0%
that individual was ordered to be on
probation

01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
probation
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
probation never knew he was on probation
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
we never knew
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
that the uh we never received the final
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
order so without a final order there is
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
no final order
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
we could not talk to the probation guys
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
we can tell them you can expect them
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
waiting on a final order
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
that individual never reported to a
 
01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.990 align:start position:0%
that individual never reported to a
probation

01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
probation
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
four months four-month period
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
that because of a backlog at the courts
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
and getting orders out
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
that that individual went that's i don't
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
say missing but i'll say without
 
01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.870 align:start position:0%
say missing but i'll say without
resolution

01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
now again as society i don't think
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
i think he i think as a defendant he's
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
expecting that to be
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
his case to be resolved and updated he
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
resolves it in court
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think the defense attorney is
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
expecting to get an order in a timely
 
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:46.950 align:start position:0%
expecting to get an order in a timely
manner

01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
manner
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
i think the uh the the state i'm
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
certainly expecting to get to get an
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
order in a timely manner and the impact
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
there was obviously a person wasn't
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
being supervised who a judge thought
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
ought to be supervised when from the
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
bench he
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
indicated he was going to order a period
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
of probation
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.109 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
there was some talk about
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
other counties
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
and i know a wmur report
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
between judge
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
showed a conversation between judge
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
coughlin and judge delker down in
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
and that conversation had to do with um
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh basically
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
doing triage for lack of a better term
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
with cases prior to coming to superior
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
court they were talking
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
generally about the backlogs and
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
difficulties and and
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
staffing and i couldn't agree with it
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
with the comments more um
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
that the circuit court is definitely a
 
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
triage court for low for lower hang
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
felony issues
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
and with this change in legislation
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it puts us back where we
 
01:36:53.679 --> 01:36:55.030 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it puts us back where we
were

01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
prior to felonies first
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
now i can tell you that that the court
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
administrative rules the court rules
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
it won't be difficult in my estimation
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
for the court rules to be reinstated
 
01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.070 align:start position:0%
for the court rules to be reinstated
and

01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
they they had the historical documents
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
for those court rules
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
so those should be not heavy lifting for
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
the courts and plus the the lead in time
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
is great enough that i think that
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to to accommodate that
 
01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.510 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to to accommodate that
um

01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
attorney head talked about 58 days to
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
bind overs
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
out of the out of the circuit courts
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
one thing to realize in the circuit
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
courts again having done
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
probably hundreds of probable cause
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
hearings and dealt with attorneys on
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
many many many felony cases
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
for a local prosecutor to coordinate
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office and count in
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
resolutions of those uh uh
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
more appropriate for resolution cases in
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
in circuit court
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
routinely as a lower level prosecutor
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'd pick up the phone and call the
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office and say hey
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
attorney jones
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
i have mr smith this is the facts of
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
case are you okay with me resolving it
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
we banter it back back and forth we talk
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
about possible resolutions they'd give
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
me the okay i'd start negotiations with
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
defense counsel off times a probable
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
cause hearing may be moved one or two
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
times but ultimately resolve in the in
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
the lower court
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
more common
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
um than uh than most people would would
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
think and again the numbers that tony
 
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
hawks presented earlier
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
beared that out
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
bears that out
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
mr gordon representative gordon
 
01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.750 align:start position:0%
mr gordon representative gordon
mentioned

01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
and several people that testified
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier intervention
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think i can emphasize that
 
01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.870 align:start position:0%
i don't think i can emphasize that
enough

01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
the local courts really have a good feel
 
01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:54.790 align:start position:0%
the local courts really have a good feel
on

01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh individuals that are before the court
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis they really do
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
the local judge sees them on a regular
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
basis local prosecutor sees them on a
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
regular basis they have a feel for
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
what's needed for a decent resolution a
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
just resolution an appropriate
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
resolution for the individual
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
and with the programs that are available
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
in the lower courts they can institute
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
that much quicker than they can at the
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
and that includes mental health
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
on a policy basis
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
where the work needs to be performed and
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with it you have to
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
weigh that against
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
what amounts to and i'll be blunt about
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
this what amounts to the liberty
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
interests of of a defendant
 
01:39:53.199 --> 01:39:54.070 align:start position:0%
interests of of a defendant
now

01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
to be quite blunt about it i take the
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
liberty entrance of the people that i
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
prosecute that our office prosecutes
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
very seriously
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and so does everybody in my office i
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
drive that point uh
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
home hard with the 17 attorneys that
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
work in my office
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
and uh and and i think
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
that if there's a cost
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
to ensure the liberty interests of
 
01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.149 align:start position:0%
to ensure the liberty interests of
defendants

01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
defendants
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
are protected we should absorb it end of
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
the end of discussion
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
felonies first as it was as it was
 
01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.390 align:start position:0%
felonies first as it was as it was
anticipated

01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
hoped to assist in that
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh to to meet that goal it didn't work
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's not working
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
so i support the bill
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
um and i gladly answer any questions
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
that anyone may uh may have
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions from the
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
committee oh we do representative chase
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's
 
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
more of a um
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a concern you used a example of
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
a person who was sentenced and no final
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
order was sent down
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the probation so he was just out or
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
he she the person was out unsupervised
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
am i incorrect that when someone is
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
sentenced that aren't they usually taken
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
back to a holding cell or somewhere
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
until then his sentence didn't involve a
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh a a stan committed sentence so he
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
basically walked out of courtroom on
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
that day
 
01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:26.310 align:start position:0%
that day
so

01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
with the final order uh he would have
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
been ordered to report to probation but
 
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
that final order again was delayed so
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
one follow-up just i just want to
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
understand all of this thank you very
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
much so where did the ball kind of drop
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
was it because of the backload that the
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
paperwork didn't get done and just how
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
often does this happen specifically
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
i i can't say where the ball dropped
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
between the courtroom
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh colloquy with the judge and and the
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
plea being entered and approved to and
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
us getting the electronic order of the
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
court i don't know if
 
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
where within the courthouse it fell
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
but we didn't receive it for four months
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
and um all of our court documents are
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
dated when they're transmitted to us
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
electronically at the bottom of the dock
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
of the document
 
01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:15.990 align:start position:0%
of the document
and

01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:16.790 align:start position:0%
and
the

01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:17.750 align:start position:0%
the
order

01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh is dated on the date at the end of
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
his plea but the transmission date to us
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
was that three and a half four months
 
01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:26.709 align:start position:0%
was that three and a half four months
later

01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
we all set any further questions
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you very much for your
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes andrew
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
laverne hey five pronouns
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
i was very close not quite okay thank
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
committee my name is andrew livernoise i
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
am the belknap county attorney
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
and i am here to testify despite my
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
friendship with attorney halverson
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
let me begin by saying that i recognize
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
that felonies first which was
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
established in 2016 is not perfect
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
it has failed in
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
several ways to provide all the benefits
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
that it was promised it has
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
significantly increased caseloads for
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
county attorneys offices there is no
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
doubt about that uh it has increased the
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
caseload of my office tremendously
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
i've been lucky in that my delegation
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
has supported my office despite these
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
changes we saw it coming my predecessor
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
saw it coming back in 2015.
 
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
we added extra staff to our uh we added
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
an extra assistant county attorney in
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
2016 in anticipation of the increased
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
caseload this year the delegation is
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
providing me with another assistant
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
county attorney so i won't pretend that
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
it has not had attendant costs on the
 
01:43:48.639 --> 01:43:50.709 align:start position:0%
it has not had attendant costs on the
county

01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
but having said that i think it would be
 
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
a serious mistake to dismantle the
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
felony's first program
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
and to go back to the way cases were
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
handled previously
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
and my reason for saying that uh has to
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
do with
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
well let me say i think it is
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
felonies first has
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
improved our ability to prosecute felony
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
cases effectively and efficiently and to
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
provide justice in a way that is
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
supportive to victims
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
in my office we have now adjusted to
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
this new system we're used to this new
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
system i have office protocols and
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
policies in place to deal with the new
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
pro this new system and to try to
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
dismantle it and go back to the old way
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
of doing business i think would be a
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
mistake and to see why
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
my focus is on the serious cases and
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's where i think felonies first is
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
really most important
 
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
because i think you have to think about
 
01:44:43.590 --> 01:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
what happens in a smaller rural
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
community when a serious crime occurs
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
let's say it is a serious domestic
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
violence case involving a bodily injury
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
a sexual assault case or a non-fatal
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
shooting case
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
under the current system under felonies
 
01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:58.310 align:start position:0%
under the current system under felonies
first

01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
if the when the police make an arrest in
 
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
that case and the defendant is held
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
overnight my office
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
knows about that case at eight o'clock
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
the next morning
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
my office can immediately get involved
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
in the case
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
we are reaching out to the police
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
department to get relevant documents
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
we're reviewing those documents we're
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
working with the police department to
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
help get additional evidence to maybe
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
help them decide about
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
getting search warrants things like that
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
and then either i or one of my assistant
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
county attorneys who i've hired
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
trained supervised is going to make the
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
decision about what crimes to charge in
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
that case
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
and we're going to draft those charging
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
documents and we're going to file those
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
documents electronically and we're going
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
to be involved right from the beginning
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
and under felonies first the same lawyer
 
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
will handle that case from beginning to
 
01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:48.870 align:start position:0%
will handle that case from beginning to
end

01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
end
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
and i think that's important that
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
principle is known as vertical
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
prosecution where one prosecutor handles
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
the case from the beginning all the way
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
to the end it's considered i think best
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
practices around the country
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
and most uh i think many prosecution
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
agencies around the country use a
 
01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
vertical integration system
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
what else happens right away that first
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
that first morning however
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
in my office i have two full-time victim
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
witness advocates and on a serious case
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
involving victims that first morning my
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
victim witness advocates are reaching
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
out to those victims to give them
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
services to make sure they understand
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
the court process to see if they want to
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
be involved in the bail decision to see
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
if they want to be involved in the bail
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
hearing that's going to take place that
 
01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:34.390 align:start position:0%
hearing that's going to take place that
day

01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
in my county
 
01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:40.470 align:start position:0%
in my county
the

01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
local police departments don't have
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
victim with victim witness advocates
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that my office be
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
involved immediately and that my victim
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
would his advocates be involved
 
01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.229 align:start position:0%
would his advocates be involved
immediately

01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
if felonies first were dismantled we
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
went back to the old way of doing things
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
it means those preliminary parts of the
 
01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:00.550 align:start position:0%
it means those preliminary parts of the
case

01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
the charging decisions
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
the bail hearing the probable cause
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
hearing the notifications to victims
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
would most likely revert back to
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
the police prosecutors who handled those
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
cases previously those police
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
prosecutors who are hired by and
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
employed by the police departments
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
now i don't
 
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
want in any way to disparage the work of
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
the local police prosecutors in my
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
county i work closely with all of them i
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
respect all of them they do terrific and
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
outstanding work but ultimately i'm
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for the all criminal
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
prosecutions in my county and i don't
 
01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:37.189 align:start position:0%
prosecutions in my county and i don't
have

01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
day-to-day supervision over the local
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
police prosecutors
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
and on a serious felony charge involving
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
a victim i want my attorneys to be
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
now alternatively
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
it might be argued that i could simply
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
assign my staff
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
to do those preliminary parts on the
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
serious felonies in the lower district
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
courts but that means now i have to be
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
sending my
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys to multiple district courts
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the county we have a district
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
court over in franklin we have a
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
district court in laconia it means my
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutors now have to be juggling
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
different court procedures in different
 
01:48:14.719 --> 01:48:15.830 align:start position:0%
different court procedures in different
courtrooms

01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
courtrooms
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
i would prefer to have it all take place
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
in the superior court in my
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
in the same building where we work
 
01:48:22.639 --> 01:48:23.590 align:start position:0%
in the same building where we work
now

01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh there's been a lot of talk about the
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
fact that because felonies first
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
has moved all the cases to superior
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
court the sort of low-hanging fruit
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the low-level drug cases and things
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
like that aren't being resolved uh as
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
quickly and i understand that has been a
 
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
concern but what we are doing in my
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
county is my prosecutors were working to
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
try to be more nimble like the
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in district court were
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
we are trying to resolve cases as early
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
as we can we are trying to negotiate
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
early with uh with defense counsel move
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
cases back to district court when they
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
really should be misdemeanors plead
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
cases out as misdemeanors early
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
for felonies first to work you have to
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
have an effective ecr program and i
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
think if there's any flaw in felonies
 
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
first that's the biggest flaw is that
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
the ecr program has not always been as
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
robust as it should be and if we were
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
going to try to change something my
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be to improve the
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
ecr program
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
rather than eliminate felonies first
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
additionally if you were to dismantle
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
felonies first i think there are
 
01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.390 align:start position:0%
felonies first i think there are
additional

01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.669 align:start position:0%
additional
uh

01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
drawbacks or
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
costs resulting just from the change
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
over itself
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
at this point all of the police
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
departments in my county are used to
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
felonies first they've been trained on
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
how to do felonies first what paperwork
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be filed where it needs to be
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
filed by what time it needs to be sent
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
in we've created case management
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
programs to effectively handle the flow
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
of felony cases from beginning to end
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
all of that would have to be altered if
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
you were to undo felonies first
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
none of my attorneys have ever worked
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
under the old system so all of my
 
01:50:05.199 --> 01:50:06.390 align:start position:0%
under the old system so all of my
attorneys

01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
would basically be learning this new
 
01:50:08.239 --> 01:50:11.109 align:start position:0%
would basically be learning this new
system

01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
which is now going to the old system
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
so rather than
 
01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
undoing the felony's first program i
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
would recommend that this
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
that instead we undertake a systematic
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
examination of the sorts of changes we
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
can make to make this program work
 
01:50:25.119 --> 01:50:26.629 align:start position:0%
can make to make this program work
better

01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
and be more effective
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
and with that i would uh oh i should
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
also point out that
 
01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:34.639 align:start position:0%
as the association of counties has
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
the majority of the county attorneys in
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
would prefer not to see felonies first
 
01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.030 align:start position:0%
would prefer not to see felonies first
dismantled

01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
dismantled
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
claire um would you
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
do you have handouts for us
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
i have um
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
i apologize i didn't print out handouts
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
for you i submitted written testimony
 
01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
which is largely mirrored with what i
 
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
just said which i put on the portal
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh you have a
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
so it's on the portal
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
um if you would like i could uh after
 
01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
today i could print them out and send
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
them to you but i didn't bring them with
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
me if you could email them
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
i will email them then to the committee
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you networks
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
next the chair will recognize bob lynn
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i i when i
 
01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify i you know said do
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
you support or oppose and i basically
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
said i i don't take a position either
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
way but i am concerned
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
and and one of the things i hope this
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
committee will do i
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
i i want to emphasize here that i am not
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
suggesting in any way that anybody
 
01:51:59.830 --> 01:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
um you know has has
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
has sort of tried to mislead you at all
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
i don't mean i have great respect for
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
everybody that's testified here but it
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
sounds like
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
you've gotten
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
really kind of conflicting numbers
 
01:52:12.159 --> 01:52:13.189 align:start position:0%
really kind of conflicting numbers
on

01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
whether they're you know whether it has
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
taken longer for cases to be
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
disposed of under the old system or
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
under the new system and i'm
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know again i have no doubt that the
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
people who have given you this
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
information have given you to given you
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
what they honestly believe is true but
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
it sounds like
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know we're not maybe they're not
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
exactly on the same page and i hope that
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
will sort of
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know in your work sessions or in
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up will ask them to kind of
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
get those numbers together so to speak
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
so that you have a you have an accurate
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
picture of whether things really are
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
taking longer
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
under the new system
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
than under the old system um i i have
 
01:52:59.830 --> 01:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
some i have some real question about
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
that but you know i don't i i'm not in
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
the court system anymore and i don't and
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
i don't really know but i hope that you
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
will find out because it seems to me
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
that that's as as i think
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
representatives who people who have
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
testified here both in support of and in
 
01:53:14.239 --> 01:53:15.510 align:start position:0%
testified here both in support of and in
opposition

01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:16.310 align:start position:0%
opposition
to

01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
the proposed bill have said
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's really important i think for the
 
01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:20.790 align:start position:0%
it's really important i think for the
committee

01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
to rely not on sort of anecdotal
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
you know things are taking longer or
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
things are being more efficient but
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
really looking at the numbers of what
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
what those what those numbers show
 
01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:33.750 align:start position:0%
what those what those numbers show
um

01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
the the other thing that i would that so
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
i hope that you will do that
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
it i must say that it sounds to me like
 
01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:42.470 align:start position:0%
it i must say that it sounds to me like
from

01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
what we've heard from both
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
people who have testified in favor of
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
this and and in opposition is that
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
one thing that i hope the committee will
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
at least consider as a possible
 
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
way of
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
of of
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
resolving this
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
is per you know to the extent that the
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
claim has been that
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
because there's no sort of automatic
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
right to a probable cause hearing
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
under the news under the felonies first
 
01:54:13.599 --> 01:54:14.550 align:start position:0%
under the news under the felonies first
system

01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
the lack of that
 
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
sort of stick you know that there's
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a probable cause
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on this date as as i think
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
everybody has sort of agreed
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that like under the
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
old system 87 or 85 to 87 percent of
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
those probable cause hearings never
 
01:54:33.189 --> 01:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
occurred they the the because either the
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
case was resolved or the purpose of
 
01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
of the defendant in requesting the
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
probable cause hearing
 
01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
um was to get was to get um
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh discovery and once discovery was got
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
there once discovery was had they they
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
sort of waved the probable cause hearing
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the extent that that
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
is not happening under the current
 
01:54:54.159 --> 01:54:55.350 align:start position:0%
is not happening under the current
system

01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:56.229 align:start position:0%
system
um

01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know maybe maybe that is a maybe
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
that would be a way of
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
helping to to move things along so to
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
speak in the superior court but in other
 
01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:07.750 align:start position:0%
speak in the superior court but in other
words

01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
change the change the requirement to
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
make the probable cause hearing sort of
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
automatic unless it's waived in the
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
superior court now
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
as i say that i'm sure richard head is
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
sitting behind me saying wait a minute
 
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to involve a tremendous
 
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
amount of work and i know that that that
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
that would include that would
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
potentially at least increase the work
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the superior court and
 
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
obviously if that were to happen you
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
know there's going to be a there's a
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
resource issue there that would
 
01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:35.990 align:start position:0%
resource issue there that would
um

01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
would arise but perhaps there's some way
 
01:55:42.070 --> 01:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
to work out language that would
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know would condition
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
the sort of automatic right to a
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
probable cause hearing in the superior
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
court on
 
01:55:50.239 --> 01:55:51.510 align:start position:0%
court on
um

01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
the defendant you know certifying that
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
he has not yet that he is by some time
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
frame that he has not received all
 
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
discovery that he's entitled to or
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
whatever and and if that's usually the
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
reason that that the you know the
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
probable cause hearing is sort of
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
insisted upon is kind of as as as a
 
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
stick by the defense to make sure they
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
get discovery maybe there could be some
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
language that would that would uh
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
would would condition the right on on
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
the defendant say certifying that he has
 
01:56:21.599 --> 01:56:22.709 align:start position:0%
the defendant say certifying that he has
not

01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
received uh complete discovery or or
 
01:56:26.950 --> 01:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
the last point i would make and i think
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is really
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
a really very important point is this
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
it then i hope the committee will
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
consider is this
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
the right time even if
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
a change back to the old system
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
is the right thing to do
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
is this the time to do it and i say that
 
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
i think you've sort of heard this from
 
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
from mr head and really others this
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
whole covert thing has had a huge impact
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
on the trial courts both the superior
 
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
court and the and the uh and the circuit
 
01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:04.149 align:start position:0%
court and the and the uh and the circuit
court

01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:57:04.159 --> 01:57:05.990 align:start position:0%
court
and

01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
to make a change now
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
to you know to sort of say we're going
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
to put
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
to go back to the old system is going to
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
involve a huge undertaking of work i
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
mean in in terms of what the court
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
system is going to have to go through
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's yes yes they're for you know they
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
know how it how it worked before
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
and they can make the changes to to to
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
return it to what to what it was but
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
that involves a lot of work
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
and it involves it will involve a lot of
 
01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:36.390 align:start position:0%
and it involves it will involve a lot of
work

01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
at a time when the court system
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
is really struggling so i hope you'll
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things you will ask
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
yourself is
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
is this the right time to do this even
 
01:57:46.639 --> 01:57:47.510 align:start position:0%
is this the right time to do this even
if

01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's something that you know eventually
 
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
should be done um
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
i i hope you'll you'll consider that uh
 
01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's really all i have to say
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for giving me the
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to appear i'm happy to
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if anyone has any
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
questions for representative lynn now we
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
have a yes representative dilorenzo
 
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr claire um representative
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
lynn i read in the newspaper that a lot
 
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
of jurisdictions have um
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
suspended jury trials temporarily
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
do you have any data on that so we could
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
get a sense of
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know what the difference is
 
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
between before code and and like well i
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
think while we're included thank you i i
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
i can't really give you statistics i
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
mean but i my understanding is that many
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
many courts
 
01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719 align:start position:0%
around the country at least for periods
 
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
of time
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
um did suspend
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know jury trials in fact maybe even
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
more and maybe even you know
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
many other court proceedings except
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
probably emergency things
 
01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:45.750 align:start position:0%
probably emergency things
of

01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
things like that but um so i think that
 
01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's true my understanding is that the
 
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire also the superior
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
court suspended jury trials for a period
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
of time i don't i don't have the exact
 
01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
dates but i know that that that that did
 
01:58:57.920 --> 01:58:58.790 align:start position:0%
dates but i know that that that that did
happen

01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:58:58.800 --> 01:58:59.750 align:start position:0%
happen
um

01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i say and i think that's you know
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire wasn't unique in that
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
regard at all but i in terms of how long
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh i i just haven't kind of kept up on
 
01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
that on that information but um but
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps mr head could give you that or
 
01:59:15.189 --> 01:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we you know that could be
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee if you if you
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
see you none thank you very much thank
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
my name is len harden i'm a
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%

entire career i've been up north for 29
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
years which is
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
surprising when i did the math just now
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
to realize how long i've been doing this
 
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
i'm here on behalf of myself as a solo
 
01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:55.510 align:start position:0%
i'm here on behalf of myself as a solo
practitioner

01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
01:59:58.950 --> 01:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
i do exclusively criminal defense i also
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
hear i've been on the board for the new
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire association of criminal
 
02:00:03.589 --> 02:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers for
 
02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
i didn't do the math for over 10 years
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
and we also are in support of this bill
 
02:00:12.390 --> 02:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
which is um in and i would i'm not gonna
 
02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:14.149 align:start position:0%
which is um in and i would i'm not gonna
re

02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
re
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
recount any of the issues that some of
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
my colleagues who i have great respect
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
for have already gone over
 
02:00:19.199 --> 02:00:19.990 align:start position:0%
for have already gone over
um

02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
but i i guess
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons and i certainly
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
support what they say and i would agree
 
02:00:26.709 --> 02:00:26.719 align:start position:0%
with attorney moyer that in my personal
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
experience i believe at least half of my
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
cases have resolved
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
in district court that were brought as
 
02:00:32.159 --> 02:00:33.510 align:start position:0%
in district court that were brought as
felonies

02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
felonies
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
i did want to share a couple of very
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
short anecdotal cases
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
that i think are helpful to understand
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
what type of cases we're talking about
 
02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
so i had a
 
02:00:43.599 --> 02:00:44.390 align:start position:0%
so i had a
um

02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
a case in in haverhill in grafton county
 
02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
where um a woman who had been a candidly
 
02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
a victim of domestic abuse for a long
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
long time
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
picked up a board
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
and and defended herself when she was
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
being attacked and she used a weapon and
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
she caused an injury so she was in
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
under the felony's first regime she was
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
charged with a felony for causing bodily
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
injury to that
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
honestly the violent person
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
and it took an inordinate
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
amount of time and it took a lot of work
 
02:01:20.229 --> 02:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
because the local police knew that the
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
boyfriend was a bad man
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
and they knew his history
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
but again the the way that that gets
 
02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
communicated to the county attorney i
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
believe is through an email through an
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
indirect channel and the lack of local
 
02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:35.669 align:start position:0%
indirect channel and the lack of local
hands-on

02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
hands-on
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
boots on the ground kind of information
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
is really what caused that to be a great
 
02:01:42.070 --> 02:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
delay another case that i see typically
 
02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:42.950 align:start position:0%
delay another case that i see typically
is

02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
possession of drugs which we we all
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
recognize as a scourge but again the in
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
the cases that i have seen
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
over and over again these types of cases
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
where somebody gets stopped for a
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
typical motor vehicle violation one case
 
02:01:58.070 --> 02:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
that i'm thinking of in particular
 
02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
a gentleman had a pill crusher which
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
essentially is has residue of a pill and
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
it allows somebody to snort the pill
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of the thing is um so
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
he gets charged with a felony and it
 
02:02:12.149 --> 02:02:12.159 align:start position:0%
goes up to the district court and they
 
02:02:12.159 --> 02:02:13.589 align:start position:0%
goes up to the district court and they
and

02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:13.599 --> 02:02:14.229 align:start position:0%
and
er

02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
er
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
in days gone by that case would go to
 
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
the district court we would meet with
 
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor the prosecutor would be
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
either a police prosecutor or a lawyer
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
they would get permission from the
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
county attorneys to resolve the case and
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
we would resolve that case almost
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
uniformly that case would get resolved
 
02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
now that case goes up to the superior
 
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
court and it takes a lot longer for the
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
case to get hurt and to get a resolution
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
and ultimately it it still should be and
 
02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
it probably will always be a misdemeanor
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
for a first offense for that person and
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
but it takes longer and it takes more
 
02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:47.990 align:start position:0%
but it takes longer and it takes more
time

02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:02:50.070 --> 02:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
the the one thing that i wanted to bring
 
02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
up that i don't think has been touched
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
on a lot is the issue about recidivism
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
and why and how that
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
is going in my opinion would be better
 
02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
served by going back to the 2015 method
 
02:03:05.589 --> 02:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
so there are sorts all sorts of studies
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
and i'll leave that to you folks to to
 
02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
delve into about the quicker a person
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
gets into treatment
 
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
the more effective that treatment is and
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that's why another reason why it's
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
very important that we we look at the
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
timeline and how quickly these things
 
02:03:19.199 --> 02:03:20.070 align:start position:0%
timeline and how quickly these things
occur

02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
occur
 
02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
but by getting somebody
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
put onto probation mandated to go to
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
counseling mandated to get an alcohol
 
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
drug evaluation mandated to get on on
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
the road to recovery sooner has a bigger
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
impact it also psychologically helps
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
when somebody says oh my goodness i just
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
got charged with a crime i've never been
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
charged with a crime before and now i'm
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
in court and then all of a sudden two
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
weeks later i'm on probation they take
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
it very seriously if it takes a
 
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
prolonged period of time that same
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
person doesn't have the same impetus to
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
participate and they don't get the same
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
benefit out of
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
um out of the shock and the and the
 
02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:00.790 align:start position:0%
um out of the shock and the and the
scare

02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
scare
 
02:04:02.550 --> 02:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
quite candidly um
 
02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.069 align:start position:0%
quite candidly um
but

02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
felonies person and anecdotally again in
 
02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
my experience
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
has certainly slowed down the process it
 
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.189 align:start position:0%
has certainly slowed down the process it
it

02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
the lack of local control and lack of
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
input also i think has an impact on
 
02:04:19.119 --> 02:04:20.149 align:start position:0%
input also i think has an impact on
treatment

02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
and the impact that it has on the actual
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
defendants who were who were hopefully
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
going to turn into
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
and help
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
turn their lives around in a positive
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
the the other
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
thought that i would like to share with
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
the committee would be um
 
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
just just to echo what other folks have
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
said that when we when we try to solve a
 
02:04:43.679 --> 02:04:44.870 align:start position:0%
said that when we when we try to solve a
problem

02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:46.310 align:start position:0%
problem
um

02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
and you're looking at it either
 
02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
either it is or it isn't it seems like
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is the the classic if you're a
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
hammer and you ask someone how to fasten
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
a board together you look for a nail and
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
you don't look for the screw um and in
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
in this case i think
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
the felonies first
 
02:05:02.079 --> 02:05:03.910 align:start position:0%
the felonies first
um

02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
is looking for a solution that like
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
attorney moyer said wasn't a problem the
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
there are going to be 2 000 cases or
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
whatever the number of cases are
 
02:05:16.149 --> 02:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
either in the district court or in the
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
superior court and certainly i would
 
02:05:20.069 --> 02:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
echo everybody's sentiment that the
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
district court's much more nimble and
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
more capable and i would say in my
 
02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:26.069 align:start position:0%
more capable and i would say in my
experience

02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
that the district court has much more
 
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:31.350 align:start position:0%
common sense
appeal

02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
from the judges from the local police
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and not not disparaging my
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
county attorney friends i think that
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
they've also worked in the district
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
court but they see the pragmatic
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
solutions that people can come up with
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
which are very unique and i think very
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
special to new hampshire so for all
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
those reasons i certainly support this
 
02:05:48.639 --> 02:05:49.830 align:start position:0%
those reasons i certainly support this
bill

02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
and the organization that i support
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
great any questions for attorney hardin

seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
you simone
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee uh
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
good morning still um my name is frank
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
knack i'm the policy director with the
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
aclu of new hampshire
 
02:06:20.079 --> 02:06:21.510 align:start position:0%
aclu of new hampshire
um

02:06:21.510 --> 02:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
we are we are here in support of this
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh we thank uh the chairman for
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill and also you know
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
support everything and all the data that
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
mr hawks outlined and so i don't want to
 
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
repeat what's already been said i do
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
want to build upon a few a few notes
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
that have been mentioned i think it was
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
the merrimack county attorney who
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
looking at you know the causes of
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
backlog and was it an increase in crimes
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
and i think it was he had testified that
 
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
he had not seen an increase of crimes in
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
his county and so i actually pulled the
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh state data for crimes and arrests
 
02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
from 2017 through 2020 and what you
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
actually see is a steady decline in
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
crimes group a crimes so between 2017
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
and 2019 which is pre-coveted the three
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
pre-covered years you saw an 11 decline
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
in crimes committed this is group a
 
02:07:10.639 --> 02:07:11.589 align:start position:0%
in crimes committed this is group a
crimes

02:07:11.589 --> 02:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
02:07:14.069 --> 02:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
and then a 10 decrease in arrests and so
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
any notion that there was an increase of
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
arrest or increase of crimes as a cause
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the backlog i think wouldn't be
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
supported and if you fast forward to
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
2020 which i think is somewhat skewed
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
because of covid you're down to a 22
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
decline in crime rates
 
02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
for those for that period
 
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
in addition i think there's been a lot
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
of talk about efficiency and you know
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
i think one of the one of the county
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys testified that you know the
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
process there would be a lot of time in
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
retraining and creating new processes
 
02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
and going back to the old system and i
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
think you know what what our concern is
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
obviously we like this bill because it
 
02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
would bring back some due process
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
protections ensuring that people get a
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
pc hearing
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with the backlog that's
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
impacting people's lives on a daily
 
02:07:57.750 --> 02:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
basis and their families and their
 
02:07:57.760 --> 02:07:59.270 align:start position:0%
basis and their families and their
communities

02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
but also if if we're serious about
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
actually understanding you know the the
 
02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
root causes of why we have backlogs we
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
should look at and i think there are a
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
number of bills before this legislative
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
body this session that actually address
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
the causes of why we have backlogs you
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
know defelonizing all drug possession
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
there is legislation before this body
 
02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
that would do that that would reduce
 
02:08:21.430 --> 02:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
crime we should look at data-driven ways
 
02:08:22.629 --> 02:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
to reduce
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
the burden on our courts and i think
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's many opportunities before this
 
02:08:27.910 --> 02:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
legislative body this session to do so
 
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%

tried a lot of cases a lot of places
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
but i've been hearing about this bill
 
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
and i was quite interested in it and
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
i've been listening to the testimony
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
about the good old days and uh and
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
what's going on right now
 
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
the first time i stood up
 
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
for an accused citizen in the state of
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was in portsmouth district
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
court when it was located
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
not where it is now but in a police
 
02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:54.550 align:start position:0%
not where it is now but in a police
station

02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
station
 
02:09:56.550 --> 02:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure anybody familiar with what
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
the area would know it was a pretty
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
interesting place
 
02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
it hearkened back to you know the 1800s
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
it was a probable cause hearing
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
and it was for an individual that i can
 
02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
i can remember your first one you never
 
02:10:11.119 --> 02:10:12.550 align:start position:0%
i can remember your first one you never
forget

02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
forget
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
and uh he was charged with eight
 
02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:17.189 align:start position:0%
and uh he was charged with eight
burglaries

02:10:17.189 --> 02:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
burglaries
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
and they were all felonies obviously
 
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
the probable cause hearing went on
 
02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
an hour and a half
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
probable cause was found
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
but during the course of the probable
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
cause hearing serious flaws with regard
 
02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
to this individual's confession were
 
02:10:34.239 --> 02:10:36.069 align:start position:0%
to this individual's confession were
exposed

02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
exposed
 
02:10:38.550 --> 02:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
because of that particular information
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
that was gained during the course of an
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
actual hearing
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
with actual witnesses in an actual
 
02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:45.990 align:start position:0%
with actual witnesses in an actual
courtroom

02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
courtroom
 
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
the case was later dropped
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
and the felonies were resolved
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
now that's not
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's not an uncommon situation
 
02:10:58.950 --> 02:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
the importance of a probable cause
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
hearing and the importance of the way
 
02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
the structure was
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
prior to the felony's first
 
02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:07.270 align:start position:0%
prior to the felony's first
introduction

02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
was that it gave
 
02:11:12.229 --> 02:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities for lawyers
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
and prosecutors to find out what the
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
case is about
 
02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
now whether or not whether or not no
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
probable cause was found is an issue
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not the individual
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
should be treated with regard to a
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
lesser offense could be addressed
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not bail could be addressed
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
all of these issues are very very
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
important they're more important than
 
02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
dollar signs and quite frankly they're
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
more important than ringing our hands
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
and saying we have to go back to the old
 
02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:44.550 align:start position:0%
and saying we have to go back to the old
days

02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
the old days weren't bad
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
the old days survived for decades and
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
decades and decades
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the prosecutors in this state
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the criminal defense bar in
 
02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
this state that came to you on their
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
knees begging for a change
 
02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
we were working well within that system
 
02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
and the examples go on and on
 
02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
if you if you bring criminal defense
 
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys and prosecutors into this room
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
and ask them about how resolution took
 
02:12:16.079 --> 02:12:17.189 align:start position:0%
and ask them about how resolution took
place

02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
prior to this new institution that we're
 
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with they will tell you story
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
after story now that's not a statistic
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
but it's a reality
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
these are individuals that work every
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
day in the system
 
02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
and it happened time after time after
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
time where resolutions were found
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
not just in burglary cases
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
but i mean i can go through a long list
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
i have practiced law in every district
 
02:12:47.669 --> 02:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
court in this state
 
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
i have tried jury trials in every
 
02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
superior court in this state
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
that the old system worked
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
it even worked
 
02:13:00.069 --> 02:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
with murder cases
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
probable cause hearings on murder cases
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
could expose problems with murder cases
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
where an attorney general's office would
 
02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
look at flaws during that particular
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
proceeding and make a charging decision
 
02:13:18.149 --> 02:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
different than the original charging
 
02:13:18.159 --> 02:13:19.430 align:start position:0%
different than the original charging
decision

02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
which would resolve the case quickly and
 
02:13:22.639 --> 02:13:24.390 align:start position:0%
which would resolve the case quickly and
efficiently

02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
without rendering this
 
02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:27.750 align:start position:0%
without rendering this
lag

02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
lag
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
that takes place at superior court right
 
02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:31.350 align:start position:0%
that takes place at superior court right
now

02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough
 
02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
i was i was focused on the testimony of
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
the county attorney from belknap county
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
a friend of mine
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
and an individual that i work with all
 
02:13:47.669 --> 02:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:47.679 --> 02:13:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
i completed a uh
 
02:13:51.199 --> 02:13:52.069 align:start position:0%
i completed a uh
com

02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
com
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
fairly complex aggravated felonious
 
02:13:56.830 --> 02:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
sexual assault in belknap county
 
02:13:59.910 --> 02:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
recently and i can tell you something
 
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
that this felony's first business
 
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
delayed that case over
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
and over
 
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
and over again during the course of the
 
02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:08.870 align:start position:0%
and over again during the course of the
trial

02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
trial
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
what would have or should have taken
 
02:14:14.069 --> 02:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
three days was in belknap county as we
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
call it belknap county time
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
when we are asked when we are asked to
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
estimate the length
 
02:14:23.109 --> 02:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
of trial in belknap county the judge
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
asks us that question
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
and we say generally we say the reality
 
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
time would be about three days
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
but belknap county time is about seven
 
02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:34.149 align:start position:0%
but belknap county time is about seven
days

02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
and why is it seven days
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
because it's a one judge court
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's a one judge court and they don't
 
02:14:42.550 --> 02:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
know what their dock is going to be from
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
day to day
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
they have no idea
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
who got picked up the night before
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
and when they when they come into the
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
courthouse in the morning they take a
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
look and they say uh oh we got felonies
 
02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:55.430 align:start position:0%
look and they say uh oh we got felonies
first

02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
we got one felony first
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
or we have five felonies first well you
 
02:15:02.709 --> 02:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
also have a jury sitting there
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
that has to be there too
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
so what are they doing in the afternoon
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
while you're going through felonies
 
02:15:08.079 --> 02:15:09.750 align:start position:0%
while you're going through felonies
first

02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing nothing
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
and how is the case proceeding that you
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
started trying in the morning
 
02:15:17.109 --> 02:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
so if you want to talk about
 
02:15:18.159 --> 02:15:19.830 align:start position:0%
so if you want to talk about
efficiencies

02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
efficiencies
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
and you want to talk about
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
ways of getting things moving quicker
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
it's the old way
 
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's not that hard to go back to it
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
and any practitioner that's been
 
02:15:33.199 --> 02:15:35.270 align:start position:0%
and any practitioner that's been
practicing

02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
practicing
 
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the years with the old system
 
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
and the new system will tell you that
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
more lawyering and more negotiation took
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
place in the district courts

police departments can call county
 
02:16:00.079 --> 02:16:01.189 align:start position:0%
police departments can call county
attorneys

02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
02:16:03.189 --> 02:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
if there's a serious offense that takes
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
place tonight
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
in belknap county or coast county or
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
down in nashua
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
the police department can call a county
 
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
attorney out they can inform them what's
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
going on
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
they can kick in the services that they
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
have to kick in at that particular spot
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
and they can start resolution
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
but what's going on now
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
and i think attorney halverson nailed it
 
02:16:31.109 --> 02:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
it's a it's just a choke point
 
02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
we're all getting choked
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
and i hear it from everybody
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
i supervised 72 lawyers at the public
 
02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
defenders randy hawks has twice as many
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
and i will tell you
 
02:16:47.509 --> 02:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
i know what the numbers are at the
 
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
public defenders now i know because my
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
daughter worked there for 15 years and
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
my son-in-law still does
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
and you are suffocating people in that
 
02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.190 align:start position:0%
and you are suffocating people in that
system

02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
and and it's because and i'm going to
 
02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
say this it's the direct result
 
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
of this change
 
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
it has slowed the process and it is
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
grinding people up
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to urge you i'm going to
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
ask you i almost beg you
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
that you when you consider this
 
02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
that you take a hard look at what it's
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
doing to the entire process across the
 
02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:22.070 align:start position:0%
doing to the entire process across the
board

02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
people were happier in the system
 
02:17:27.270 --> 02:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
defendants were given more protection in
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
and it ran smoothly
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
prior to the introduction of felonies
 
02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:34.230 align:start position:0%
prior to the introduction of felonies
first

02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh obviously you know i support the bill
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
i'll take questions representative
 
02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.030 align:start position:0%
i'll take questions representative
horrigan

02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
horrigan
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
you mentioned belknap county time and i
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
apologize i missed
 
02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
i was
 
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
introducing a bill on another committee
 
02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
so i apologize for missing your
 
02:17:52.469 --> 02:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
at least part of your testimony
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
with belknap county which has a one
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
judge court do they bring in an
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
additional judge for uh
 
02:17:59.830 --> 02:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
belnov county several times a year has
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know mass gatherings they have the
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
bike week
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
well most years and they have also the
 
02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:07.349 align:start position:0%
well most years and they have also the
concert

02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
concert
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
venue in guilford and i assume a large
 
02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
number of people get picked up for minor
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors for misbehaving while
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
they're enjoying the concert so did they
 
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
bring in extra
 
02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
judges on occasions like that or is it
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
even more gridlocked on after those
 
02:18:22.629 --> 02:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
events than it would be normally well i
 
02:18:22.639 --> 02:18:23.830 align:start position:0%
events than it would be normally well i
mean

02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
andrew can speak to that as well but uh
 
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's not really a regular
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
occurrence judges are brought in
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh on occasion um it's it's not
 
02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
something that is uh actually even
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled where we would know when we're
 
02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
having to judge
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
a courthouse but
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
the timing you know just because you
 
02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
have a concert on one night doesn't mean
 
02:18:45.910 --> 02:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
that your cases are going to load the
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
next day
 
02:18:47.519 --> 02:18:48.309 align:start position:0%
next day
but

02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
the interesting thing is it's a great
 
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
point that if you have a concert and you
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
have a mass arrest on one night and
 
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're brought to a
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
courthouse a circuit court
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
the next day yes what would happen
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
in the new system
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
attorneys would be assigned
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
the process would begin and early
 
02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
resolution could take place that's not
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.509 --> 02:19:15.519 align:start position:0%

just focus on rockingham county for the
moment

02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
using the statistics
 
02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
that have already been referenced
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
roughly 25 percent of the cases under
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
the old system
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
filed in rockingham county were resolved
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
in the district courts what does that
 
02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:04.469 align:start position:0%
in the district courts what does that
mean

02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
so for
 
02:20:08.469 --> 02:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
every 75 cases that the county
 
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
attorney's office used to have they now
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
have 100 cases
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
what does that mean for the superior
 
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
court well
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
to process
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
a case in superior court there are
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
usually two or three people in the
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
clerk's office who touch the file
 
02:20:26.670 --> 02:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
there are then two or three
 
02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:28.389 align:start position:0%
there are then two or three
administrators

02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
support staff in the county attorney's
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
office who touches the file
 
02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
there's the reviewing
 
02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer who assigns the case in the
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
the assigned lawyer in the county
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
attorney's office
 
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
and the supervising lawyer in the county
 
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
attorney's office
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then these felonies even if they are
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
at some point reduced to misdemeanors
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
these felonies get presented to the
 
02:20:59.110 --> 02:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
grand jury because there's a right to
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
indictment within 90 days
 
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
the grand jury is 23 people
 
02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:07.270 align:start position:0%
the grand jury is 23 people
and

02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:09.190 --> 02:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
then there are the judges who were
 
02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
assigned to initial hearings and then
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
dispositional hearings and status
 
02:21:13.920 --> 02:21:15.110 align:start position:0%
dispositional hearings and status
conferences

02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
conferences
 
02:21:17.830 --> 02:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
in many of my cases it's two judges
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
which means
 
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
also two deputy clerks who are touching
 
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
a case
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
so what that means is that if you're
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
bringing a felony case
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
there are between 30 and 40 people who
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:37.429 align:start position:0%
 
alternately

02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
alternately
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
if a case was resolved in the district
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
court while there are people from the
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
clerk's office and the police prosecutor
 
02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:46.950 align:start position:0%
clerk's office and the police prosecutor
involved

02:21:46.950 --> 02:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
involved
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers are dramatically different
 
02:21:53.349 --> 02:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the impact on the local
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
police department to indict typically
 
02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
there is one or two police officers
 
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
who are going to the grand jury to
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
present testimony to them
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
so as a management system
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
you are creating a process
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
of 30 to 40 people touching the file
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
that eventually is resolved in 25 of the
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
cases as a misdemeanor
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
as a management construct
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make sense
 
02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:28.870 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make sense
in

02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
full disclosure
 
02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:32.070 align:start position:0%
full disclosure
i

02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
representing new hampshire association
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
of criminal defense lawyers
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
testified against felonies first
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
our prediction was it would not work
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
it would create
 
02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
enormous greater case loads for county
 
02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:48.230 align:start position:0%
enormous greater case loads for county
attorneys

02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
it would result in a slower average time
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
for resolution of cases
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
and that information is accurate and
 
02:22:56.399 --> 02:22:57.990 align:start position:0%
and that information is accurate and
true

02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%

the information that he presented to you
 
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
today is exactly the information that we

today is exactly the information that we
disputed

02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
disputed
 
02:23:09.359 --> 02:23:10.070 align:start position:0%
disputed
when

02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
felonies first was proposed
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
the information that
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
randy hawks is presented to you is from
 
02:23:22.710 --> 02:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
statistics analyzing case by case

02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
we could never get the information the
 
02:23:29.349 --> 02:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
underlying information as to how the
 
02:23:29.359 --> 02:23:30.710 align:start position:0%
underlying information as to how the
court

02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
came up with this 323 days it might have
 
02:23:36.550 --> 02:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
been based on
 
02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:37.670 align:start position:0%
been based on
limited

02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
limited
 
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
cases that were resolved as felonies
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
that then necessarily deleted the
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors resolved in the district
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
court that had been originally charged
 
02:23:50.309 --> 02:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
as felonies
 
02:23:52.389 --> 02:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
well i don't always agree with judge
 
02:23:55.270 --> 02:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
lynn i sure agree with him now find out
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
where this information is coming from
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
test the statistics i want to go back to
 
02:24:03.429 --> 02:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
just a couple points quickly that have
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
been made
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of victim services it is
 
02:24:08.230 --> 02:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely true that every county
 
02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
attorney's office has
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
assistance for victims
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
it is also the case in many many police
 
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
departments and in virtually every
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
district court there are victim witness
 
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
advocates there too
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
there was conversation by attorney head
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
about the possibility of cases being
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
pled down and
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
returned to the district court i can
 
02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
just tell you in rockingham county that
 
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
just does not happen
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
my cases which used to take four to six
 
02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
months to resolve i will tell you cases
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
that are now being addressed as
 
02:24:46.469 --> 02:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors in the end are taking nine
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
months to a year
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
part of what's going on
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
is that we have
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
requested of the county attorney's
 
02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
office that they deal with the serious
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
as well as the minor
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
and in dealing with the minor they are
 
02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
less attentive to the serious ones as
 
02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
less attentive to the serious ones as
well

02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
i i did a 10-day jury trial
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
where it was a serious case involved a
 
02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:11.510 align:start position:0%
where it was a serious case involved a
gun

02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
gun
 
02:25:14.230 --> 02:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor had to be involved in
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with other minor misdemeanors as
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
we were doing the trial
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
as a citizen i would prefer the county
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
attorney's office to
 
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
focus on the serious
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
and let the misdemean the lesser cases
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
that can be addressed as misdemeanor let
 
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
them be resolved
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
in the district court so the county
 
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
attorney's office the best trained as
 
02:25:37.030 --> 02:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
attorney liver noise said the best
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
trained the most experienced
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
are focusing on the
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
cases that create harm to our community
 
02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
a point that i think attorney liver
 
02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
noise misses
 
02:25:47.359 --> 02:25:48.230 align:start position:0%
noise misses
is

02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:49.270 align:start position:0%
is
that

02:25:49.270 --> 02:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
under the old system there was always
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
concurrent jurisdiction
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
between the district court and the
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
superior court for felonies
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
so to the point he was concerned about
 
02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:03.110 align:start position:0%
so to the point he was concerned about
his

02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
experienced prosecutors couldn't get a
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
case quickly
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
it is the case under the old law and it
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
should be the case if there are changes
 
02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:12.950 align:start position:0%
should be the case if there are changes
now

02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
that a case can be felt uh filed in
 
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
either court
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
so if he has a concern that he wants a
 
02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:20.870 align:start position:0%
so if he has a concern that he wants a
case

02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
a sexual assault a serious weapons
 
02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:24.469 align:start position:0%
a sexual assault a serious weapons
charge

02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
charge
 
02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
he can talk with the police department
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
instantly and say
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
let's file it in the superior court not
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
the district court
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
so that concern can be fully addressed
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
there's been some
 
02:26:42.389 --> 02:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
conversation about the impact of delayed
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
treatment it is the case that with the
 
02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:45.830 align:start position:0%
treatment it is the case that with the
delay

02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
delay
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
in resolution of cases whether it's
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol or drugs or mental health we're
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
not letting or getting people into
 
02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
treatment now
 
02:26:58.150 --> 02:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
we're doing it months later sometimes
 
02:26:58.160 --> 02:26:59.110 align:start position:0%
we're doing it months later sometimes
when

02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
other greater difficulties
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
have occurred
 
02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
the court system said
 
02:27:07.590 --> 02:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:27:10.710 --> 02:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
that police departments would be trained
 
02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
to file the lesser cases not as felonies
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
but as misdemeanors and that simply has
 
02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
not occurred and isn't the way the
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
charging decisions are made
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
when somebody's picked up at midnight
 
02:27:27.270 --> 02:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
by a police officer with two or three
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
years experience that officer is not
 
02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
going to choose to charge
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
a felony drug case small as it may be as
 
02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
that will be charged as a felony and
 
02:27:41.590 --> 02:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
away we go to the superior court
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
so the idea that there will be
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
differing judgments in the charging
 
02:27:46.399 --> 02:27:47.910 align:start position:0%
differing judgments in the charging
process

02:27:47.910 --> 02:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
is not
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
the case in the real world
 
02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
it is my hope
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
that you will take
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
this bill seriously it would be an
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
important improvement in the court
 
02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:01.510 align:start position:0%
important improvement in the court
system

02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
providing prompter justice in a fairer
 
02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:06.230 align:start position:0%
providing prompter justice in a fairer
way

02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:28:09.030 --> 02:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and do we have any
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
questions or we do from representative
 
02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:13.590 align:start position:0%
questions or we do from representative
chase

02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
chase
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
question so what is actually stopping
 
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
the police from
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
filing a misdemeanor are you just saying
 
02:28:24.630 --> 02:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
that it's the younger
 
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
rookie cops that are doing this well
 
02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
in truth the decisions should be made to
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
my view knowing more about the defendant
 
02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
than you know at the time of the arrest
 
02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:36.469 align:start position:0%
than you know at the time of the arrest
so

02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
it could be a drug case really should be
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
a felony or maybe it should be a
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor at midnight we don't know
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
what that individual's prior record is
 
02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether it's a drug
 
02:28:51.910 --> 02:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
dealing case or a drug possession case
 
02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
so i think it's completely appropriate
 
02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
to charge those cases as felonies it's
 
02:29:00.309 --> 02:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
just once that's done
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
away we go to superior court and so when
 
02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:05.349 align:start position:0%
away we go to superior court and so when
the

02:29:05.349 --> 02:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
court administration
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
was supporting this bill years ago they
 
02:29:13.030 --> 02:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
were making the claim which i think is
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
not a claim in the real world
 
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
that these
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
felonies would simply be charged as
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors that's not the way i think
 
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
real decision making
 
02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
gets done
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
because you would want to know something
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
about the case and you would want to
 
02:29:30.150 --> 02:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
know something about the defendant
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
further questions for the attorney
 
02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:41.510 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
testimony

02:29:43.110 --> 02:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else in the room who
 
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on house bill
 
02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:48.870 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on house bill
1597

02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%

seeing none that i will call this
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
hearing the house bill 1597 to a close
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
and we are running about a half hour
 
02:29:57.600 --> 02:29:58.710 align:start position:0%
and we are running about a half hour
behind

02:29:58.710 --> 02:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
behind
 
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
so we'll
 
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
press right on
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%

you were offended that court system was
 
02:30:53.349 --> 02:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
affected in this
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%

02:32:38.800 --> 02:33:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
we'll call the house judiciary committee
 
02:33:20.230 --> 02:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
back to order
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
our next item of business this morning
 
02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
is a hearing on house bill 1014 allowing
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
public meetings to be conducted
 
02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:28.710 align:start position:0%
public meetings to be conducted
virtually

02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
virtually
 
02:33:31.190 --> 02:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
the primary sponsor of that bill is
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative simpson
 
02:33:35.429 --> 02:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
and we'll call upon her to introduce the
 
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:41.190 --> 02:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you committee members for
 
02:33:44.790 --> 02:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
hearing me introduce this bill this

hearing me introduce this bill this
morning

02:33:48.790 --> 02:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
the circumstances of the pandemic and
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
the emergency order regarding public
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
meetings allowed us to see what might be
 
02:33:57.190 --> 02:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
possible for the effective functioning
 
02:33:59.349 --> 02:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
of democracy with the use of technology
 
02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
for meetings
 
02:34:02.710 --> 02:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the emergency order we saw
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
overwhelming support by the public for
 
02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
remote access to public meetings
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
i've also heard from many town officials
 
02:34:11.830 --> 02:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
that they found the use of remote
 
02:34:14.070 --> 02:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
meetings allowed for broader stakeholder
 
02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
participation which makes their work
 
02:34:17.990 --> 02:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
more effective
 
02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
and i realize now i forgot to say that i
 
02:34:22.469 --> 02:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of exeter new market
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
new fields and stratum
 
02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
i reside in exeter
 
02:34:28.469 --> 02:34:28.479 align:start position:0%
and my name is alexis simpson for the
 
02:34:28.479 --> 02:34:30.630 align:start position:0%
and my name is alexis simpson for the
record

02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
record
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
i know last year when we discussed
 
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
remote meetings in the committee there
 
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
were some concerns
 
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
in this bill i attempted to correct for
 
02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
the concerns raised this is a narrow
 
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
narrower bill than previous remote
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
meetings bills
 
02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
it simply allows towns municipalities
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
and public state bodies
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
to choose to meet virtually or offer a
 
02:34:56.150 --> 02:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
remote option to its members
 
02:34:58.710 --> 02:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
the bill allows this by adding rules
 
02:35:01.190 --> 02:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
that must be met by the public body
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
under the right to know laws in rsa 91a
 
02:35:09.270 --> 02:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
hb 1014 provides direction for public
 
02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:10.309 align:start position:0%
hb 1014 provides direction for public
notice

02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
notice
 
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
and public access both to virtual
 
02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:13.990 align:start position:0%
and public access both to virtual
meetings

02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
and to meetings with an option for
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
remote attendance under the right to
 
02:35:18.950 --> 02:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
know law
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
the bill makes it clear that if there is
 
02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
a physical meeting location there does
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
not have to be a remote option
 
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
it gives the authority to decide whether
 
02:35:29.670 --> 02:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
a meeting will be remote
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
to the public body
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
not to an individual member of the body
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
which just as a side note the house has
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
decided in its rules
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
not to take this option
 
02:35:44.230 --> 02:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would give other bodies in the
 
02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
state the option to take it if they
 
02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:48.950 align:start position:0%
state the option to take it if they
desired

02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
desired
 
02:35:51.270 --> 02:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
this bill also addresses online chat
 
02:35:53.830 --> 02:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
functions that we've spoken about before
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
by treating them the same way that rsa
 
02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
91a treats email correspondence
 
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
access to remote state and local
 
02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
meetings during the pandemic was
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
necessary for granite staters to stay
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
safe but it continues to be necessary
 
02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
for those who experience barriers to
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
accessing in-person meetings
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
under regular non-pandemic conditions
 
02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
those who have disabilities those who
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
have young children elderly citizens and
 
02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
those who can't drive at night or in the
 
02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
snow have all shared with me how
 
02:36:30.790 --> 02:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
important remote access is to them
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
these are just some of the people who
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
are able to participate more fully in
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
without adapting language in rsa 91a the
 
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
statute regarding the right to know laws
 
02:36:48.110 --> 02:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
government bodies at the town
 
02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities and state level are no
 
02:36:53.349 --> 02:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
longer able to choose a remote meeting
 
02:36:53.359 --> 02:36:54.389 align:start position:0%
longer able to choose a remote meeting
option

02:36:54.389 --> 02:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
option
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
and the public is no longer able to
 
02:36:58.630 --> 02:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
participate in meetings remotely
 
02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
this bill would give government bodies
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
who wish the option
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
i hope you will hear testimony from
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
towns and from the nhma who supports
 
02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
this bill they will um
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
also talk a bit about towns they
 
02:37:16.710 --> 02:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
represent i hope
 
02:37:18.389 --> 02:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
that having this would make a difference
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
to their members in conducting business
 
02:37:25.030 --> 02:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'll take questions now
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative wolper did you have a
 
02:37:33.750 --> 02:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you mr chairman and
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
is there a required physical location
 
02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
for a meeting if you're holding it
 
02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:47.349 align:start position:0%
for a meeting if you're holding it
remotely

02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
not in this bill no
 
02:37:52.389 --> 02:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
there is an option for a fully virtual
 
02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:59.030 --> 02:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
so if you have
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
thought yep
 
02:38:01.990 --> 02:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
if you're having a
 
02:38:04.469 --> 02:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
remote meeting do you have to allow
 
02:38:07.990 --> 02:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
i believe that most of the bodies decide
 
02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:18.070 align:start position:0%
i believe that most of the bodies decide
um

02:38:18.070 --> 02:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
how and how to do public input
 
02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:22.309 align:start position:0%
how and how to do public input
um

02:38:22.309 --> 02:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
so i don't know that that's part of
 
02:38:28.469 --> 02:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
asrsa rsa 91a that would require public
 
02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
input at all bodies that meet i'm not
 
02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
sure that's part of
 
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
i don't i am unclear
 
02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
if the answer to your question is
 
02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
answered in 10 14.
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
you may follow yeah that'd be helpful
 
02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:46.550 align:start position:0%
you may follow yeah that'd be helpful
actually

02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
thank you if you can clarify one more
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the reason we
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
have public meetings
 
02:38:59.270 --> 02:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
is for the public to be able to
 
02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:00.550 align:start position:0%
is for the public to be able to
interface

02:39:00.550 --> 02:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
interface
 
02:39:02.070 --> 02:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
with their
 
02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
elected officials or whoever
 
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
if the meeting is totally remote
 
02:39:12.389 --> 02:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
isn't public input
 
02:39:12.399 --> 02:39:13.990 align:start position:0%
isn't public input
remotely

02:39:13.990 --> 02:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
a necessary part of that yes yes so my
 
02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that requirement is not
 
02:39:22.830 --> 02:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
changed by this piece of
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
legislation does that make sense so it's
 
02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
still required to have public input but
 
02:39:29.590 --> 02:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
if that's not
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative welber if that's not it's
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding that's built into the
 
02:39:37.030 --> 02:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
rsa that that public input is required
 
02:39:38.710 --> 02:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the meeting
 
02:39:42.309 --> 02:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
happens virtually or in person
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
if that's unclear
 
02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
then i'm
 
02:39:47.270 --> 02:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
open to adding an amendment that would
 
02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
make that clear
 
02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
that there would be the same requirement
 
02:39:54.710 --> 02:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
for public input
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
if the meeting is remote that there is
 
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
a parody do you know what i'm saying
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
that there be the same requirement for
 
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
public input
 
02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
at a remote meeting as there would be
 
02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
for an in-person meeting
 
02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
we'll come back okay okay representative
 
02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:18.630 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:19.510 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
91a is in support of uh our
 
02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:24.710 align:start position:0%
91a is in support of uh our
constitutional

02:40:24.710 --> 02:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
02:40:27.030 --> 02:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
constitution part first article 8 which
 
02:40:29.590 --> 02:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
demands transparency
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
if a meeting is totally remote
 
02:40:36.389 --> 02:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
how much transparency
 
02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:42.150 align:start position:0%
is there
if

02:40:42.150 --> 02:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:40:44.150 --> 02:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
02:40:47.590 --> 02:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
members of whatever that public body
 
02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:48.950 align:start position:0%
members of whatever that public body
is

02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:50.230 align:start position:0%
is
are

02:40:50.230 --> 02:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
texting to one another um outside of the
 
02:40:53.279 --> 02:40:54.469 align:start position:0%
texting to one another um outside of the
the

02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:40:56.469 --> 02:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
normal channel whatever channel it is
 
02:40:57.830 --> 02:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
phone interface
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
i have not thought about texting
 
02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:08.309 align:start position:0%
i have not thought about texting
um

02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't know how that would
 
02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:12.150 align:start position:0%
but i don't know how that would
differ

02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
differ
 
02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:13.349 align:start position:0%
differ
whether

02:41:13.349 --> 02:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:41:16.630 --> 02:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
a body is in person or whether they are
 
02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:19.190 align:start position:0%
a body is in person or whether they are
remote

02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
would you believe that if people were
 
02:41:25.349 --> 02:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
texting in this room i would
 
02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps have an idea in fact the the
 
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:35.269 --> 02:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
um i would i would not necessarily
 
02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
because i think it's not
 
02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:41.429 align:start position:0%
because i think it's not
clear

02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
clear
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
what a person is doing behind their
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
computer or behind their phone
 
02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
so in my estimation i think it'd be hard
 
02:41:51.429 --> 02:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:52.950 --> 02:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
or i'll speak for myself it would be
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
hard for me to know whether someone was
 
02:41:58.870 --> 02:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
texting or with their child who had
 
02:42:00.550 --> 02:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
missed the bus or
 
02:42:02.710 --> 02:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
with another person
 
02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
in the meeting
 
02:42:06.389 --> 02:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:42:09.910 --> 02:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
other questions representative horrigan
 
02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much um
 
02:42:16.150 --> 02:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
i think i think this bill makes some
 
02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:17.030 align:start position:0%
i think i think this bill makes some
makes

02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
makes
 
02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh makes a
 
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
provision for
 
02:42:21.429 --> 02:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
non-public meetings of the public body
 
02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
because uh which are appropriate under a
 
02:42:26.389 --> 02:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
variety of specified
 
02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:28.250 align:start position:0%
circumstances so does this allow
 
02:42:28.250 --> 02:42:29.429 align:start position:0%
circumstances so does this allow
[Music]

02:42:29.429 --> 02:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:42:30.550 --> 02:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
does this
 
02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
does this would this allow
 
02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
non-public meetings if the public body
 
02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
i believe that it is addressed in an
 
02:42:42.479 --> 02:42:44.630 align:start position:0%
i believe that it is addressed in an
earlier

02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
or part of 91a
 
02:42:49.110 --> 02:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
what uh those meetings happening
 
02:42:51.269 --> 02:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
telephonically or electronically that's
 
02:42:53.670 --> 02:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
addressed i believe elsewhere okay
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
thanks and
 
02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:55.830 align:start position:0%
thanks and
um

02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:58.950 --> 02:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
okay are there other questions
 
02:43:00.630 --> 02:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative wolper did you have
 
02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:03.510 align:start position:0%
representative wolper did you have
further

02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
too busy
 
02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:06.830 align:start position:0%
too busy
representative

02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:43:09.349 --> 02:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
chase you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:43:11.670 --> 02:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question out of curiosity
 
02:43:13.990 --> 02:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
because we just had a meeting last night
 
02:43:16.309 --> 02:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
for our uh county and i don't even know
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
if we had enough for a quorum some were
 
02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
zooming in
 
02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
no we didn't unfortunately
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
others were there physically how is that
 
02:43:28.630 --> 02:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
going to affect
 
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
this bill when it comes to having to
 
02:43:33.990 --> 02:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
vote and having your correct quorum
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking that is actually
 
02:43:38.710 --> 02:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest impetuses for this
 
02:43:40.230 --> 02:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:41.670 align:start position:0%
bill is
um

02:43:41.670 --> 02:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:44.389 --> 02:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
bodies who are having
 
02:43:47.110 --> 02:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
meetings with a physical location
 
02:43:50.309 --> 02:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
and having some people having to zoom in
 
02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
or to call in or
 
02:43:52.399 --> 02:43:53.670 align:start position:0%
or to call in or
uh

02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:56.550 align:start position:0%
uh
electronically

02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
allowing for there to be a quorum made
 
02:44:01.269 --> 02:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
by those who are in the physical
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
location and
 
02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
who are participating remotely
 
02:44:07.349 --> 02:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
because it
 
02:44:13.030 --> 02:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:15.750 --> 02:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
any other question representative sylvia
 
02:44:17.269 --> 02:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you ms chairman uh thank you for
 
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
taking my further question
 
02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:20.790 align:start position:0%
taking my further question
so

02:44:20.790 --> 02:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
public access to these
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
remote meetings
 
02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
what would happen in the case which
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
we've experienced where there's a storm
 
02:44:32.710 --> 02:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
there are power failures
 
02:44:34.870 --> 02:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
part of your citizenry may not be able
 
02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:35.750 align:start position:0%
part of your citizenry may not be able
to

02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:44:37.269 --> 02:44:37.279 align:start position:0%
attend or
 
02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
have access
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:45.510 --> 02:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
so there's a requirement if somebody is
 
02:44:47.429 --> 02:44:47.439 align:start position:0%
unable to attend
 
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
that they be in touch with there's a it
 
02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
has to be stated where they um contact
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
someone to say
 
02:44:58.389 --> 02:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
that they are unable to access um the
 
02:44:58.399 --> 02:44:59.990 align:start position:0%
that they are unable to access um the
remote

02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
remote
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
option in the meeting
 
02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:04.309 align:start position:0%
option in the meeting
but

02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:45:04.319 --> 02:45:05.429 align:start position:0%
but
beyond

02:45:05.429 --> 02:45:05.439 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
02:45:05.439 --> 02:45:06.870 align:start position:0%
beyond
that

02:45:06.870 --> 02:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:07.990 --> 02:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:45:09.510 --> 02:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
provision would be made that is made now
 
02:45:12.479 --> 02:45:13.269 align:start position:0%
provision would be made that is made now
for

02:45:13.269 --> 02:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:45:16.230 --> 02:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
folks who can't attend meetings
 
02:45:18.070 --> 02:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
because of
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
similar circumstances or other
 
02:45:23.269 --> 02:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
if half the town loses power
 
02:45:29.269 --> 02:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
i think your public body is going to
 
02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
make a particular decision about a
 
02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:32.630 align:start position:0%
make a particular decision about a
meeting

02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:33.910 align:start position:0%
meeting
right

02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:45:35.910 --> 02:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
they'll do the same thing i would
 
02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
suppose if there's a remote
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
option thank you
 
02:45:45.429 --> 02:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
02:45:50.309 --> 02:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:02.469 --> 02:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:36.630 --> 02:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:41.190 --> 02:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
i usually don't have a volume problem
 
02:46:45.190 --> 02:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
i'm representative stephen smith
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
sullivan county district 11 the towns of
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
akworth charlestown goshen langdon
 
02:46:51.429 --> 02:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
webster and washington
 
02:46:53.269 --> 02:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
so before i decide if a bill is a good
 
02:46:55.990 --> 02:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
idea or not i apply it to three
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
standards is it implementable affordable
 
02:47:00.309 --> 02:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
and enforceable
 
02:47:03.030 --> 02:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
this one's not the first and the last
 
02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
and i have no idea about the second
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
so here's technical problem number one
 
02:47:12.150 --> 02:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
if there is a problem with access
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
the media if the meeting shall be
 
02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:15.030 align:start position:0%
the media if the meeting shall be
adjourned

02:47:15.030 --> 02:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
adjourned
 
02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:16.389 align:start position:0%
adjourned
okay

02:47:16.389 --> 02:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:47:16.399 --> 02:47:17.269 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:47:17.269 --> 02:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
let's let's just do a use case on that
 
02:47:22.389 --> 02:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
you are all on your county delegations
 
02:47:24.150 --> 02:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
and you're painfully aware
 
02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
of the labyrinth of deadlines you have
 
02:47:27.910 --> 02:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
for your budget convention
 
02:47:29.269 --> 02:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
you present the budget you have a
 
02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
certain number of days to act on the
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
budget now if you were to have to do a
 
02:47:35.110 --> 02:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
couple of meetings in there you would be
 
02:47:37.030 --> 02:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
unable to comply with the notice
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
requirements of 91a which are not
 
02:47:41.269 --> 02:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
suspended by this bill so you got to
 
02:47:43.510 --> 02:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
give them five days notice
 
02:47:45.910 --> 02:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
so you're acting on the budget and let's
 
02:47:47.510 --> 02:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
assume you've gotten way ahead of your
 
02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
work that's awesome and you have six or
 
02:47:52.389 --> 02:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
seven days to go
 
02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
a guy from tuscaloosa calls in and says
 
02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
i can't access the feed
 
02:47:59.110 --> 02:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
i can't connect to the meeting you are
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
adjourned the minute that happens public
 
02:48:03.269 --> 02:48:03.279 align:start position:0%
isn't defined
 
02:48:06.710 --> 02:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
how many people isn't defined the minute
 
02:48:10.230 --> 02:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
gary from oklahoma calls in and says
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
i can't access the meeting you're done
 
02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
you're adjourned not reassessed not on a
 
02:48:17.190 --> 02:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
break to address it
 
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
so that that's poorly thought out
 
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the number is do you
 
02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
as a localized outage okay i don't know
 
02:48:26.870 --> 02:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
when the bill doesn't tell me does it
 
02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
have to be 30 or 40 people i don't know
 
02:48:33.750 --> 02:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:34.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:48:34.630 --> 02:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:37.510 --> 02:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
adjourned no no good and who is the
 
02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:38.870 align:start position:0%
adjourned no no good and who is the
public

02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
have you considered that
 
02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
we've seen examples where we have
 
02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
disruptors at public meetings who go
 
02:48:46.710 --> 02:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
there and
 
02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
engage in shenanigans to try to shut
 
02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
things down this bill is a fantastic
 
02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism for people to do exactly that
 
02:48:56.150 --> 02:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
particularly where a public body is up
 
02:48:58.710 --> 02:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
against a deadline you have folks call
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
in and say
 
02:49:02.550 --> 02:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
i can't access the meeting and you also
 
02:49:04.389 --> 02:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
haven't provided a mechanism to deal
 
02:49:05.349 --> 02:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:49:07.269 --> 02:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
so the minute they notify you you're
 
02:49:07.279 --> 02:49:08.950 align:start position:0%
so the minute they notify you you're
done

02:49:08.950 --> 02:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
i know this doesn't apply to the house
 
02:49:13.030 --> 02:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
but imagine mr chairman you are
 
02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
painfully aware of the ridiculous
 
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
deadlines that you have to comply with
 
02:49:20.230 --> 02:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
for report out dates and imagine how
 
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
easy it would be to just have every bill
 
02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
in this committee die by folks reporting
 
02:49:27.349 --> 02:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
outage problems
 
02:49:29.590 --> 02:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
so what happens when the person calls in
 
02:49:31.830 --> 02:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
with an access problem
 
02:49:34.070 --> 02:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
is it your problem is it their problem
 
02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
or does nothing happen does the meeting
 
02:49:39.030 --> 02:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
just end and then be subject to another
 
02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
91 91a required notification period i
 
02:49:50.389 --> 02:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:53.510 --> 02:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
so the the implementable and enforceable
 
02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:55.830 align:start position:0%
so the the implementable and enforceable
part

02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
part
 
02:49:57.190 --> 02:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
those are just non-starters now
 
02:49:58.950 --> 02:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
affordable so do you have to give the
 
02:50:00.870 --> 02:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
folks tech support
 
02:50:02.950 --> 02:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
if somebody calls in and says i'm trying
 
02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
to access your zoom meeting or your
 
02:50:06.790 --> 02:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
microsoft teams meeting or your go to
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
meeting meeting or whatever it is that
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
you've chosen to use
 
02:50:11.990 --> 02:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
one county was actually
 
02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
streaming their meetings live on
 
02:50:15.990 --> 02:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
facebook and taking comments and ask
 
02:50:17.590 --> 02:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
questions what if somebody had a problem
 
02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
with that or a slow connection when they
 
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
call in
 
02:50:23.750 --> 02:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
what happens what literally happens i
 
02:50:26.389 --> 02:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
don't know and the bill doesn't tell me
 
02:50:28.309 --> 02:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
just if they're having trouble accessing
 
02:50:33.670 --> 02:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:36.710 --> 02:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
if you get a nice laptop and a good
 
02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:37.750 align:start position:0%
if you get a nice laptop and a good
connection

02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
connection
 
02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
all of this probably seems really easy
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
i know people that don't have that that
 
02:50:44.870 --> 02:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
live in rural areas
 
02:50:47.030 --> 02:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
that use track phones where they pay for
 
02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
every minute are we really going to
 
02:50:51.590 --> 02:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
create a situation where you know what
 
02:50:53.349 --> 02:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
the weather's lousy select board's going
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
to stay home tonight and do this puppy
 
02:50:57.750 --> 02:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
completely virtually and a person is
 
02:51:00.309 --> 02:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
going to have to literally spend money
 
02:51:01.990 --> 02:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
to attend that meeting because there are
 
02:51:04.389 --> 02:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
people that pay for every minute or make
 
02:51:06.790 --> 02:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
a decision that i'm not going to call my
 
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
family a lot or make the other phone
 
02:51:10.630 --> 02:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
calls because i'm going to use the 60
 
02:51:12.790 --> 02:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
minutes that i have to attend this
 
02:51:15.590 --> 02:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
meeting please do not
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
allow any public body in new hampshire
 
02:51:20.389 --> 02:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
create a situation where somebody can
 
02:51:22.630 --> 02:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
literally be forced to pay money to
 
02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
participate in a public meeting that is
 
02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:25.750 align:start position:0%
participate in a public meeting that is
offensive

02:51:25.750 --> 02:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
offensive
 
02:51:27.750 --> 02:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
that reason alone you should itl the
 
02:51:27.760 --> 02:51:29.429 align:start position:0%
that reason alone you should itl the
bill

02:51:29.429 --> 02:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:51:31.190 --> 02:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
the last thing i'll leave you with is
 
02:51:33.190 --> 02:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
i've done committee trainings for new
 
02:51:35.269 --> 02:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
legislators in the past and one of the
 
02:51:37.830 --> 02:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
things i tell them is that
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
we all volunteered to do this and what
 
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
we are are public servants and literally
 
02:51:45.910 --> 02:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
the very least that we can do for the
 
02:51:45.920 --> 02:51:46.870 align:start position:0%
the very least that we can do for the
public

02:51:46.870 --> 02:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
is to go someplace where if they have no
 
02:51:51.190 --> 02:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
money or electronics or means
 
02:51:53.110 --> 02:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
we will sit before them where they can
 
02:51:55.990 --> 02:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
look at us and give them our 100 percent
 
02:51:58.630 --> 02:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
undivided attention face-to-face because
 
02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's what they deserve thank you mr
 
02:52:00.720 --> 02:52:02.469 align:start position:0%
that's what they deserve thank you mr
chair

02:52:02.469 --> 02:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:52:04.309 --> 02:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
questions for representative smith no
 
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:07.830 --> 02:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia do you have any
 
02:52:09.510 --> 02:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
02:52:11.190 --> 02:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
i've said what i needed to say today
 
02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair you don't wish to
 
02:52:14.710 --> 02:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
take questions i do not
 
02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative jake bear and that
 
02:52:38.309 --> 02:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:13.269 --> 02:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
sorry about that i'm here not just
 
02:53:16.950 --> 02:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
representing new futures but the
 
02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
thousands of individuals across the
 
02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
state who don't feel that they can
 
02:53:21.990 --> 02:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
safely access the legislature or make
 
02:53:23.510 --> 02:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
their voices heard at public hearings
 
02:53:24.630 --> 02:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
like this
 
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
under the current pandemic
 
02:53:30.150 --> 02:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
i've passed around uh written testimony
 
02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
i won't repeat too much of that i do
 
02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
want to address some of the points that
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
have been made
 
02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
first off i would say that this bill is
 
02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
not requiring anybody to meet remotely
 
02:53:41.030 --> 02:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
it is simply giving the option i know
 
02:53:43.429 --> 02:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
that this august body made the decision
 
02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
recently not to
 
02:53:47.349 --> 02:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
enact a remote option or to allow people
 
02:53:49.269 --> 02:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
to participate remotely i think
 
02:53:50.630 --> 02:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
communities around the state are just
 
02:53:52.870 --> 02:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
looking for the same option
 
02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
and to be able to make that choice for
 
02:53:54.319 --> 02:53:55.510 align:start position:0%
and to be able to make that choice for
themselves

02:53:55.510 --> 02:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:53:57.990 --> 02:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
secondly i will say that
 
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
many of these technical challenges that
 
02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative smith just highlighted
 
02:54:04.230 --> 02:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
our communities have spent the last year
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
figuring much of this out they many of
 
02:54:08.309 --> 02:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
them did move to remote meetings out of
 
02:54:08.319 --> 02:54:09.590 align:start position:0%
them did move to remote meetings out of
necessity

02:54:09.590 --> 02:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
necessity
 
02:54:11.110 --> 02:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
some of them would like to continue that
 
02:54:13.110 --> 02:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
they have figured out how to make this
 
02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
work for their communities
 
02:54:14.880 --> 02:54:15.590 align:start position:0%
work for their communities
i

02:54:15.590 --> 02:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
thirdly i would like to point out
 
02:54:19.110 --> 02:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative smith i certainly
 
02:54:20.309 --> 02:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know we certainly
 
02:54:22.230 --> 02:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate we as advocates as members of
 
02:54:23.750 --> 02:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
the public appreciate the time and
 
02:54:25.990 --> 02:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
attention uh that you give to us during
 
02:54:28.550 --> 02:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
these hearings in person uh but there
 
02:54:30.150 --> 02:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
are many people who are not able to get
 
02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
here as representative simpson mentioned
 
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
in her introduction we have elderly and
 
02:54:36.309 --> 02:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
disabled people who don't have access to
 
02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
transportation we have working people
 
02:54:40.230 --> 02:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
who have work conflicts who are not able
 
02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
to get here or to their public town
 
02:54:43.830 --> 02:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
meetings as well we have individuals who
 
02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
can't get child care these are people
 
02:54:48.309 --> 02:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
who are so directly impacted by the
 
02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
policies that this body
 
02:54:52.070 --> 02:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
weighs every day and they cannot get
 
02:54:54.309 --> 02:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
here to make their voice heard in person
 
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh enacting remote options to be able to
 
02:54:58.870 --> 02:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
participate from home would make it much
 
02:55:00.230 --> 02:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
easier for them to make their voices
 
02:55:01.590 --> 02:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
heard and be part of this legislative
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
process we hear from them every day
 
02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:05.910 align:start position:0%
process we hear from them every day
um

02:55:05.910 --> 02:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:07.590 --> 02:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
again they would like nothing more than
 
02:55:09.349 --> 02:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
to be here and speak before you but they
 
02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
they just can't make it work uh
 
02:55:14.070 --> 02:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the concerns some of
 
02:55:16.230 --> 02:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
the obstacles that we're seeing under
 
02:55:18.230 --> 02:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
the current pandemic with any luck will
 
02:55:20.469 --> 02:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
fade away soon but those economic
 
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
demographic geographic challenges won't
 
02:55:26.469 --> 02:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
so we we support the spill we ask that
 
02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
you give it more consideration
 
02:55:31.030 --> 02:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
one thing i will ask is that if you do
 
02:55:32.230 --> 02:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
decide to move forward with your
 
02:55:34.230 --> 02:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
contemplation of this bill uh in the
 
02:55:35.429 --> 02:55:35.439 align:start position:0%
case that
 
02:55:37.990 --> 02:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh we there is a physical location for a
 
02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:39.349 align:start position:0%
uh we there is a physical location for a
meeting

02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:55:41.590 --> 02:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
and there is a remote but members have
 
02:55:43.429 --> 02:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
the remote option to participate we ask
 
02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
that you consider adding language that
 
02:55:46.710 --> 02:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
we extend the same courtesy to the
 
02:55:48.870 --> 02:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
public allowing the public to
 
02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
participate virtually in the case of a
 
02:55:52.389 --> 02:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
meeting where there is a physical
 
02:55:52.399 --> 02:55:54.230 align:start position:0%
meeting where there is a physical
location

02:55:54.230 --> 02:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
location
 
02:55:55.269 --> 02:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to take
 
02:55:55.279 --> 02:55:56.469 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to take
questions

02:55:56.469 --> 02:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative honor
 
02:56:03.510 --> 02:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:56:05.429 --> 02:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that
 
02:56:07.510 --> 02:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
members of the public who can't come
 
02:56:10.150 --> 02:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
physically can send us an email call us
 
02:56:11.830 --> 02:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
or drop us a letter in the mail like
 
02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
they always have before coven
 
02:56:16.950 --> 02:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
certainly so but you know has been
 
02:56:18.469 --> 02:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned several times this morning
 
02:56:19.590 --> 02:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:56:21.510 --> 02:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
i won't say face-to-face contact but you
 
02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:22.389 align:start position:0%
i won't say face-to-face contact but you
know

02:56:22.389 --> 02:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:56:23.830 --> 02:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
you see the value of face-to-face
 
02:56:26.469 --> 02:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
contact now while virtual access may not
 
02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
replicate that entirely i think that
 
02:56:30.309 --> 02:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
there is the opportunity virtually to
 
02:56:31.670 --> 02:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
express um
 
02:56:33.750 --> 02:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
a sort of emotion direct connection to
 
02:56:35.269 --> 02:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
an issue that you're not able to do over
 
02:56:37.590 --> 02:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
the phone or through written testimony
 
02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
but certainly i understand the options
 
02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:45.269 --> 02:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
representative horgan did you have a
 
02:56:48.710 --> 02:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
question um yes one thing i found
 
02:56:50.550 --> 02:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
when we're doing the remote meetings in
 
02:56:55.990 --> 02:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
20 20 20 20 21 that it was easier for uh
 
02:56:58.070 --> 02:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
was easier for handicapped individuals
 
02:56:59.990 --> 02:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
to participate they were not at a
 
02:57:01.510 --> 02:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
disadvantage compared with others
 
02:57:02.790 --> 02:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
although maybe we could have made it
 
02:57:04.389 --> 02:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
better for people who were sight
 
02:57:04.399 --> 02:57:06.630 align:start position:0%
better for people who were sight
impaired

02:57:06.630 --> 02:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
impaired
 
02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:57:09.429 --> 02:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
and this may be like a subject for a
 
02:57:10.710 --> 02:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
different bill but do you think it'd be
 
02:57:13.190 --> 02:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to add something that said
 
02:57:15.190 --> 02:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
physical locations for meetings should
 
02:57:19.269 --> 02:57:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:21.750 --> 02:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
certainly i i imagine uh that's that's
 
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
addressed in different uh different
 
02:57:24.790 --> 02:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
parts of statute but certainly i think
 
02:57:26.469 --> 02:57:26.479 align:start position:0%
that ensuring that our meetings are
 
02:57:29.030 --> 02:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
accessible uh physically uh to to
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
everyone is certainly an important point
 
02:57:31.990 --> 02:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
to be addressed either through this
 
02:57:34.830 --> 02:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:38.309 --> 02:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um and with communities you
 
02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
serve many of them are of limited means
 
02:57:43.110 --> 02:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
and uh the deputy speaker did speak very
 
02:57:45.030 --> 02:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
eloquently about those who have limited
 
02:57:46.630 --> 02:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
means um
 
02:57:48.309 --> 02:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
what can be done to make sure that
 
02:57:51.110 --> 02:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
people who don't have a fancy laptop or
 
02:57:53.349 --> 02:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
can still uh at least
 
02:57:55.670 --> 02:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
at least still zoom in or use another
 
02:57:55.680 --> 02:57:56.790 align:start position:0%
at least still zoom in or use another
software

02:57:56.790 --> 02:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
software
 
02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
to attend the meeting so first thank you
 
02:58:00.870 --> 02:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
for the question representative uh
 
02:58:02.230 --> 02:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
first i'd love to make the point i think
 
02:58:04.469 --> 02:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
that many individuals who are
 
02:58:06.950 --> 02:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
at least able to afford the technology
 
02:58:09.110 --> 02:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to zoom into meetings or
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
participate virtually are likely those
 
02:58:13.429 --> 02:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
who are least able to get to concord to
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
attend meetings as well
 
02:58:17.510 --> 02:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
and may be true to get to their own town
 
02:58:19.670 --> 02:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
halls or local meetings again due to
 
02:58:21.830 --> 02:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
work conflicts lack of child care so on
 
02:58:24.790 --> 02:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
and so forth um but that said you know i
 
02:58:26.389 --> 02:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
think that uh
 
02:58:27.670 --> 02:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know i think some of the greatest
 
02:58:29.830 --> 02:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
challenges are not just in individuals
 
02:58:31.990 --> 02:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh the technology that an individual has
 
02:58:33.990 --> 02:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
at home but overall broadband access or
 
02:58:35.510 --> 02:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
internet access and communities and i
 
02:58:36.710 --> 02:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
know that there's a you know great
 
02:58:36.720 --> 02:58:37.670 align:start position:0%
know that there's a you know great
effort

02:58:37.670 --> 02:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
effort
 
02:58:39.670 --> 02:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know through federal arpa
 
02:58:41.910 --> 02:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
funds and other uh you know other uh
 
02:58:43.830 --> 02:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
funding sources to be able to address
 
02:58:45.670 --> 02:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
that so i think that honestly is likely
 
02:58:47.830 --> 02:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
the biggest obstacle to people being
 
02:58:50.070 --> 02:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
able to in regards to connectivity in
 
02:58:51.349 --> 02:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
the state uh that's something we're
 
02:58:52.790 --> 02:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
working on and we'll need to continue to
 
02:58:54.389 --> 02:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
work on but
 
02:58:56.230 --> 02:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
again certainly i mean not everybody has
 
02:58:58.469 --> 02:58:58.479 align:start position:0%
a brand new shiny laptop but again i
 
02:59:00.550 --> 02:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
would say those who are uh face those
 
02:59:02.230 --> 02:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
those technology challenges are often
 
02:59:03.269 --> 02:59:03.279 align:start position:0%
the ones who face the greatest
 
02:59:04.870 --> 02:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
challenges in getting into meetings in
 
02:59:07.750 --> 02:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:10.150 --> 02:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:59:11.990 --> 02:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:59:13.910 --> 02:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
02:59:15.510 --> 02:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
02:59:18.230 --> 02:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about um broadband and computer
 
02:59:21.910 --> 02:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
access for different communities um
 
02:59:23.750 --> 02:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
do you think that
 
02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:59:29.590 --> 02:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:31.830 --> 02:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
computer programs in school where kids
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
can bring like
 
02:59:35.429 --> 02:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
you know ipads home
 
02:59:35.439 --> 02:59:36.389 align:start position:0%
you know ipads home
so

02:59:36.389 --> 02:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
do you think it's worth exploring how
 
02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:40.070 align:start position:0%
do you think it's worth exploring how
many

02:59:40.070 --> 02:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
many
 
02:59:40.080 --> 02:59:40.950 align:start position:0%
many
people

02:59:40.950 --> 02:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:59:42.389 --> 02:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
or how many families
 
02:59:44.630 --> 02:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
participated in that type of program to
 
02:59:46.710 --> 02:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
just get an idea of who has broadband
 
02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
and who doesn't
 
02:59:48.640 --> 02:59:49.590 align:start position:0%
and who doesn't
yeah

02:59:49.590 --> 02:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:59:51.750 --> 02:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
certainly i think that could be a
 
02:59:53.510 --> 02:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
sort of important important information
 
02:59:54.870 --> 02:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
source i think they're all they're
 
02:59:56.150 --> 02:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
programs like that not just through
 
02:59:57.830 --> 02:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
schools but through community libraries
 
02:59:59.190 --> 02:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
as well uh
 
03:00:01.110 --> 03:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
so yes i think that that's a a great way
 
03:00:03.030 --> 03:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to sort of begin to assess
 
03:00:04.950 --> 03:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
what uh the technology techno
 
03:00:07.349 --> 03:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
technological capacities of individuals
 
03:00:09.349 --> 03:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
and families are across the state um but
 
03:00:10.950 --> 03:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
i think to that point through sort of
 
03:00:13.429 --> 03:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
lending programs like that uh technology
 
03:00:15.830 --> 03:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
is available and and you know whether
 
03:00:17.990 --> 03:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's take-home technology through ipads
 
03:00:19.830 --> 03:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
and so on or it's computers available at
 
03:00:21.670 --> 03:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
libraries there are i think that once
 
03:00:24.150 --> 03:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
you open the door to remote access there
 
03:00:25.910 --> 03:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
are ways to bridge that divide and make
 
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
that happen uh in a way that's easier to
 
03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
than than
 
03:00:31.590 --> 03:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
enabling everybody to make it to an
 
03:00:33.670 --> 03:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
in-person meeting here or at other
 
03:00:37.269 --> 03:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
public office settings
 
03:00:39.670 --> 03:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you thank you very
 
03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:45.590 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you thank you very
much

03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:58.550 --> 03:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:01.349 --> 03:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i uh it was
 
03:01:03.030 --> 03:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
wanting to get down to another hearing
 
03:01:06.389 --> 03:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate you having me up now i'm
 
03:01:08.309 --> 03:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
representative jess edwards
 
03:01:11.349 --> 03:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
i represent auburn chester and sandown
 
03:01:14.550 --> 03:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
and um as i read this bill and as as
 
03:01:17.750 --> 03:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
i've listened to the prior testimony
 
03:01:19.590 --> 03:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
it strikes me
 
03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:21.110 align:start position:0%
it strikes me
that

03:01:21.110 --> 03:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:22.870 --> 03:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're conflating
 
03:01:25.190 --> 03:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
two different populations that we really
 
03:01:27.110 --> 03:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
ought to hold distinct
 
03:01:28.630 --> 03:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:01:30.870 --> 03:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
most of this law which is intended to
 
03:01:30.880 --> 03:01:31.830 align:start position:0%
most of this law which is intended to
address

03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:01:34.790 --> 03:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
the the public body meaning you know the
 
03:01:37.429 --> 03:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
elected or appointed individuals who
 
03:01:39.150 --> 03:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
03:01:41.670 --> 03:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to the public
 
03:01:43.830 --> 03:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
and the public itself
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
03:01:49.990 --> 03:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
i i think we can probably all agree
 
03:01:53.429 --> 03:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
that we like the idea of transparency i
 
03:01:55.830 --> 03:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
i think section one article eight of our
 
03:01:58.630 --> 03:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
constitution encourages us to be as
 
03:02:00.550 --> 03:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
transparent as we can with the public
 
03:02:04.070 --> 03:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
and so um so given that we have so much
 
03:02:06.710 --> 03:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
experience with the technology i think i
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
think it's great to the extent that we
 
03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh people can uh different districts can
 
03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
afford it
 
03:02:15.429 --> 03:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
uh to go ahead and
 
03:02:18.389 --> 03:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
broadcast it so that the public can uh
 
03:02:21.030 --> 03:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
see what's happening
 
03:02:24.230 --> 03:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
the the issue i run into though is um
 
03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:25.429 align:start position:0%
the the issue i run into though is um
watching

03:02:25.429 --> 03:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
watching
 
03:02:26.950 --> 03:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
the behavior
 
03:02:29.590 --> 03:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
of the general court
 
03:02:32.469 --> 03:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
in the pandemic versus the general the
 
03:02:34.870 --> 03:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
behavior of the general court prior to
 
03:02:36.950 --> 03:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
03:02:40.070 --> 03:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
it validated for me a few truths
 
03:02:43.990 --> 03:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
is that elected officials are human
 
03:02:46.230 --> 03:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
as humans we have
 
03:02:46.240 --> 03:02:47.590 align:start position:0%
as humans we have
social

03:02:47.590 --> 03:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
social
 
03:02:50.790 --> 03:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
needs we're social animals
 
03:02:53.269 --> 03:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous amount of
 
03:02:53.279 --> 03:02:54.750 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous amount of
communication

03:02:54.750 --> 03:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
communication
 
03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:56.550 align:start position:0%
communication
socialization

03:02:56.550 --> 03:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
socialization
 
03:02:56.560 --> 03:02:57.670 align:start position:0%
socialization
norming

03:02:57.670 --> 03:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
norming
 
03:02:59.269 --> 03:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
that takes place
 
03:03:02.550 --> 03:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
in person-to-person interaction
 
03:03:04.389 --> 03:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
and without that person-to-person
 
03:03:04.399 --> 03:03:06.070 align:start position:0%
and without that person-to-person
interaction

03:03:06.070 --> 03:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
03:03:07.830 --> 03:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult
 
03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:08.790 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult
to

03:03:08.790 --> 03:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:03:08.800 --> 03:03:10.150 align:start position:0%
to
transmit

03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
transmit
 
03:03:12.870 --> 03:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
a full communication i think
 
03:03:15.750 --> 03:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know communication uh researchers
 
03:03:18.469 --> 03:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
have indicated that over 50
 
03:03:20.230 --> 03:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
of what people communicate to one
 
03:03:22.230 --> 03:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
another is through non-verbal
 
03:03:24.309 --> 03:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
communication the intonation of their
 
03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
vote voice their their body language um
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
just just their mannerisms
 
03:03:33.990 --> 03:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
are as much as the communication process
 
03:03:36.309 --> 03:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
as the the words
 
03:03:40.150 --> 03:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
and um because of that i'll just dip for
 
03:03:41.830 --> 03:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
a moment into
 
03:03:44.550 --> 03:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
line 23 of page 1
 
03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
where it says that
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
if you're if you don't have a physical
 
03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
location the public could participate by
 
03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:52.389 align:start position:0%
location the public could participate by
telephone

03:03:52.389 --> 03:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
telephone
 
03:03:55.510 --> 03:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i i would recommend
 
03:03:57.990 --> 03:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
just generally not
 
03:03:58.000 --> 03:03:59.510 align:start position:0%
just generally not
having

03:03:59.510 --> 03:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
having
 
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
telephone be a favored way of
 
03:04:04.230 --> 03:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
communicating to the public people run
 
03:04:04.240 --> 03:04:05.269 align:start position:0%
communicating to the public people run
into

03:04:05.269 --> 03:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:04:07.349 --> 03:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
attention span issues
 
03:04:09.510 --> 03:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
you you definitely don't get any of the
 
03:04:12.469 --> 03:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
non-verbal communication from from body
 
03:04:15.429 --> 03:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
language and so i just i would just rate
 
03:04:18.070 --> 03:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
telephone as an inadequate
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
way of communicating a public body's
 
03:04:24.230 --> 03:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
meeting to the public
 
03:04:26.950 --> 03:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'd also point out that
 
03:04:29.269 --> 03:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
the public has a right to peacefully
 
03:04:29.279 --> 03:04:30.790 align:start position:0%
the public has a right to peacefully
assemble

03:04:30.790 --> 03:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
assemble
 
03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:32.309 align:start position:0%
assemble
and

03:04:32.309 --> 03:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:04:35.190 --> 03:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
if i were
 
03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:36.469 align:start position:0%
if i were
someone

03:04:36.469 --> 03:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
someone
 
03:04:39.349 --> 03:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
running a public meeting and i felt
 
03:04:41.190 --> 03:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
there was a great deal of public
 
03:04:44.790 --> 03:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
pressure a lot of anxiety a lot of angst
 
03:04:47.110 --> 03:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
where the public might want to come
 
03:04:49.110 --> 03:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
publicly demonstrate
 
03:04:51.590 --> 03:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
as a way for the public to communicate
 
03:04:53.670 --> 03:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
with us
 
03:04:55.429 --> 03:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
i could see
 
03:04:58.309 --> 03:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
the motivation to go to an all remote
 
03:05:00.150 --> 03:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
all virtual meeting
 
03:05:02.870 --> 03:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
because by doing that
 
03:05:04.389 --> 03:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
you isolate
 
03:05:07.990 --> 03:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
the public officials from the people
 
03:05:11.190 --> 03:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
you you don't get you know what my in my
 
03:05:13.510 --> 03:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
first term i was on health and human
 
03:05:16.309 --> 03:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
services and we were doing a lot of uh
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
transgender bills and we would have to
 
03:05:21.830 --> 03:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
go to rep's hall because
 
03:05:25.590 --> 03:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
um you'd end up with uh 200 people who
 
03:05:27.110 --> 03:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
were there
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
that even if they didn't want to talk
 
03:05:32.630 --> 03:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
their presence was itself a form of
 
03:05:32.640 --> 03:05:34.070 align:start position:0%
their presence was itself a form of
communication

03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
communication
 
03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
and if you have if we have virtual
 
03:05:37.680 --> 03:05:38.790 align:start position:0%
and if you have if we have virtual
meetings

03:05:38.790 --> 03:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
03:05:40.550 --> 03:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
the public cannot
 
03:05:42.550 --> 03:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
have that kind of
 
03:05:46.630 --> 03:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
communication effect of having their
 
03:05:48.309 --> 03:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
physical mass
 
03:05:48.319 --> 03:05:49.429 align:start position:0%
physical mass
present

03:05:49.429 --> 03:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
present
 
03:05:51.830 --> 03:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
so so i would think we would be losing
 
03:05:54.150 --> 03:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
something extremely valuable
 
03:05:56.309 --> 03:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh if we were to go
 
03:05:58.469 --> 03:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
to allow public meetings to always be
 
03:05:58.479 --> 03:05:59.590 align:start position:0%
to allow public meetings to always be
virtual

03:05:59.590 --> 03:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
virtual
 
03:05:59.600 --> 03:06:00.389 align:start position:0%
virtual
i

03:06:00.389 --> 03:06:00.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:06:02.309 --> 03:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
i would also like to point out that in
 
03:06:03.990 --> 03:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
the existing law
 
03:06:07.429 --> 03:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
if if a member is unable to participate
 
03:06:09.830 --> 03:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
in a centralized meeting
 
03:06:12.309 --> 03:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
there's still a method in the law
 
03:06:14.230 --> 03:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
for them to get an exemption and just
 
03:06:16.309 --> 03:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
have the exemption carried over into the
 
03:06:18.150 --> 03:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
minutes of why they weren't physically
 
03:06:20.469 --> 03:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
present so it's it's not like we don't
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
have some flexibility for the
 
03:06:26.070 --> 03:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
public officials currently in law it's
 
03:06:26.080 --> 03:06:27.110 align:start position:0%
public officials currently in law it's
um

03:06:27.110 --> 03:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:27.120 --> 03:06:27.910 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:06:30.309 --> 03:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
it it it's there so
 
03:06:30.319 --> 03:06:31.429 align:start position:0%
it it it's there so
um

03:06:31.429 --> 03:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:31.439 --> 03:06:32.710 align:start position:0%
um
perhaps

03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
03:06:35.190 --> 03:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
someday when the metaverse is fully
 
03:06:35.200 --> 03:06:36.309 align:start position:0%
someday when the metaverse is fully
mature

03:06:36.309 --> 03:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
mature
 
03:06:37.910 --> 03:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
and we can all
 
03:06:40.950 --> 03:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know put on the suits and in in in
 
03:06:44.230 --> 03:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
the virtual reality kicks in and we can
 
03:06:44.240 --> 03:06:45.269 align:start position:0%
the virtual reality kicks in and we can
see

03:06:45.269 --> 03:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:06:47.590 --> 03:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
everybody um you know maybe the
 
03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
technology will be good enough at that
 
03:06:53.750 --> 03:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
point to uh conduct routinely
 
03:06:55.670 --> 03:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
our public meetings
 
03:06:57.269 --> 03:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
virtually but
 
03:06:59.349 --> 03:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't believe the technology's
 
03:07:01.990 --> 03:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
there at this point and um
 
03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
and i and and and i think that part of
 
03:07:06.790 --> 03:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
being a public official and volunteering
 
03:07:10.309 --> 03:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
for this job is to realize the demands
 
03:07:12.230 --> 03:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
that it'll place on you
 
03:07:14.870 --> 03:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
and be prepared to either meet those
 
03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
demands or to allow somebody to take
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
your place
 
03:07:21.429 --> 03:07:21.439 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:07:24.790 --> 03:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
so with that um i'll take questions i'll
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
even pretend i'm representative smith
 
03:07:29.910 --> 03:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
and answer questions like i'm him but

03:07:59.680 --> 03:08:04.830 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:08:04.830 --> 03:08:04.840 align:start position:0%

the record my name is paulie campion i
 
03:08:18.710 --> 03:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
am a former state representative a
 
03:08:21.750 --> 03:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
retired nurse and today i am here

representing the new hampshire nurses
 
03:08:23.279 --> 03:08:24.710 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire nurses
association

03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
association
 
03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
in support of hb 1014
 
03:08:29.670 --> 03:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
as you know this bill does several
 
03:08:32.710 --> 03:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
things it establishes requirement for
 
03:08:35.349 --> 03:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
remote access to public meetings
 
03:08:37.910 --> 03:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
it strikes the requirement for persons
 
03:08:39.990 --> 03:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
to be present in a specific physical
 
03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:41.429 align:start position:0%
to be present in a specific physical
location

03:08:41.429 --> 03:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
location
 
03:08:43.510 --> 03:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
it strikes the determination of an
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
emergency be made by the chair of the
 
03:08:47.910 --> 03:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
presiding officer so there are others
 
03:08:49.750 --> 03:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
who may determine that
 
03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
and it adds the requirement that public
 
03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
access can be provided by telephone
 
03:08:57.269 --> 03:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
video or other means excluding chat
 
03:08:59.429 --> 03:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
rooms so you know that you've read the
 
03:08:59.439 --> 03:09:01.110 align:start position:0%
rooms so you know that you've read the
bill

03:09:01.110 --> 03:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:09:03.190 --> 03:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
remote access to public meetings was
 
03:09:03.200 --> 03:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
remote access to public meetings was
available

03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:09:06.309 --> 03:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic pursuant to
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
emergency order number 12. and in fact
 
03:09:12.309 --> 03:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
this bill has many um
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
components to it that actually look as
 
03:09:18.070 --> 03:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
if they are similar to that emergency
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
order many of the provisions
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
during the state of emergency this
 
03:09:24.469 --> 03:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
allowed members of the public to
 
03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
participate safely regardless of their
 
03:09:26.960 --> 03:09:28.070 align:start position:0%
participate safely regardless of their
location

03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
location
 
03:09:30.790 --> 03:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
via the use of video or telephone
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
the significantly reduced barriers to
 
03:09:35.429 --> 03:09:35.439 align:start position:0%
participation for members of the public
 
03:09:38.150 --> 03:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
as well as elected officials
 
03:09:40.790 --> 03:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
nurses throughout the state seek to be
 
03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
engaged in activities of public bodies
 
03:09:47.269 --> 03:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
local regional or statewide boards
 
03:09:49.349 --> 03:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
committees commissions or legislative
 
03:09:49.359 --> 03:09:50.630 align:start position:0%
committees commissions or legislative
bodies

03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
03:09:52.870 --> 03:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
with more than twenty thousand licensed
 
03:09:55.349 --> 03:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
registered nurses plus another three
 
03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
thousand plus licensed practical nurses
 
03:10:00.870 --> 03:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
and untold numbers of licensed nursing
 
03:10:00.880 --> 03:10:02.550 align:start position:0%
and untold numbers of licensed nursing
assistants

03:10:02.550 --> 03:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
assistants
 
03:10:05.269 --> 03:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
they work in a wide variety of roles and
 
03:10:05.279 --> 03:10:06.790 align:start position:0%
they work in a wide variety of roles and
institutions

03:10:06.790 --> 03:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
03:10:09.750 --> 03:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine they also bring
 
03:10:11.990 --> 03:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
a wealth of knowledge and experience to
 
03:10:14.790 --> 03:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
policy deliberations particularly those
 
03:10:18.229 --> 03:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
related to a public health emergency
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic nurses have been
 
03:10:21.910 --> 03:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
stretched to their limits
 
03:10:24.070 --> 03:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
and find it increasingly difficult to
 
03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
carve out time to travel to meetings
 
03:10:28.389 --> 03:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
that require in-person presence for
 
03:10:28.399 --> 03:10:29.990 align:start position:0%
that require in-person presence for
participation

03:10:29.990 --> 03:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
participation
 
03:10:32.070 --> 03:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
rather than being able to take a lunch
 
03:10:32.080 --> 03:10:33.030 align:start position:0%
rather than being able to take a lunch
break

03:10:33.030 --> 03:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
break
 
03:10:35.030 --> 03:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
and tune into a meeting and provide
 
03:10:38.550 --> 03:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
testimony or offer their opinion
 
03:10:41.429 --> 03:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
they are not able to participate
 
03:10:42.950 --> 03:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
and many nurses are hesitant to
 
03:10:45.110 --> 03:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
participate in indoor gatherings that
 
03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
may put them at further risk of exposure
 
03:10:49.750 --> 03:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
as they contemplate further stressing
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
their own colleagues and health care
 
03:10:53.590 --> 03:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
agencies already functioning with
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
limited staff
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's particularly difficult for those
 
03:10:59.590 --> 03:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
that may be immunocompromised or living
 
03:11:01.590 --> 03:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
in a great distance
 
03:11:03.990 --> 03:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
the expiration of the executive order
 
03:11:05.910 --> 03:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
allowing fully remote meetings of public
 
03:11:08.550 --> 03:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
bodies has exacerbated the difficulty
 
03:11:10.389 --> 03:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
that many nurses experience in
 
03:11:12.389 --> 03:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
participating in the discourse of public
 
03:11:14.469 --> 03:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
bodies including those of the new
 
03:11:16.389 --> 03:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire general court
 
03:11:18.229 --> 03:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
hb 1014
 
03:11:20.070 --> 03:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
removing the requirement for a physical
 
03:11:22.870 --> 03:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
location would allow greater flexibility
 
03:11:25.269 --> 03:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
for those wishing to participate
 
03:11:27.510 --> 03:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
creating equity of access between and
 
03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
among all residents and public office
 
03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:31.110 align:start position:0%
among all residents and public office
holders

03:11:31.110 --> 03:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
holders
 
03:11:33.110 --> 03:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and attention
 
03:11:34.790 --> 03:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
and on behalf of the new hampshire
 
03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
nurses association we encourage you to
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass on hb 1014.
 
03:11:44.309 --> 03:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
you may also have seen that i submitted
 
03:11:45.830 --> 03:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the
 
03:11:48.389 --> 03:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state commission on aging
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
slightly different testimony
 
03:11:51.990 --> 03:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
and if i might add just a couple of
 
03:11:54.389 --> 03:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
comments from that body
 
03:11:57.190 --> 03:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
as i'm as i'm sitting here
 
03:11:58.710 --> 03:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
i happen to chair the state commission
 
03:12:00.229 --> 03:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
on aging
 
03:12:02.870 --> 03:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
we are a combined
 
03:12:05.750 --> 03:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
body that includes both state agency
 
03:12:08.790 --> 03:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
representatives as well as members from
 
03:12:11.110 --> 03:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
from the public subject medic experts
 
03:12:12.870 --> 03:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
from all 10 counties
 
03:12:15.510 --> 03:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
we have been unable to
 
03:12:18.389 --> 03:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
achieve an in-person quorum which in our
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
particular body would be 13 members we
 
03:12:22.790 --> 03:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
had had our annual or our monthly
 
03:12:24.550 --> 03:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
meeting on monday
 
03:12:28.070 --> 03:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
we had 11 people participating in person
 
03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
and were unable therefore to
 
03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
execute on activities
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the commission
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
the charge to the commission is to
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
advise you all
 
03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
the governor and the general court about
 
03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
policy matters relating to older adults
 
03:12:47.990 --> 03:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
and aging policy issues we were unable
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
to take actions having to do with
 
03:12:52.630 --> 03:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
transportation which is one of the two
 
03:12:55.510 --> 03:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
top issues that older adults identify as
 
03:12:58.229 --> 03:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
challenges that they have
 
03:13:01.110 --> 03:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
so with that i will i will um take off
 
03:13:03.910 --> 03:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
both hats um and
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
i'm available to answer questions if
 
03:13:08.150 --> 03:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
there are any are there questions for
 
03:13:10.389 --> 03:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
former representative campion yes
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative smith

on this side but that was your choice
 
03:13:20.560 --> 03:13:23.030 align:start position:0%
on this side but that was your choice
um

03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:25.910 --> 03:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
you say that you submitted testimony to
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
us from
 
03:13:30.229 --> 03:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
the commission on aging can you tell me
 
03:13:33.429 --> 03:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
where or how because i have not seen
 
03:13:37.990 --> 03:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
such testimony i use the online link
 
03:13:39.830 --> 03:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
attached document
 
03:13:43.030 --> 03:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
and hit submit thank you very much
 
03:13:45.030 --> 03:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
i'm so glad you mentioned that because
 
03:13:49.030 --> 03:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
we have already inquired today on
 
03:13:51.590 --> 03:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
the leadership in the in the house
 
03:13:53.910 --> 03:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
as to
 
03:13:55.750 --> 03:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
what happens with
 
03:13:57.510 --> 03:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
materials that go to the portal because
 
03:13:59.030 --> 03:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
at the moment they seem to go down the
 
03:14:01.269 --> 03:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole so now we know to look for
 
03:14:02.950 --> 03:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
it and thank you very much thank you
 
03:14:05.429 --> 03:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
that's helpful to know there have been
 
03:14:06.950 --> 03:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions in which uh
 
03:14:08.630 --> 03:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues of mine has submitted a
 
03:14:12.309 --> 03:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
testimony that way so that's interesting
 
03:14:13.990 --> 03:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan thank you very
 
03:14:17.030 --> 03:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
much mr chair and thank you very much uh
 
03:14:18.309 --> 03:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
i still think he was representing
 
03:14:22.469 --> 03:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:24.389 --> 03:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
as a as a nurse and as a member of the
 
03:14:26.309 --> 03:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
commission the agent you deal more with
 
03:14:28.469 --> 03:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
people who have disabilities than in the
 
03:14:30.550 --> 03:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
past so if you found that um the remote
 
03:14:30.560 --> 03:14:32.309 align:start position:0%
past so if you found that um the remote
technology

03:14:32.309 --> 03:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
technology
 
03:14:32.319 --> 03:14:33.590 align:start position:0%
technology
enables

03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
enables
 
03:14:34.510 --> 03:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
populations who
 
03:14:34.520 --> 03:14:35.910 align:start position:0%
populations who
[Music]

03:14:35.910 --> 03:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:14:37.349 --> 03:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
can't make it to the state house to
 
03:14:39.670 --> 03:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
participate because
 
03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely and i think it's it's
 
03:14:43.830 --> 03:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
interesting to
 
03:14:46.309 --> 03:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
note that those of us who are here to
 
03:14:49.590 --> 03:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
testify either for or against this bill
 
03:14:52.150 --> 03:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
um are either
 
03:14:54.550 --> 03:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
we either have jobs that
 
03:14:56.309 --> 03:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
include this activity as part of our
 
03:14:59.750 --> 03:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
role or we're retired in my case
 
03:15:03.429 --> 03:15:03.439 align:start position:0%
i don't see any people who are working
 
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
regular daytime jobs or
 
03:15:07.590 --> 03:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
conversely are sleeping because they've
 
03:15:08.950 --> 03:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
worked overnight
 
03:15:11.590 --> 03:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
03:15:13.349 --> 03:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
yep follow up thank you mr chair thank
 
03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
you uh the honorable
 
03:15:17.910 --> 03:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
poly campion um
 
03:15:21.190 --> 03:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
the physical relations this may this may
 
03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
not be the proper vehicle for the bill
 
03:15:24.229 --> 03:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
but there are issues with physical
 
03:15:25.990 --> 03:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
locations not being
 
03:15:27.590 --> 03:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
accessible to those with handicaps
 
03:15:30.870 --> 03:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
especially mobility handicaps so
 
03:15:32.309 --> 03:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not we try to
 
03:15:34.710 --> 03:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
put any language in this bill
 
03:15:36.309 --> 03:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
what should we do to make the physical
 
03:15:38.710 --> 03:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
locations more accessible to a wider
 
03:15:38.720 --> 03:15:40.790 align:start position:0%
locations more accessible to a wider
population

03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
population
 
03:15:42.950 --> 03:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question i think it
 
03:15:44.870 --> 03:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
probably is beyond the scope of this
 
03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:15:49.190 --> 03:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
but would absolutely encourage um
 
03:15:51.670 --> 03:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
particularly all public buildings
 
03:15:53.590 --> 03:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
um to be
 
03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
made accessible to those with
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:04.710 --> 03:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
other questions representative wolper
 
03:16:06.389 --> 03:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:16:10.070 --> 03:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:12.790 --> 03:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
was the uh nurses association able to
 
03:16:15.670 --> 03:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
meet before the pandemic
 
03:16:18.550 --> 03:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
the well the nurses association
 
03:16:20.309 --> 03:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
is not a public body
 
03:16:22.229 --> 03:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh we're a membership membership
 
03:16:24.950 --> 03:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
association and so we do not um suffer
 
03:16:26.550 --> 03:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
from the restrictions of needing to have
 
03:16:28.150 --> 03:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
a physical location
 
03:16:30.790 --> 03:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
um the uh to me
 
03:16:33.349 --> 03:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic we did meet
 
03:16:35.670 --> 03:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
in a physical location and adjusted
 
03:16:37.110 --> 03:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and have been
 
03:16:38.550 --> 03:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
meeting remotely
 
03:16:38.560 --> 03:16:40.309 align:start position:0%
meeting remotely
um

03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:44.710 --> 03:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:46.950 --> 03:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps i'm confused
 
03:16:48.790 --> 03:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
i thought you were talking about maybe
 
03:16:50.229 --> 03:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
you were talking about the council on
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
aging that was hasn't
 
03:16:53.750 --> 03:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
is supposed to advise this party but
 
03:16:56.950 --> 03:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:58.469 --> 03:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
were they able to meet before the
 
03:16:58.479 --> 03:17:00.950 align:start position:0%
were they able to meet before the
pandemic

03:17:00.950 --> 03:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
03:17:03.429 --> 03:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um they were
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
able to meet before the pandemic and in
 
03:17:05.439 --> 03:17:06.389 align:start position:0%
able to meet before the pandemic and in
part

03:17:06.389 --> 03:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
part
 
03:17:08.309 --> 03:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
they were able to meet because the body
 
03:17:09.750 --> 03:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
was smaller
 
03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
and they were reimbursed for mileage
 
03:17:14.790 --> 03:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
which they are not currently the members
 
03:17:16.229 --> 03:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
were reimbursed for their mileage which
 
03:17:18.870 --> 03:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
they are currently not um
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
able to do and the membership has
 
03:17:23.190 --> 03:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
expanded to include people who um for
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
instance we have a ceo of a as a member
 
03:17:29.190 --> 03:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
of a community health center
 
03:17:31.190 --> 03:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
in coast county
 
03:17:32.790 --> 03:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine during the pandemic
 
03:17:36.229 --> 03:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's hard for him to carve out time
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
to attend a two-hour meeting on a monday
 
03:17:38.160 --> 03:17:39.190 align:start position:0%
to attend a two-hour meeting on a monday
morning

03:17:39.190 --> 03:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
morning
 
03:17:41.110 --> 03:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
between and among all of his other other
 
03:17:43.110 --> 03:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
duties i hear your question though
 
03:17:45.190 --> 03:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
you're asking what's the change and in
 
03:17:48.070 --> 03:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
fact the the challenge
 
03:17:50.630 --> 03:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
existed prior to the pandemic the
 
03:17:52.229 --> 03:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
ability of members of the public to
 
03:17:54.630 --> 03:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
participate in public bodies
 
03:17:56.630 --> 03:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
and or those
 
03:17:59.030 --> 03:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
members of the public who sought to take
 
03:17:59.040 --> 03:17:59.910 align:start position:0%
members of the public who sought to take
on

03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
roles as members of public bodies
 
03:18:05.110 --> 03:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
nurses were challenged prior to the
 
03:18:05.120 --> 03:18:06.389 align:start position:0%
nurses were challenged prior to the
pandemic

03:18:06.389 --> 03:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
03:18:08.070 --> 03:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
the older people were challenged prior
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic and there's been a
 
03:18:13.830 --> 03:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
desire for some time
 
03:18:16.469 --> 03:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
to make public bodies more accessible to
 
03:18:18.790 --> 03:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
those who had transportation
 
03:18:18.800 --> 03:18:20.630 align:start position:0%
those who had transportation
communication

03:18:20.630 --> 03:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
communication
 
03:18:21.830 --> 03:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
or time
 
03:18:21.840 --> 03:18:23.030 align:start position:0%
or time
constraints

03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
constraints
 
03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
has the council on aging taking
 
03:18:31.190 --> 03:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
advantage of the opportunities that
 
03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
exist within the current law for members
 
03:18:35.830 --> 03:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
to participate remotely
 
03:18:37.830 --> 03:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question um and
 
03:18:39.910 --> 03:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
just to clarify it's a commission on
 
03:18:39.920 --> 03:18:40.790 align:start position:0%
just to clarify it's a commission on
aging

03:18:40.790 --> 03:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
aging
 
03:18:42.389 --> 03:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that's okay
 
03:18:43.269 --> 03:18:43.279 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
03:18:45.429 --> 03:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
it's a common uh confusion
 
03:18:45.439 --> 03:18:46.710 align:start position:0%
it's a common uh confusion
um

03:18:46.710 --> 03:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:18:50.469 --> 03:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
the challenge is for that particular
 
03:18:50.479 --> 03:18:51.429 align:start position:0%
the challenge is for that particular
body

03:18:51.429 --> 03:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
body
 
03:18:54.790 --> 03:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
that there must be a quorum
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
physically present in a physical
 
03:18:59.190 --> 03:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
location in order to take actions
 
03:19:01.030 --> 03:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
so we've had
 
03:19:04.469 --> 03:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
40 to 60 individuals participating
 
03:19:06.389 --> 03:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
we had 11 people there in person
 
03:19:09.349 --> 03:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
everybody else was on zoom but they we
 
03:19:11.349 --> 03:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
we couldn't hold a vote and therefore we
 
03:19:13.750 --> 03:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't take actions to move forward on
 
03:19:15.590 --> 03:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
on particular recommendations that would
 
03:19:18.550 --> 03:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
come to you
 
03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:19.670 align:start position:0%
come to you
okay

03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:19:22.550 --> 03:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
there any other questions
 
03:19:24.070 --> 03:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:19:27.670 --> 03:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:29.520 align:start position:0%

probably every school meeting my school
 
03:20:06.150 --> 03:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
district has

uh in the last year i have probably done
 
03:20:16.630 --> 03:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
so many zooms personally i'm sick of
 
03:20:16.640 --> 03:20:18.469 align:start position:0%
so many zooms personally i'm sick of
them

03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
them

them
if

03:20:20.229 --> 03:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:20:23.910 --> 03:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
and this bill is much to be desired
 
03:20:26.070 --> 03:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
as far as let's say we had a zoom
 
03:20:26.080 --> 03:20:28.229 align:start position:0%
as far as let's say we had a zoom
meeting

03:20:28.229 --> 03:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
03:20:30.550 --> 03:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
there's people like me
 
03:20:33.030 --> 03:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
i do not do video
 
03:20:35.670 --> 03:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
so you have a zoom meeting
 
03:20:36.950 --> 03:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
of a committee
 
03:20:39.349 --> 03:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
or in your town
 
03:20:41.670 --> 03:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
and names come up you have no idea who's
 
03:20:46.150 --> 03:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire and it's true
 
03:20:48.479 --> 03:20:49.750 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire and it's true
everywhere

03:20:49.750 --> 03:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
03:20:53.830 --> 03:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
not everybody has access to computers
 
03:20:57.110 --> 03:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
not everybody has access
 
03:21:00.150 --> 03:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
and as far as technology goes
 
03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
there is much to be as desired
 
03:21:10.229 --> 03:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
in some areas and i'll give an example
 
03:21:12.630 --> 03:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
the other night i went to the merrimack
 
03:21:15.750 --> 03:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
valley public hearing
 
03:21:18.870 --> 03:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
i sat in a separate room all by myself
 
03:21:22.830 --> 03:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:26.309 --> 03:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
one the meeting started and i'm not one
 
03:21:29.429 --> 03:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
to make a lot of noise
 
03:21:32.469 --> 03:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
and they live stream it and i had a big
 
03:21:36.950 --> 03:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
tv in front of me except nothing worked
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
the option was
 
03:21:43.670 --> 03:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
i could go stand outside the doorway
 
03:21:45.030 --> 03:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
which i did
 
03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
so i could listen to the meeting but i'm
 
03:21:50.469 --> 03:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
and after a while they got it fixed and
 
03:21:55.990 --> 03:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:58.790 --> 03:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:00.710 --> 03:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
doing all these
 
03:22:03.429 --> 03:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
passing something like this
 
03:22:06.550 --> 03:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
people are lazy and i'm one of them it
 
03:22:09.110 --> 03:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
is easier for me to sit home and do a
 
03:22:12.309 --> 03:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting than it is to go someplace
 
03:22:12.319 --> 03:22:13.670 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting than it is to go someplace
sometimes

03:22:13.670 --> 03:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
03:22:15.830 --> 03:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
and be with everybody else and it's
 
03:22:15.840 --> 03:22:17.750 align:start position:0%
and be with everybody else and it's
wrong

03:22:17.750 --> 03:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
because i enjoy other people
 
03:22:23.830 --> 03:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's just we get into our little habits
 
03:22:23.840 --> 03:22:25.510 align:start position:0%
it's just we get into our little habits
and

03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:28.150 --> 03:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
there's so many also in this this bill
 
03:22:31.910 --> 03:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
03:22:38.070 --> 03:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
meetings go new hampshire was built
 
03:22:41.750 --> 03:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
on public meetings and public bodies and
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
when a person runs for an office
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
they know
 
03:22:48.630 --> 03:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
that they got to go to public meetings
 
03:22:48.640 --> 03:22:50.630 align:start position:0%
that they got to go to public meetings
and

03:22:50.630 --> 03:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:53.750 --> 03:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
to have zoom or a live stream
 
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
for people
 
03:22:57.830 --> 03:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
to sit home and they want to watch it
 
03:22:59.590 --> 03:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's one thing
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
but to have remote
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
meetings and we all just get on the
 
03:23:06.309 --> 03:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
phone or we all just get on zoom
 
03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
personally i'ma get it against it thank
 
03:23:08.880 --> 03:23:11.269 align:start position:0%
personally i'ma get it against it thank
you

03:23:11.269 --> 03:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:12.389 --> 03:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
03:23:12.399 --> 03:23:16.550 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
representative

03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:21.110 --> 03:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:28.389 --> 03:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:30.550 --> 03:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
i just have two more cards after that
 
03:23:32.389 --> 03:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
i've assumed that you'd want this since
 
03:23:33.750 --> 03:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
this is our last hearing you'd like to
 
03:23:35.349 --> 03:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
finish this hearing rather than break
 
03:23:37.670 --> 03:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
and come back after lunch and
 
03:23:40.150 --> 03:23:40.160 align:start position:0%

03:23:40.160 --> 03:23:41.510 align:start position:0%
is that correct

03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:56.160 align:start position:0%

for them too and i'm here for the town
 
03:24:05.910 --> 03:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
of peterborough trustees i had a meeting
 
03:24:09.590 --> 03:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
there this morning uh in person gorham
 
03:24:12.150 --> 03:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm here for them uh as well and a
 
03:24:13.990 --> 03:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
couple of things i'd like to just talk
 
03:24:15.750 --> 03:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
about just for a few minutes uh the
 
03:24:17.510 --> 03:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
first is you know in listening to
 
03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
testimony it it's pretty clear that
 
03:24:23.990 --> 03:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's almost a disconnect
 
03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:25.190 align:start position:0%
there's almost a disconnect
because

03:24:25.190 --> 03:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:24:26.790 --> 03:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
public bodies in the state of new
 
03:24:28.550 --> 03:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire include
 
03:24:31.590 --> 03:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
this august group and elected officials
 
03:24:33.510 --> 03:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
but they also include like i just
 
03:24:34.710 --> 03:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
03:24:36.309 --> 03:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
other bodies as well the southwest
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
region planning commission the trustees
 
03:24:40.389 --> 03:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
we have an airport advisory commission
 
03:24:42.389 --> 03:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
all the way to the zoning board we have
 
03:24:44.070 --> 03:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
about 200 people
 
03:24:45.830 --> 03:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
that sit on these various boards and
 
03:24:47.910 --> 03:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
commissions they're all volunteers
 
03:24:50.790 --> 03:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh and uh unfortunately many of them and
 
03:24:52.469 --> 03:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
i'm starting to be in that category have
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
the color hair that i have you know we
 
03:24:56.550 --> 03:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people who when they
 
03:24:58.389 --> 03:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
retire or otherwise because they are
 
03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
able to do it
 
03:25:02.790 --> 03:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
basically run the city you know they run
 
03:25:05.429 --> 03:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
all of these boards and commissions
 
03:25:07.750 --> 03:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
and what this bill is attempting to do
 
03:25:09.510 --> 03:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to tell you that it
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't be improved i think it could be
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
improved some but what it's attempting
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
to do really is to recognize that we
 
03:25:19.110 --> 03:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
have these folks out there
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
and that they really do need us to
 
03:25:22.319 --> 03:25:23.750 align:start position:0%
and that they really do need us to
accommodate

03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
03:25:26.389 --> 03:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
their abilities to participate in
 
03:25:28.309 --> 03:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
government you know we talk about
 
03:25:28.319 --> 03:25:30.070 align:start position:0%
government you know we talk about
transparency

03:25:30.070 --> 03:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
03:25:31.990 --> 03:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think we had far more transparency in
 
03:25:33.990 --> 03:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of ways when we did this during
 
03:25:36.309 --> 03:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
the pandemic we were able to ramp this
 
03:25:38.469 --> 03:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
program up uh not i'm not going to tell
 
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
you seamlessly anybody who started this
 
03:25:42.389 --> 03:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
knew at the very beginning that there
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
were issues and problems we were able to
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
overcome all of those problems
 
03:25:48.550 --> 03:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
we did it both electronically and we did
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
it by telephone uh the executive order
 
03:25:53.590 --> 03:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
emergency order that came out made no
 
03:25:55.110 --> 03:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
reference at all to the telephone
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
contact we recognized that we shouldn't
 
03:25:59.190 --> 03:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
be charging people
 
03:26:01.349 --> 03:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
to attend by telephone so the city of
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
keene implemented an 800 number for
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
people to call because it's true not
 
03:26:09.190 --> 03:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
everybody uh has a you know
 
03:26:12.790 --> 03:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
costless phone program so we did that we
 
03:26:15.429 --> 03:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
were able to put the zoom capability
 
03:26:17.429 --> 03:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
into place you know and keeping in mind
 
03:26:19.349 --> 03:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
that this bill just provides for that it
 
03:26:20.950 --> 03:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that you have to do that but
 
03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
we were able to do that
 
03:26:24.950 --> 03:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh were there people who participated
 
03:26:28.150 --> 03:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
from timbuktu yes there were
 
03:26:30.550 --> 03:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
and you know we just sort of had to deal
 
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
with that but most people that
 
03:26:32.640 --> 03:26:34.070 align:start position:0%
with that but most people that
participated

03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
participated
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
were from the local community and really
 
03:26:37.990 --> 03:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
appreciated the opportunity
 
03:26:39.910 --> 03:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
to have that
 
03:26:42.309 --> 03:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
to have that opportunity in order to
 
03:26:42.319 --> 03:26:43.670 align:start position:0%
to have that opportunity in order to
participate

03:26:43.670 --> 03:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
participate
 
03:26:43.680 --> 03:26:44.630 align:start position:0%
participate
um

03:26:44.630 --> 03:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:46.630 --> 03:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of uh
 
03:26:48.870 --> 03:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know the idea of elected versus
 
03:26:51.030 --> 03:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
appointed officials i think elected
 
03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
bodies really need to consider carefully
 
03:26:55.429 --> 03:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh if they're going to even implement
 
03:26:57.670 --> 03:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
this possibility but remembering it is
 
03:26:59.750 --> 03:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
that a possibility it's not something
 
03:27:02.550 --> 03:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
that they have to do at this point
 
03:27:04.389 --> 03:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
my members of the library board of
 
03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
trustees quite recently because we as
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
many of you know there was a fairly big
 
03:27:10.150 --> 03:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
spike over in cheshire county and in the
 
03:27:11.429 --> 03:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
keene area
 
03:27:13.190 --> 03:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
they were all very nervous
 
03:27:14.790 --> 03:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
about coming together
 
03:27:17.030 --> 03:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
in a quorum in one room
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
and approached me with this question
 
03:27:20.950 --> 03:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
there was a possibility circulating out
 
03:27:21.830 --> 03:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:27:23.590 --> 03:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
in the world about using the emergency
 
03:27:26.229 --> 03:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
provision under the existing statute
 
03:27:28.550 --> 03:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
to have a meeting uh and
 
03:27:30.710 --> 03:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know my opinion basically was i'm
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
not sure it's to be used for that
 
03:27:34.630 --> 03:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
purpose uh but
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
that's the level of anxiety that really
 
03:27:41.349 --> 03:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
exists uh in many of our uh communities
 
03:27:44.229 --> 03:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
so i would very much encourage you
 
03:27:46.389 --> 03:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
on behalf of all of these others to at
 
03:27:49.190 --> 03:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
least consider this possibility
 
03:27:50.950 --> 03:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
i have to tell you i would be in favor
 
03:27:52.469 --> 03:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
of having a physical location
 
03:27:55.590 --> 03:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
requirement at least for individuals who
 
03:27:58.550 --> 03:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
want to be able to attend who can't for
 
03:28:01.190 --> 03:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
whatever reason attend by zoom or attend
 
03:28:03.510 --> 03:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
by telephone or just like to go out i
 
03:28:05.830 --> 03:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
mean we have that possibility so i mean
 
03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
that would be something that i would
 
03:28:09.110 --> 03:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
encourage you to do
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
i would also encourage you that if the
 
03:28:13.269 --> 03:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
phone uh if the phone
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
aspect was to be included to make
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
specific uh requirement uh that it be
 
03:28:20.070 --> 03:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
done either through an 800 number or
 
03:28:21.429 --> 03:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
without charge
 
03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have that controversy
 
03:28:25.670 --> 03:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
in the future but please consider this i
 
03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
think it's in the interest of the of the
 
03:28:29.190 --> 03:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
state to do that
 
03:28:31.269 --> 03:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions questions for mr
 
03:28:31.279 --> 03:28:33.030 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions questions for mr
mullen

03:28:33.030 --> 03:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
mullen
 
03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative chase first
 
03:28:38.550 --> 03:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
03:28:40.950 --> 03:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm really curious
 
03:28:43.030 --> 03:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
about the 800 numbers this is the first
 
03:28:44.790 --> 03:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
time i've heard it is it something the
 
03:28:47.830 --> 03:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
town set up and anyone can use it
 
03:28:50.229 --> 03:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
could you explain that to me please yes
 
03:28:52.550 --> 03:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
well in a nutshell yes
 
03:28:54.790 --> 03:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
the town set up the city set up through
 
03:28:57.830 --> 03:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office uh an 800 number uh
 
03:28:59.670 --> 03:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
that was able to be used
 
03:29:01.030 --> 03:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
by all of the boards and commissions
 
03:29:05.110 --> 03:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:06.710 --> 03:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
i'm just quick
 
03:29:08.790 --> 03:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
not familiar again with 800 numbers so
 
03:29:08.800 --> 03:29:10.070 align:start position:0%
not familiar again with 800 numbers so
um

03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:12.150 --> 03:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
many people can call in at one time on
 
03:29:15.670 --> 03:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
an 800 number and or is there a capacity
 
03:29:18.550 --> 03:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
yes actually uh we we had a phone tree
 
03:29:21.030 --> 03:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
set up so that uh when people called in
 
03:29:22.389 --> 03:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
it was just like when you called into a
 
03:29:23.750 --> 03:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
talk show
 
03:29:24.790 --> 03:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
03:29:27.190 --> 03:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know they put you into the queue uh
 
03:29:29.030 --> 03:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then you got called out of the queue
 
03:29:31.269 --> 03:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
for that purpose
 
03:29:33.590 --> 03:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan um well first of
 
03:29:35.590 --> 03:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
all anecdotally i know an elected
 
03:29:37.670 --> 03:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
official who endeavor upgraded her home
 
03:29:39.269 --> 03:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
phone plan
 
03:29:40.950 --> 03:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
um to have unlimited long distance
 
03:29:43.030 --> 03:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
calling and she uh i think she had to
 
03:29:45.269 --> 03:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
get it forgiven by uh whatever the
 
03:29:47.190 --> 03:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
successor of verizon is i've lost track
 
03:29:49.670 --> 03:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
of their name but uh so that is a real
 
03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
problem for some people what i was going
 
03:29:52.229 --> 03:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
03:29:54.309 --> 03:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
what i raised my hand to ask about is
 
03:29:55.510 --> 03:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
i know
 
03:29:57.510 --> 03:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
at least one public body in my area
 
03:29:59.670 --> 03:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
which was locked out of its facility
 
03:30:01.349 --> 03:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
because the
 
03:30:02.950 --> 03:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
organization whose meeting room they've
 
03:30:05.429 --> 03:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
been borrowed
 
03:30:07.190 --> 03:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
decided to keep his meeting room close
 
03:30:09.190 --> 03:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
to the public after the governor rather
 
03:30:11.349 --> 03:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
abruptly lifted the emergency order so
 
03:30:13.030 --> 03:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
that was that an isolated incident or
 
03:30:15.030 --> 03:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
have you heard of other cases like that
 
03:30:18.469 --> 03:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
of public bodies which
 
03:30:20.150 --> 03:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
can't physically meet in their own
 
03:30:21.429 --> 03:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
location because it's no longer
 
03:30:25.110 --> 03:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:26.630 --> 03:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
that's actually more of a complicated
 
03:30:28.790 --> 03:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
question than you would think
 
03:30:32.630 --> 03:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
we did not but we had to scramble and
 
03:30:34.950 --> 03:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
and we still do to some extent to be
 
03:30:36.950 --> 03:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
able to find locations that would
 
03:30:38.550 --> 03:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
satisfy the social distancing
 
03:30:41.030 --> 03:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
requirements you know that we operate
 
03:30:43.830 --> 03:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
under uh and that limited again the
 
03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
ability of the public to come into the
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
meetings that was especially true in the
 
03:30:49.590 --> 03:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
city council we have a 15-member city
 
03:30:51.750 --> 03:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
council uh plus we have the staff that
 
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
have to attend myself the city manager
 
03:30:54.790 --> 03:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
the city clerk
 
03:30:56.790 --> 03:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
so once you start putting them into a
 
03:30:58.150 --> 03:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
room that's
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
not much different than this
 
03:31:02.309 --> 03:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
as you know it starts to become a
 
03:31:04.389 --> 03:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
problem in order to be even able to
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
allow the public uh at that point to
 
03:31:08.469 --> 03:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
come in so we had to make remote uh
 
03:31:10.710 --> 03:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities available uh even when we
 
03:31:14.309 --> 03:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions for
 
03:31:18.950 --> 03:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:23.750 --> 03:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:41.110 --> 03:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:43.429 --> 03:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:31:45.269 --> 03:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
my name is lori ordolano i live in
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
nashua i'm vice president for new
 
03:31:49.349 --> 03:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire right to know
 
03:31:50.950 --> 03:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire right to know is
 
03:31:53.670 --> 03:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill with amended
 
03:31:55.990 --> 03:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
language and it's pretty amended from
 
03:31:58.229 --> 03:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
the standpoint that we feel very
 
03:32:00.150 --> 03:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
strongly that a physical location must
 
03:32:02.229 --> 03:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
be maintained
 
03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
we like the hybrid meeting approach for
 
03:32:07.030 --> 03:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
public access and we believe there's
 
03:32:09.590 --> 03:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
been a significant increase in public
 
03:32:14.550 --> 03:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
and we believe this is a good thing
 
03:32:20.830 --> 03:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
we would like to see this continue this
 
03:32:23.670 --> 03:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
accessibility but we feel the physical
 
03:32:26.950 --> 03:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
location should not be eliminated and we
 
03:32:29.670 --> 03:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
feel the physical location
 
03:32:29.680 --> 03:32:32.070 align:start position:0%
feel the physical location
um

03:32:32.070 --> 03:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:33.990 --> 03:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
is important enough that the language
 
03:32:36.630 --> 03:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
that was struck in a of the bill
 
03:32:38.950 --> 03:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
we have unstruck it and we would like
 
03:32:38.960 --> 03:32:40.469 align:start position:0%
we have unstruck it and we would like
attendance

03:32:40.469 --> 03:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
03:32:44.070 --> 03:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
to be required and if you can't be there
 
03:32:46.550 --> 03:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
you have to have an explanation as to
 
03:32:49.190 --> 03:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
why reasonably you can't attend for
 
03:32:50.950 --> 03:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
those people who are serving in an
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
elected or appointed position
 
03:32:53.040 --> 03:32:55.510 align:start position:0%
elected or appointed position
um

03:32:55.510 --> 03:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:58.309 --> 03:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
eliminating a physical location assumes
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
that interested citizens have access
 
03:33:01.910 --> 03:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
with the technology and we know that's
 
03:33:04.469 --> 03:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
not always the case and the telephonic
 
03:33:06.790 --> 03:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
only means of communicating can be
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
problematic and i agree with the cost
 
03:33:11.910 --> 03:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
issue that's been pointed out here and
 
03:33:13.510 --> 03:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
the connectivity issues that are
 
03:33:16.150 --> 03:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
appointed uh
 
03:33:19.349 --> 03:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
afforded with both um audio and visual
 
03:33:19.359 --> 03:33:20.790 align:start position:0%
afforded with both um audio and visual
capabilities

03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
capabilities
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the face-to-face interpersonal
 
03:33:26.070 --> 03:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
contact and the verbal and non-verbal
 
03:33:27.990 --> 03:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
cueing you get
 
03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
when you have a physical location of
 
03:33:32.389 --> 03:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
your elected people is
 
03:33:34.469 --> 03:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
very important in understanding what's
 
03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
happening in a meeting
 
03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you just recently i went
 
03:33:39.670 --> 03:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
to a meeting physically
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
and i watched my board and one of my
 
03:33:44.550 --> 03:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
board members really winced at something
 
03:33:47.429 --> 03:33:47.439 align:start position:0%
that was said in the meeting that also
 
03:33:49.670 --> 03:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
made me wince and when the meeting ended
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
i went up to that board member and i
 
03:33:51.840 --> 03:33:53.190 align:start position:0%
i went up to that board member and i
said

03:33:53.190 --> 03:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:33:55.830 --> 03:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
you looked uncomfortable with this
 
03:33:57.910 --> 03:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
statement and i'm concerned about it as
 
03:34:00.469 --> 03:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
well and they acknowledged that yes this
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
was a problem and here's the issue that
 
03:34:05.670 --> 03:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
would never get recorded in the minutes
 
03:34:07.030 --> 03:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
that body language wouldn't be
 
03:34:09.990 --> 03:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
documented but i was able to
 
03:34:13.750 --> 03:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
see it by being there and know that
 
03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
something wasn't quite right
 
03:34:18.550 --> 03:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
i attached for you the final report done
 
03:34:20.389 --> 03:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
by the committee to review authorizing
 
03:34:22.710 --> 03:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
governing bodies of municipalities to
 
03:34:24.870 --> 03:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
hold virtual meetings that was finalized
 
03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
november 1st of 2021 and representative
 
03:34:30.469 --> 03:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
wolper did that report with a group of
 
03:34:32.710 --> 03:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
individuals and all right to know new
 
03:34:34.870 --> 03:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire thinks that was well done and
 
03:34:37.030 --> 03:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of good points in there
 
03:34:39.269 --> 03:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
on how to incorporate a virtual the
 
03:34:41.590 --> 03:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
virtual aspects of a meeting
 
03:34:45.429 --> 03:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
into our public process so we adopted a
 
03:34:47.590 --> 03:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
lot of our positions from this
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
memorandum in work that was done by
 
03:34:50.160 --> 03:34:51.190 align:start position:0%
memorandum in work that was done by
committee

03:34:51.190 --> 03:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:53.510 align:start position:0%
committee
and

03:34:53.510 --> 03:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
you know i can tell you
 
03:34:57.429 --> 03:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
we have been using so nash was a pretty
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
big city and we have access to a lot of
 
03:35:01.190 --> 03:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
technology we have a public tv station
 
03:35:03.190 --> 03:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
that the meetings run on we've been able
 
03:35:05.190 --> 03:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
to have a zoom feature for board of
 
03:35:07.750 --> 03:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
aldermen meetings but shockingly there's
 
03:35:09.670 --> 03:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
no zoom connection for school board
 
03:35:09.680 --> 03:35:12.229 align:start position:0%
no zoom connection for school board
meetings

03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:14.150 --> 03:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
but when our elected officials those
 
03:35:17.830 --> 03:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
that are uh choosing to stay on zoom
 
03:35:19.750 --> 03:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
the one thing i don't like is they won't
 
03:35:20.870 --> 03:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
run their
 
03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
video they keep their screens dark their
 
03:35:27.349 --> 03:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
video off and only their name appears on
 
03:35:29.590 --> 03:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
the screen you know i really want to see
 
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
my elected officials and i know in some
 
03:35:35.750 --> 03:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
instances i feel the remote location is
 
03:35:38.389 --> 03:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
too relaxed for the elected body and
 
03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
those who should be in front of their
 
03:35:40.880 --> 03:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
those who should be in front of their
public

03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:35:43.590 --> 03:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
there have been instances where members
 
03:35:45.830 --> 03:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
of our board are on social media posting
 
03:35:48.790 --> 03:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
live while the meeting is going on and i
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
personally feel that should be happening
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
but they're afforded that or they're
 
03:35:54.710 --> 03:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing that because they're
 
03:35:58.150 --> 03:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:01.349 --> 03:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
so we took the bill and attached on page
 
03:36:04.630 --> 03:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
two is our rendition of it and destruct
 
03:36:06.389 --> 03:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
language in a we
 
03:36:08.070 --> 03:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
unstruck and we believe it should be
 
03:36:11.670 --> 03:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
there b we believed it should be there
 
03:36:13.830 --> 03:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
um the physical location not being
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
required we said no to that um public
 
03:36:19.030 --> 03:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
noticing of all uh meetings should be
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
done and taking pages right out of the
 
03:36:25.190 --> 03:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
report that was done by representative
 
03:36:25.200 --> 03:36:26.630 align:start position:0%
report that was done by representative
wolper

03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
wolper
 
03:36:28.950 --> 03:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
you have to provide a posting that tells
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
the public body how to access the
 
03:36:32.550 --> 03:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
meeting and if
 
03:36:34.309 --> 03:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
if they aren't able to access provide a
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
contact number and adjourn the meeting
 
03:36:36.960 --> 03:36:38.309 align:start position:0%
contact number and adjourn the meeting
um

03:36:38.309 --> 03:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:40.710 --> 03:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
and we agreed with language each member
 
03:36:42.150 --> 03:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill that spoke
 
03:36:43.750 --> 03:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
about each member participating
 
03:36:46.070 --> 03:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
electronically in a meeting required to
 
03:36:49.110 --> 03:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
be open it that it needs to be heard and
 
03:36:50.790 --> 03:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
the speaking needs to be
 
03:36:53.590 --> 03:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
identifiable to not the public and the
 
03:36:56.229 --> 03:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
members itself
 
03:36:58.790 --> 03:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing we added is g which came
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
i believe out of the report when
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
community input is accepted members of
 
03:37:05.990 --> 03:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
the public in attendance at the physical
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
location will be given priority over
 
03:37:11.190 --> 03:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
remote participation participation
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
this is what we've been doing in nashua
 
03:37:15.269 --> 03:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
anyone who comes to the chamber is
 
03:37:17.429 --> 03:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
called to the microphone who's because
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
they actually sign up in the chamber so
 
03:37:22.309 --> 03:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
the um board president calls them to the
 
03:37:22.319 --> 03:37:23.510 align:start position:0%
the um board president calls them to the
microphone

03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
03:37:25.349 --> 03:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:37:27.269 --> 03:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
then they go through the
 
03:37:29.670 --> 03:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
video folks
 
03:37:31.910 --> 03:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
who can raise their hand and and phone
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
is complicated because you don't have a
 
03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
hand raising mechanism
 
03:37:38.469 --> 03:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
so those people are left to shout in at
 
03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
the end i want to speak
 
03:37:42.309 --> 03:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
and and then they get recognized because
 
03:37:46.950 --> 03:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:50.070 --> 03:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
so i just feel it's very important i did
 
03:37:52.710 --> 03:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
a court case and i will tell you
 
03:37:55.990 --> 03:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
working on a right to know court case
 
03:37:57.990 --> 03:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
was a nightmare i got caught in the
 
03:37:59.910 --> 03:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic the priority
 
03:38:02.950 --> 03:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
um process was completely wiped out i
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
had 10 telephonic hearings with the
 
03:38:07.269 --> 03:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
court i thought they would be videoed
 
03:38:09.429 --> 03:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
but they were telephonic and they were
 
03:38:12.150 --> 03:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
truly the worst experience i never got
 
03:38:13.429 --> 03:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
to see the judge i didn't know what the
 
03:38:15.910 --> 03:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
judge looked like for 10 months
 
03:38:17.590 --> 03:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
he was oz
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
and you know i had no idea what was
 
03:38:20.469 --> 03:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
going on
 
03:38:22.870 --> 03:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
and um there were no questions being
 
03:38:24.830 --> 03:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
asked everyone seemed
 
03:38:28.150 --> 03:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
disengaged disconnected and i thought my
 
03:38:31.110 --> 03:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
case did horribly in that format and
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
once i got into court and had a
 
03:38:34.309 --> 03:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
face-to-face meeting
 
03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
in the court my case became so much
 
03:38:37.359 --> 03:38:38.309 align:start position:0%
in the court my case became so much
better

03:38:38.309 --> 03:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:38:38.319 --> 03:38:39.269 align:start position:0%
better
so

03:38:39.269 --> 03:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:38:39.279 --> 03:38:40.790 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:38:40.790 --> 03:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:43.990 --> 03:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'm really hesitant to back this virtual
 
03:38:46.870 --> 03:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
mode for elected people really love the
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
physical location and love being out
 
03:38:51.189 --> 03:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
there and our our committee really
 
03:38:53.110 --> 03:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
believes and feels strongly that that
 
03:38:56.950 --> 03:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:01.269 --> 03:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
yes i don't know what's in her
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative whelper the chairman so
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
well first of all
 
03:39:07.990 --> 03:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
we had several copies they didn't make
 
03:39:09.910 --> 03:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
it all around the table but more
 
03:39:11.670 --> 03:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
general question is
 
03:39:13.990 --> 03:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
where do we find
 
03:39:16.630 --> 03:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
this memorandum uh online or the
 
03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
memorandum of other final reports of
 
03:39:18.800 --> 03:39:20.469 align:start position:0%
memorandum of other final reports of
committees

03:39:20.469 --> 03:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
committees
 
03:39:21.830 --> 03:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative wolfers since you
 
03:39:23.990 --> 03:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
authored that i think can you explain
 
03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:25.429 align:start position:0%
authored that i think can you explain
that

03:39:25.429 --> 03:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:27.269 --> 03:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding that it's on
 
03:39:29.269 --> 03:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
the general court website if you you can
 
03:39:31.429 --> 03:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
look for study committees uh separately
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
from the way you look for bills but it's
 
03:39:36.630 --> 03:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's an advanced search uh if you
 
03:39:38.790 --> 03:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
really want one i have electronic copies
 
03:39:40.150 --> 03:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
and you can certainly have a couple of
 
03:39:41.750 --> 03:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
the copies that are floating around here
 
03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
anyway but i got an extra one available
 
03:39:46.150 --> 03:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
off the office general court website you
 
03:39:49.349 --> 03:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:52.710 --> 03:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:55.030 --> 03:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you testimony today the
 
03:39:57.030 --> 03:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
last card i have
 
03:39:57.040 --> 03:39:57.990 align:start position:0%
last card i have
is

03:39:57.990 --> 03:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:40:07.590 --> 03:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:10.309 --> 03:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
good afternoon at this point committee
 
03:40:11.590 --> 03:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
nate grays for the new hampshire
 
03:40:15.110 --> 03:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
municipal association we support uh hb
 
03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
1014 as written
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
i haven't had the opportunity to review
 
03:40:20.160 --> 03:40:20.950 align:start position:0%
i haven't had the opportunity to review
the

03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:40:24.469 --> 03:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed by uh
 
03:40:26.469 --> 03:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire right to know but
 
03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
from the description it does not appear
 
03:40:33.030 --> 03:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
really what this bill is trying to do is
 
03:40:37.349 --> 03:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
address two
 
03:40:39.429 --> 03:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
intertwined issues
 
03:40:41.990 --> 03:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:40:43.269 --> 03:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
it's really intertwined because it's
 
03:40:45.429 --> 03:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
really about the functioning of
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
the body itself and the issue that were
 
03:40:50.790 --> 03:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
that we are hoping will be targeted
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
through any amendment is the quorum
 
03:40:55.590 --> 03:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
requirement and that's really the issue
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
is boards are really struggling with
 
03:41:00.070 --> 03:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
getting a quorum out of physical
 
03:41:03.030 --> 03:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
location i've heard proposed today from
 
03:41:04.630 --> 03:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
several witnesses that they would like
 
03:41:07.189 --> 03:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would require a board
 
03:41:09.189 --> 03:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
to still have a physical location that
 
03:41:10.950 --> 03:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
the public could come to
 
03:41:10.960 --> 03:41:12.630 align:start position:0%
the public could come to
attend

03:41:12.630 --> 03:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
attend
 
03:41:14.790 --> 03:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
provide comment as necessary
 
03:41:14.800 --> 03:41:15.670 align:start position:0%
provide comment as necessary
um

03:41:15.670 --> 03:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:17.830 --> 03:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
and that's not something we would object
 
03:41:21.030 --> 03:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
to i think most municipalities would be
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine with that um even under
 
03:41:27.269 --> 03:41:27.279 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
and i know to a large extent even with
 
03:41:30.479 --> 03:41:31.750 align:start position:0%
and i know to a large extent even with
covid

03:41:31.750 --> 03:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
covid
 
03:41:31.760 --> 03:41:32.750 align:start position:0%
covid
uh

03:41:32.750 --> 03:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:41:35.349 --> 03:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities were trying to figure out
 
03:41:37.030 --> 03:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
how to accommodate the public and
 
03:41:39.429 --> 03:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
provide as much access as possible and
 
03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
many of them did set up large rooms with
 
03:41:45.750 --> 03:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
video screens and everything else
 
03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
social distancing to try to make sure
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
the public could continue to attend
 
03:41:49.840 --> 03:41:51.189 align:start position:0%
the public could continue to attend
those

03:41:51.189 --> 03:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:41:51.199 --> 03:41:52.150 align:start position:0%
those
those

03:41:52.150 --> 03:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:41:55.269 --> 03:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
board meetings and body meetings
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
so we would not have any sort of
 
03:41:59.349 --> 03:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
objection to still requiring a physical
 
03:41:59.359 --> 03:42:00.469 align:start position:0%
objection to still requiring a physical
location

03:42:00.469 --> 03:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
location
 
03:42:02.469 --> 03:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
really what we're hoping gets
 
03:42:04.870 --> 03:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
relaxed is that quorum requirement at
 
03:42:06.070 --> 03:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
the physical
 
03:42:08.830 --> 03:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
location i'm happy to take
 
03:42:11.269 --> 03:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
questions any questions
 
03:42:14.309 --> 03:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative chase
 
03:42:15.269 --> 03:42:15.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:42:19.269 --> 03:42:19.279 align:start position:0%
i was obviously concerned about the
 
03:42:21.670 --> 03:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
quorum as well i really like everything
 
03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
about this but my question to you would
 
03:42:26.070 --> 03:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
be how can that be done
 
03:42:28.150 --> 03:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
isn't that kind of a written is it a
 
03:42:30.389 --> 03:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
robert's rule or what
 
03:42:32.630 --> 03:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
having a having a quorum
 
03:42:32.640 --> 03:42:33.670 align:start position:0%
having a having a quorum
how

03:42:33.670 --> 03:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure but i can explain the laws
 
03:42:46.469 --> 03:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
written now and what's required so so a
 
03:42:49.750 --> 03:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
board can only act if it has a quorum
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
present and a quorum by default
 
03:42:54.469 --> 03:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
would have would be a majority
 
03:42:54.479 --> 03:42:56.469 align:start position:0%
would have would be a majority
um

03:42:56.469 --> 03:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:58.630 --> 03:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
there's no ability under the right to
 
03:43:00.309 --> 03:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
know law and it specifically addresses
 
03:43:02.790 --> 03:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
the idea of reassigning a quorum to be
 
03:43:04.790 --> 03:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
less than a majority and you can't do
 
03:43:06.790 --> 03:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
that so you have to have a majority of
 
03:43:09.670 --> 03:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
the members physically present
 
03:43:09.680 --> 03:43:10.870 align:start position:0%
the members physically present
so

03:43:10.870 --> 03:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:13.750 --> 03:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
as written the law says accept in an
 
03:43:13.760 --> 03:43:15.590 align:start position:0%
as written the law says accept in an
emergency

03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
03:43:17.590 --> 03:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
basically a majority have to be at the
 
03:43:20.309 --> 03:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
physical location and so an emergency
 
03:43:22.630 --> 03:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
has a definition under the statute
 
03:43:24.790 --> 03:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
and the definition is something that
 
03:43:27.269 --> 03:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
requires immediate and undelayed action
 
03:43:29.590 --> 03:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
so think of something like the july
 
03:43:31.670 --> 03:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
rainstorms that washed out main street
 
03:43:34.150 --> 03:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
for some municipalities in the southwest
 
03:43:35.830 --> 03:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
obviously their select boards need to
 
03:43:38.309 --> 03:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
meet as soon as possible to get the ball
 
03:43:41.670 --> 03:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
rolling on putting up signs and you know
 
03:43:43.510 --> 03:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
preventing people from getting hurt
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
that's an emergency that's clearly an
 
03:43:45.279 --> 03:43:46.469 align:start position:0%
that's an emergency that's clearly an
emergency

03:43:46.469 --> 03:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
um you know if
 
03:43:49.990 --> 03:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know one select board members in
 
03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:51.030 align:start position:0%
you know one select board members in
florida

03:43:51.030 --> 03:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
florida
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
one's on one side of the washout one's
 
03:43:55.429 --> 03:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
on the other they can't physically meet
 
03:43:57.110 --> 03:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
with a quorum because you're gonna have
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
to have two in the room
 
03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
and that's just physically not possible
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
so that's what exists now under the law
 
03:44:07.269 --> 03:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
the problem that we're seeing is you
 
03:44:10.389 --> 03:44:10.399 align:start position:0%
have situations where you have
 
03:44:12.229 --> 03:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
things other than emergencies so
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
something like a planning board is
 
03:44:17.349 --> 03:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
required to meet once a month by statute
 
03:44:17.359 --> 03:44:18.469 align:start position:0%
required to meet once a month by statute
and

03:44:18.469 --> 03:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:20.550 --> 03:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
they simply can't because they can't get
 
03:44:22.070 --> 03:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
a majority of the body in the room
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
together but they'll have people who are
 
03:44:27.189 --> 03:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
you know they work in boston they can
 
03:44:29.510 --> 03:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
take an hour off work and call in
 
03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever the case may be so you could
 
03:44:31.920 --> 03:44:32.790 align:start position:0%
or whatever the case may be so you could
get

03:44:32.790 --> 03:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:44:35.189 --> 03:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
you know a substantial number of people
 
03:44:37.750 --> 03:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
in the room as you've heard um
 
03:44:39.910 --> 03:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:44:41.670 --> 03:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
but you might not be able to get that
 
03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
that majority in the room and that's
 
03:44:48.070 --> 03:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:51.269 --> 03:44:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:53.030 --> 03:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:44:55.349 --> 03:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
today is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:45:02.469 --> 03:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:06.790 --> 03:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:07.990 --> 03:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
yeah you need to might use the
 
03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:09.750 align:start position:0%
yeah you need to might use the
microphone

03:45:09.750 --> 03:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if i could
 
03:45:13.590 --> 03:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
say that it looks like there will be
 
03:45:16.070 --> 03:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
some kind of amendment coming
 
03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:45:22.070 --> 03:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:22.080 --> 03:45:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:45:22.870 --> 03:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:45:24.550 --> 03:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
with that we'll close the hearing on
 
03:45:27.750 --> 03:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 1014
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
and i believe
 
03:45:31.830 --> 03:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
no i think we're done for the day aren't
 
03:45:31.840 --> 03:45:33.429 align:start position:0%
no i think we're done for the day aren't
we
