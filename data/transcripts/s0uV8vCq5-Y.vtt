00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
trying to finalize the sub groups do you
 
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
have any of that information handy with
 
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
you if you could bring
 
00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 align:start position:0%
bring that up because not everybody has
 
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
gotten back to us as to which of these
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
subgroups they want to be part of and
 
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get that buttoned up in the
 
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 align:start position:0%
next few weeks
 
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 align:start position:0%
these groups I would like to work
 
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
on their own it is public so it'll have
 
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
to be noticed but I want to make up the
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
final appointment of who and who will be
 
00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 align:start position:0%
uh spearheading that who is the
 
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chair and things like that
 
00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
so we can all start working along and
 
00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
while I'm saying that
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
um when people have asked me when do I
 
00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
hope to get done
 
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
and the answer is when we have good work
 
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.589 align:start position:0%
and the answer is when we have good work
product

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
the deadline for this committee to
 
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
Sunset is next year
 
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 align:start position:0%
um probably October
 
00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 align:start position:0%
uh I don't want to rush things
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
if it's worth doing it's worth doing
 
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.930 align:start position:0%
if it's worth doing it's worth doing
right

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
some of the topics should be very quick
 
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
should be pretty obvious there seems to
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
be a consensus building others are going
 
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
to take a lot longer
 
00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 align:start position:0%
some of the work products will simply be
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
communicated to the Judiciary it will
 
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
not go into a bill I've been saying this
 
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
from day one I just want to say it again
 
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 align:start position:0%
already on the subject of
 
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
entry education for new judges and
 
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
continuing education the
 
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
chief justice invited me up to the law
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
library last week he gave me a library
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
card that frightens me because it's 10
 
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
cents a day if your book is late in
 
00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 align:start position:0%
Hampstead I don't know what it would be
 
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
if you stiff the Supreme Court's Library
 
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm I don't know but anyway he uh he
 
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
said you know that suggestion that has
 
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
been being talked about we're starting
 
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
to talk about it up here too
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
and I said well great let's uh let's
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
share but I think the fact is some of
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
the things that are not terribly
 
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
I had asked and I thank
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
several of you I know numbers of you
 
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
have extended email networks on the
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
subject of the court and I uh tried to
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
encourage you to tell your network that
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
what we will be doing today is actually
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
what committees normally do and that is
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
to hear people who have not testified
 
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.770 align:start position:0%
to hear people who have not testified
before

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
I have been very lacks in that we've
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
actually had a few people testifying two
 
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
three and even four times and you did
 
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
because I let you and I think getting
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
going it was probably okay but I asked
 
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
for people who are not on the list of
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
those who had previous testified and
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
that's all I have here uh these pink
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
cards fit what I've asked so let me just
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
repeat kind of what we need from you to
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
give us the useful information that will
 
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
help us as we make suggestions to the
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
courts and as we write bills for the
 
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
legislature we hope to enact into law
 
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.170 align:start position:0%
legislature we hope to enact into law
um

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
we need to know
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
those areas where in your experience
 
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.969 align:start position:0%
those areas where in your experience
either

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
the system wasn't followed here are the
 
00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 align:start position:0%
rules but they weren't followed
 
00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 align:start position:0%
or the rules were followed but you kind
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
of think maybe the rules should be
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
changed what we don't need don't accept
 
00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:17.539 align:start position:0%
is accusations against specific judges
 
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 align:start position:0%
oh he's just a crook oh he only or oh
 
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
she is on the take or what we we will
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
not accept that or about the Judiciary
 
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
in general
 
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
neither will we retry your case so
 
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
please do not give us all the specifics
 
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
of the case because that's not useful
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
information to us we just want to know
 
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
where there was a hiccup along the way
 
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.969 align:start position:0%
where there was a hiccup along the way
and

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:45.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
that's very important as that hiccup for
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
you it either says to us oh that's an
 
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
outlier we didn't know about that we may
 
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
need to look into that or it tracks with
 
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
what we've been hearing from numbers of
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
other people
 
00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
and then finally we'll give you five
 
00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:06.469 align:start position:0%
and then finally we'll give you five
minutes

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:10.259 align:start position:0%
the best testimony we heard here in my
 
00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:11.270 align:start position:0%
the best testimony we heard here in my
opinion

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
I was clocking it it was three minutes
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
and 40 seconds excuse me three minutes
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
and 47 seconds it was precise on the
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
point brief and hopeful so
 
00:08:28.689 --> 00:08:28.699 align:start position:0%
with that in mind chair recognizes uh
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Smith now
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
um are you with Cynthia Smith
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
and I take it you're speaking to the
 
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.829 align:start position:0%
and I take it you're speaking to the
same

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:29.540 align:start position:0%
you have to press the button
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:40.019 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee I
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
am Lindsey Smith I am a survivor of
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and attempted murder
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
after years of psychological and sexual
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
abuse by my domestic partner at the time
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
I petitioned for a restraining order at
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
the Hampton Police Department on
 
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
November 21st of 2021 judge Polly Hall
 
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
the 10th Circuit Court granted a
 
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
temporary restraining order that same
 
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.570 align:start position:0%
temporary restraining order that same
day

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
to last 30 days
 
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
I believe that the largest mistake was
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
made then
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
by moving forward with my case in Civil
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
Court instead of
 
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.550 align:start position:0%
Court instead of
Criminal

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
Criminal
 
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.690 align:start position:0%

Court

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%

my

domestic partner at the time
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
containing veiled threats deranged
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
statements and blackmail
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
I presented photos of my entire body
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
covered in bruises to the court
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
which they requested
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to the police which they
 
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
requested I wait to present in court
 
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence that I endured and
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
described was criminal and it should
 
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
have been treated as such I did not know
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
that then
 
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
had the hearing been in Criminal Court
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
my abuser would have had to show up to
 
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
defend himself
 
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
on October 20th of 2021
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
I appeared before judge Polly hall for
 
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
the final domestic violence hearing with
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
only my father in tow
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
as I did not have legal representation
 
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
and the court appointed Advocate did not
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
show up
 
00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:32.339 align:start position:0%
nor did my abuser he must have been
 
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
flagrantly confident that the
 
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
petition would be denied I knew very
 
00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
quickly by the tone of her voice and
 
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
facial expressions during the
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
proceedings that she was not going to
 
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
help me
 
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:49.100 align:start position:0%
my dad got that Prussian as well as well
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
in fact this final petition or
 
00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
restraining order was denied for reason
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
of in bold letter in bold letters
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
plaintiff has not been abused
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
and that thin piece of paper that had
 
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
managed to keep Rick away from me for
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
most of the short 30-day temporary order
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
was no longer in place because a woman
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
not qualified to see behavioral patterns
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
that determine my words under oath were
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
fake or perhaps unimportant
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
again he wasn't there
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
then on November 6 Rick picked up a
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
pistol that he'd ordered in hookset
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
one with which he was well acquainted
 
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
from usat the firing range
 
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
and his supposed time service in the
 
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
Army and police force although it was
 
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
always difficult for me to know what was
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
fact or fiction
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
he was convincing and often Charming
 
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.269 align:start position:0%
he was convincing and often Charming
liar

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
liar
 
00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
on November 15th just a week following
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
the gun purchase and two weeks after the
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
restraining order had been denied Rick
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
waited outside of my work for me to
 
00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
leave and then belligerently was
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
screaming at me in an argument outside
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
children's gymnastics studio
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
and emptied most of his magazine trying
 
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
to murder me at close range as I pleaded
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
on my knees for my life
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
fortunately of the 12 rounds in the
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
magazine only three hit my head
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
one missing my carotid artery by a
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
fraction of a millimeter
 
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
I praise God every day for that
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
so although despite my
 
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
seven brain surgeries in year and a half
 
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
in hospitalization
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
my skull jaw and spine are still
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
smattered with bullet fragments as you
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
can see
 
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
I can walk around all right with the
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
brace and I speak pretty well now
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
however the road has been long and I'm
 
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
not quite sure how I've carried on
 
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
it baffles me that had this restraining
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
order been granted Rick would not have
 
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
been able to purchase the gun that he
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
would you accept some questions from us
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
when you first went to the police I
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
believe you said for a restraining order
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
um did you try to convince them that
 
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
you had been physically abused and
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
showed them the places that would prove
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
it I showed them the photographs that I
 
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
had on my phone that I'd taken over the
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
months and years okay
 
00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:56.329 align:start position:0%
months and years okay
um

00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:56.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
so you decided to go forward in civil
 
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.389 align:start position:0%
so you decided to go forward in civil
courts

00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:15:05.769 --> 00:15:05.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
recommendations or options by the police
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
um I guess recommended and decided that
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
a temporary restraining order would be
 
00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:20.389 align:start position:0%
a temporary restraining order would be
immediately

00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately and
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
that was granted the same day
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
for a temporary
 
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.329 align:start position:0%
for a temporary
order

00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
did it seem to you that the judge said
 
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff has not been abused
 
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
because there was no evidence presented
 
00:15:45.769 --> 00:15:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's where my hand doesn't work very
 
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
well that statement from the judge was
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
not until the final
 
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.710 align:start position:0%
not until the final
hearing

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.090 align:start position:0%
hearing
later

00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
that there had been no abuse so
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
I believe that she felt that my evidence
 
00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
presented wasn't Timely
 
00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:11.329 align:start position:0%
presented wasn't Timely
enough

00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.339 --> 00:16:11.949 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:11.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
because some of the photos were dated in
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
two or three years prior okay
 
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.650 align:start position:0%
two or three years prior okay
so

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.370 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
I think that was where the decision came
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
from one of the things I hear from
 
00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
judges I know personally outside of all
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
of this is that they can't rule on
 
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
something they don't have and when
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
someone comes in per se meaning
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
representing yourself
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
people don't think of these things
 
00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
and so it didn't happen
 
00:16:45.899 --> 00:16:47.769 align:start position:0%
and so it didn't happen
um

00:16:47.769 --> 00:16:47.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
what would you recommend I'll give you a
 
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
be me that would be you and move the mic
 
00:16:55.689 --> 00:16:55.699 align:start position:0%
to your
 
00:17:00.129 --> 00:17:00.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
but that's easier okay
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
hi hi my name is Cindy Smith oh good
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
morning fine a little bit louder a
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
little bit closer most of the ears up
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
here over 70.
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
well some of the years sorry
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Cindy Smith the mother of
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Smith and I humbly request you
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
hear my recommendations for courts to
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
more properly handle domestic violence
 
00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.990 align:start position:0%
more properly handle domestic violence
cases

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
I would like to regress and give you a
 
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
very brief
 
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
opinion of the decision not to Grant the
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
restraining order
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
I believe this decision was capricious
 
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
negligent and possibly an unwitting
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
capricious you're going to hear from a
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
tiny little woman

there may have been

things she missed

warning signs
 
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
questions that should cause pause she
 
00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:24.539 align:start position:0%
should pause about some of the things
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
she heard
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
and I will get to the unwitting
 
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.230 align:start position:0%
and I will get to the unwitting
accomplice

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
accomplice
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
she was granted a 30-day restraining
 
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
order based on pictures of bruises all
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
over her body texts and a letter from
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
her boss who received phone calls at
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
from the perp telling lies an attempt to
 
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
get her fired some of this was years old
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
some only a few months
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
she also reported being a sex slave
 
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
but on the day of the second hearing
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
Lindsay learned she had to have new
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
evidence newer than a few months
 
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
I don't want to continue on the
 
00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:12.419 align:start position:0%
unwitting accomplice because if Polly
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
had read reports she would have read
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
that the cop told Lindsay this was a
 
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant issue
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
we also don't know what the port told
 
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
the police because he did give the
 
00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
impression of a good old boy just trying
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
to help
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
nonetheless in the 30 days between
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
hearings and until the shooting Lindsay
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
was in flight mode she traveled to
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
California and Miami and Newport to see
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
friends and know she couldn't afford it
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
it was all on credit
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
both Lindsay and her roommates in
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
Hampton moved out temporarily because
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
they were fearful
 
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:48.620 align:start position:0%
Lindsay psychiatrist and therapist
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
repeatedly told her that he would
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
eventually kill her because of his
 
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
threats of getting her fired hadn't
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
produced the desired
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
effects and he was losing control of her
 
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
as she was recovering in Therapies
 
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
so my recommendation for the future DV
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
domestic violent cases would be to take
 
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
the onus off of the victim
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
to prove dangerousness
 
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
I emphasize victim should not have the
 
00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:24.419 align:start position:0%
sole onus to prove someone's
 
00:20:24.419 --> 00:20:26.150 align:start position:0%
sole onus to prove someone's
dangerousness

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
dangerousness
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
victims like Lindsay do not always think
 
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.529 align:start position:0%
victims like Lindsay do not always think
clearly

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:30.539 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
they can provide some evidence
 
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
but they aren't qualified
 
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
but they aren't qualified
neither

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
neither
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps are most judges
 
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
judges no laws and how to apply them
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
after the crime but they don't
 
00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:45.299 align:start position:0%
understand human behavior they're not
 
00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:47.150 align:start position:0%
understand human behavior they're not
trained

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
trained
 
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
experienced psychologists are therapists
 
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
experienced psychologists are therapists
are

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
thus I offer
 
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
in the 30 days between restraining
 
00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:55.970 align:start position:0%
in the 30 days between restraining
orders

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
orders
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
the courts could have hired hired a
 
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
panel of forensic psychologists or
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
therapist to interview both parties
 
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
they can look at backgrounds such as
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
education job history stability
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
possibly administer some personality
 
00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:15.230 align:start position:0%
possibly administer some personality
inventories

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
inventories
 
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
possibly contact
 
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
the plank the people's therapists of
 
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
both parties I'm guessing most victims
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
have therapists or counselors I'm not
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
sure Lindsay did
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
wasn't anyone uninterested and what
 
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
Lindsay meant by the term sexling no one
 
00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.830 align:start position:0%
Lindsay meant by the term sexling no one
asked

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
but I understand why because it's all
 
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.970 align:start position:0%
but I understand why because it's all
public

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
psychologists understand that past
 
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
behavior is the best indicator of future
 
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.789 align:start position:0%
behavior is the best indicator of future
performance

00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you both for coming in I
 
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
can only imagine thank you Mr chairman
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
for letting me ask my question I want to
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you both for coming in I can only
 
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
imagine how incredibly difficult that is
 
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
for you and I really appreciate that you
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
when you first contacted the police may
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
I ask what prompted you at the time to
 
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
contact them what were you reporting had
 
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.950 align:start position:0%
contact them what were you reporting had
happened

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:32.630 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
he had just given me a basically a Tour
 
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
de France of his gun collection
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
and he had been sending me text messages
 
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.990 align:start position:0%
and he had been sending me text messages
that

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
said things like
 
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.890 align:start position:0%
said things like
um

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:48.059 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay I'm going to make
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
you pay
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
and when I told him that he wasn't
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
allowed to talk to me because I was
 
00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:54.299 align:start position:0%
afraid of him
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
he said I can't hear you my life would
 
00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
which in hindsight was good foresight
 
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
that he
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
he when he showed her the his gun
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
collection he had
 
00:23:18.409 --> 00:23:18.419 align:start position:0%
followed her and waited for her in
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
Marblehead Massachusetts
 
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.610 align:start position:0%
Marblehead Massachusetts
um

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
and he he made her
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
go to a public park and he displayed
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
them to her as I recall Lindsay telling
 
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
me this
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
um and she was breaking up with him and
 
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
she was trying to get away
 
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.470 align:start position:0%
she was trying to get away
and

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
that is his why and he wouldn't leave
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
he also said that he was going to f up
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
her life
 
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
that everything she thought was right
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
and good would be no longer
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up thank you Mr chairman
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
when he showed you the weapons was it in
 
00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:12.539 align:start position:0%
a manner that was that you perceived to
 
00:24:15.169 --> 00:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
be threatening you when he or to in a
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
form that was meant to uh cause cause
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
he phrased it as though he just wanted
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
to show me his like it was a show and
 
00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:30.409 align:start position:0%
to show me his like it was a show and
tell

00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:30.419 align:start position:0%
tell
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
how it made me feel was extremely
 
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.190 align:start position:0%
how it made me feel was extremely
fearful

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
fearful
 
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
and I believe it was intended to be
 
00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
and I believe it was intended to be
threatening

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
threatening
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
when the restraining order the 30-day
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
he sold I guess his guns to his brother
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
which is why he did not have them
 
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.510 align:start position:0%
which is why he did not have them
anymore

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
in which y he bought the other one
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh for your
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
testimony and I want to specifically
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539 align:start position:0%
for the the uh suggestion you gave
 
00:25:15.539 --> 00:25:16.430 align:start position:0%
for the the uh suggestion you gave
um

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
I found that to be right on point and
 
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
very very helpful no one in this room
 
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.690 align:start position:0%
very very helpful no one in this room
um

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
feels good about
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
what you have gone through and I'm sure
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
of that and then the question is where
 
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
do we go from here your suggestion is
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
something that I think will be very
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
important to this committee and the
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
committee will give due diligence I
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
wonder do you have any other suggestions
 
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
that you would like to make
 
00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:54.779 align:start position:0%
um to try to
 
00:25:54.779 --> 00:25:56.630 align:start position:0%
um to try to
um

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:03.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:06.299 align:start position:0%
do the best job possible with we have
 
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
issues with the separate I mean there's
 
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
the police and that was one component
 
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
and then they're the courts and that's
 
00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
another component
 
00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:17.110 align:start position:0%
another component
um

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
you've had experience that some of us
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
have never had and never want to have
 
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
I I have no other
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
thoughts about this this well thank you
 
00:26:30.649 --> 00:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
again for that for that suggestion do
 
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
you have a copy of your testimony that
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
you could provide to us
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay if you would uh do you have a
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
you're not done yet
 
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
um representative Greg hi thank you Mr
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I apologize for my tardiness
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
today and I will go back and watch the
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
extent of yours thank you so much for
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
coming in today I understand the
 
00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:57.539 align:start position:0%
vulnerability that it takes to even
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
rehash all of that so thank you so much
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
and it's so important because there are
 
00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:03.020 align:start position:0%
very few survivors
 
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
that are able to go and tell their story
 
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
like that I guess my one question
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
because we're looking at the courts and
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
stuff is for your case and I know that
 
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:15.299 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases violence cases
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
are incredibly hard actually to prove
 
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
and that onus is I mean it really is
 
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
very hard because a lot of time abusers
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
will a claim abuse but they also you
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
know are very charming and that's kind
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
of how you get into that but is there
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
anything within the courts that when you
 
00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:33.299 align:start position:0%
were trying to prove your case that you
 
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
feel like was a true Miss I know we
 
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
talked about you know having a panel or
 
00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
whatever else but
 
00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:42.299 align:start position:0%
that you were supported as far as like
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
what you knew you needed to provide is
 
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
there a Miss there that like you know
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
you should have provided this or they
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
told you later that you should have had
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
that that maybe
 
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
um that there was just a Miss there with
 
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
well I I did meet with an advocate prior
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
to the hearing and she helped me fill
 
00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:09.419 align:start position:0%
out a form which then looked as though
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
it was written in the third person and
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that it was very
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
helpful to anyone
 
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
and then she did not show up to support
 
00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:21.059 align:start position:0%
me and the day of so that was
 
00:28:21.059 --> 00:28:23.710 align:start position:0%
me and the day of so that was
disappointing

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
I would offer that
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
my husband
 
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
before we left within a week before a
 
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
week went to the second hearing as he
 
00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:36.419 align:start position:0%
said do we need a lawyer
 
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
and Lindsay said no I've got somebody
 
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
coming and of course
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
we didn't know you needed a lawyer
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
why would we need a lawyer we were she
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.149 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
I've written down but I would I would
 
00:28:59.930 --> 00:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
recommend that to everybody to bring a
 
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
lawyer I've written down a few other
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
things besides judicial education in
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
psychology of abuse victimhood stalking
 
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
psychological slavery I also wrote down
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
that the court system should consider
 
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
having a psychologist
 
00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
if not on staff then on ready retainer
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
to speak to people I also put down here
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
consider a new protocol
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
under what circumstances the court on
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
its own would decide if this needs to be
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
kicked up to criminal in other words not
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
make the litigant right think of it but
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
it should be a protocol in place and
 
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
then thirdly
 
00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.690 align:start position:0%
then thirdly
um

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
you know lawyers are expensive I had a
 
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:48.500 align:start position:0%
Higher One recently
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
but going pro se has its
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
downside as well I'm wondering if there
 
00:29:58.850 --> 00:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
were a document that was put together on
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
what you need to know if you're seeking
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
a restraining order and lists several
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
things of the collective wisdom of
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
people who figured it out or lawyers who
 
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
know what should be on it that could be
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
given to somebody who then wishes to go
 
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.669 align:start position:0%
through this
yes

00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
there was the only thing I was directed
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
to was a page on a website
 
00:30:26.399 --> 00:30:27.649 align:start position:0%
to was a page on a website
and

00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
it was somewhat informative but
 
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
I agree with my mother that I probably
 
00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:36.539 align:start position:0%
needed a lawyer
 
00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question I wanted to clarify
 
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
after you contacted the police
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
department did they send you down to the
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
police to the court to fill out the form
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
on your own without helping you and then
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
who was it that did help you fill out
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
the form was it a specific agency or was
 
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:03.740 align:start position:0%
it the court
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
The Advocate I believe filled out the
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
form and that is it was filled out in
 
00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
this third person manner
 
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
like referring to myself as Lindsay
 
00:31:15.889 --> 00:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
instead of I
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
and it made it very confusing for the
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
judge I think she mentioned that
 
00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:24.059 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up
 
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
um who was was The Advocate from the
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
court or from an agency or do you do you
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
know where the advocate was from or not
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
sure I am not sure the police just said
 
00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:36.419 align:start position:0%
somebody would be calling me
 
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
okay so the police put you in when you
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
contacted the police they put you in

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I created a traffic jam didn't
 
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
we'll work it out
 
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:16.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
good man morning Mr chair and committee
 
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
my name is Destiny Berard any big system
 
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
whether it's courts or police or big
 
00:33:27.169 --> 00:33:27.179 align:start position:0%
government agencies is going to have
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
some bad apples in it even if it's an
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise okay system obviously we'd
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
like to hope that police could help us
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
with domestic violence but in my case
 
00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:39.059 align:start position:0%
one of those police officers was a bad
 
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
apple I was hesitant to come forward
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
before now because I dated a
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts police officer but when
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts just released its new
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
police misconduct database I learned for
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
the very first time that my ex had been
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
formally disciplined for excessive use
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
of force
 
00:33:59.409 --> 00:33:59.419 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:02.220 align:start position:0%
that's right I dated a cop with a gun
 
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
who had been formally disciplined for
 
00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
excessive use of force when our
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
relationship ended he threatened me with
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
his authority of being a police officer
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
and that is very familiar with how the
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
system works and his ability to
 
00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:18.899 align:start position:0%
manipulate and abuse it if needed toward
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
the end I was trying to salvage the
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
relationship but he didn't like the text
 
00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:25.139 align:start position:0%
he was getting from me he was also
 
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
worried about his job because of things
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
I knew he had done wrong at work
 
00:34:32.089 --> 00:34:32.099 align:start position:0%
I live in Massachusetts but when he
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
couldn't manipulate the system in
 
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to get an order against me
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
he went jurisdiction shopping and
 
00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
managed to get a civil order against me
 
00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire a family court judge
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
granted a six foot one weapon-carrying
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
police officer in order of protection
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
against a four foot ten unarmed woman It
 
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
is believed it is because he lived here
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
and because New Hampshire Family Court
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
judges seemed to get to do what whatever
 
00:34:59.450 --> 00:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
they want there
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
so how am I subject to a New Hampshire
 
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
restraining order even though I'm not a
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
citizen of your state and I can't even
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
vote for any of you
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
if your job is to fix New Hampshire laws
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
then please fix them because they're way
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
too easy for an abuser to manipulate and
 
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
while judge Polly Hall keeps extending
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
the order indefinitely your your laws
 
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
are affecting people like myself who
 
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
so basically it's
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
the same you know we've dealt with the
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
same judge and but it's almost the
 
00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
he was granted an order on absolutely
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
nothing from the same judge and one
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
thing that I see being a huge problem is
 
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
because I didn't show up for the first
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
hearing because I was intimidated by him
 
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
so not showing up for that order when I
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
did show up for the extension I wasn't
 
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
allowed to show anything from the past
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know the relationship the abuse of
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
nature on his part they don't the judge
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
isn't interested in that it's only from
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
that point forward
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
you know and at that point we weren't in
 
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
a relationship but he was still being
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
granted these orders I'm not sure she
 
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
stated that she had a seven year
 
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
restraining order against her
 
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
because of Facebook posts and simple as
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
that right
 
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
and it just keeps getting continued
 
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
where you know Lindsay the microphone
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
can be completely different
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know I even presented photos of
 
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.430 align:start position:0%
you know I even presented photos of
Lindsay

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
Lindsay
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
and then compared to my Facebook
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
images that granted a five-year
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
extension and just it doesn't add up
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
that you know somebody can there was
 
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
just there's no Rhyme or Reason to how
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
they're granted at all
 
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
that would be the capriciousness it so
 
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
the gist of it is the big question of
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
how evidence is evaluated
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
in granting or not granting a
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
restraining order that's the big picture
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
right and just the fact that
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
once you're it's almost like who gets
 
00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
there first
 
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
which is usually the abuser because
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
that's what they want they want to get
 
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
there first so they can have the
 
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.030 align:start position:0%
there first so they can have the
narrative

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
narrative
 
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
and once that they get there the victim
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
has no there's like nothing we can do at
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
that point the judge is already set on
 
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
what they've seen from
 
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
the first person that was there and it's
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
like tunnel vision they don't
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
they don't look beyond that and that was
 
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
a huge problem because I know for a fact
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
if I was able to present the abuse that
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
I went through it would have been a
 
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
completely different story but they
 
00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
don't allow that
 
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay that's helpful that is helpful
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
anyone have question
 
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative catab thank you Mr
 
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for coming in for
 
00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I just so I'm
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly the initial
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
hearing to give the restraining order is
 
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
it correct that you didn't attend and so
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
that's why at the subsequent continuance
 
00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
hearing you weren't allowed to submit
 
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
the evidence correct thank you you're
 
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
welcome what was the reason for your
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
non-attendance at the first tearing
 
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
because throughout the relationship he
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
continuously threatened me that he's a
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
cop and he knows the way you know he
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
knows how to do things in court and
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
even his initial
 
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.430 align:start position:0%
even his initial
um

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
filing the one that I didn't show up to
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
still does not
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
fall under any of the requirements to
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
get a restraining order and he did
 
00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.450 align:start position:0%
get a restraining order and he did
somehow

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to us sorry
 
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
I only do that this way now I'm doing it
 
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
this way
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman uh thank

those were the quotes that he brought
 
00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.170 align:start position:0%
those were the quotes that he brought
into

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
to show the judge that he was annoyed
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
with your broken heart betrayal okay
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:47.700 align:start position:0%

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
um you both
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%

I live in Massachusetts he lived in
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire but he's
 
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
so he first went to Massachusetts trying
 
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
to get an order but they saw right
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
through him and that's why he came to
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and was able to get one so
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
was his residence in in Massachusetts or
 
00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:20.579 align:start position:0%

for my testimony I will suggest several
 
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
fixes for New Hampshire family law and
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
if the legislature has the courage to
 
00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
protect basic civil rights and follow
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%

and right to a jury of their peers
 
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
family laws currently administrating
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
criminal fines and penalties with no
 
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
jury trial this is unjust
 
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
all complaints of family law judges will
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
be mandatorily investigated by the
 
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee and
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
investigations will be made public
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
sunlight is the best disinfectant
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
RSA 458c child support guidelines
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
requires a complete overhaul as it
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
stands one person a parent with less
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
than 50 percent parenting time pays the
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
other parent whether the 51 or more
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
parent earns more or refuses to work
 
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
this is abusive unjust and clearly
 
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
unequal protections of the law
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
all family law judges appear to be
 
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
violating federal law 18 U.S Code
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph 242 deprivation of rights
 
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
under the color of law I suggest you get
 
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
a federal prosecutor on this issue
 
00:43:34.849 --> 00:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
no additional Justice seats currently at
 
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
the cost of approximately two hundred
 
00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:38.099 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year will be
 
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
recommended we need rights upheld the
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
law upheld more money means more
 
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.990 align:start position:0%
law upheld more money means more
problems

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court of New Hampshire is
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
reviewing whether the denial of my
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
parental rights regarding medical
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
decision making for vaccines is lawful
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier my first
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
amendment religious rights have been
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
blatantly violated New Hampshire state
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
law RSA 141c and 20 have been overridden
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
in federal law 18 USC 242 has been
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
violated by the family law judge the
 
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
medical procedure I objected to my child
 
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
receiving is not mandated by law for
 
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
attending school and yet none of that
 
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
seems to matter because family law
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
judges currently have few repercussions
 
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
in closing it is my belief New Hampshire
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
family law is an unjust court system
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
children are denied equal access to a
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
parent and their side of the family
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
absent indictment of a crime and jury
 
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
trial judges have few repercussions for
 
00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:37.859 align:start position:0%
their actions child support guidelines
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
are bankrupting one party for having
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
percentages less time with their child
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
the court system appears to be unjust
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
and must be reformed if this legislature
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
fails to uphold the rights of the free
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire we will have no
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
choice than to claim relief in article
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
10 of the New Hampshire Constitution
 
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
right of Revolution Live Free or Die
 
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh do you have a copy of that because if
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
you do we'll read it and we will funnel
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
at least some of it into the different
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
subgroup that we'll be looking at things
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
I'll email it over I'm sorry I will
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
email it over okay
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
um equal parenting issue is one that is
 
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
presently before us children and family
 
00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
law committee will be looking uh in a
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
work session uh next month at House Bill
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
185 on that kind of an issue so it's a
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
live topic for us which doesn't mean
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
this group may not also take a a look at
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
it but a few of the things you've
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
touched on
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
are already in the hopper and a few more
 
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
may become so because of your testimony
 
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
today we await it
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
and as for the legislature having
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
courage I'm only Air Force I'm not a
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
and thank you all for how much I know
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
you care about this subject
 
00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to read you just
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
the title of about 17 issues that I've
 
00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:08.339 align:start position:0%
identified from talking to people who
 
00:47:10.609 --> 00:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
are troubled by what happened in Family
 
00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:12.410 align:start position:0%
are troubled by what happened in Family
Court

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
um and I can send you more detail but
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
for my five minutes I just figured this
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
I would touch on many subjects and
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
hopefully many of you have already been
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
con concerned about them
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
a new one for me was we need to
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
authorize enforcement of court orders
 
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
but the police are state troopers or the
 
00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:38.099 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department right now if you go
 
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
to pick up your child for your
 
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
visitation that's guaranteed in court
 
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
order the police will tell you that's a
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
court issue we don't do that go back to
 
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.170 align:start position:0%
court issue we don't do that go back to
court

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
you're holding a court order
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
how is that going to change if you go
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
back to court
 
00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
we need to create an appeals process for
 
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:00.500 align:start position:0%
Family Court litigants to address
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
incorrect statements of fact in court
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
orders right now we don't have any way
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
to request it de novo
 
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
we can most people don't know you can
 
00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
ask to reopen the case because right now
 
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
most people have no recourse when they
 
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
get out of the judge's decision and it's
 
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.630 align:start position:0%
get out of the judge's decision and it's
got

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know what to call them they're
 
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
not facts they're incorrect facts that
 
00:48:31.849 --> 00:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:35.060 align:start position:0%
when domestic violence is alleged
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
we have the problem of both people who
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
are victims not being believed or
 
00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:47.750 align:start position:0%
are victims not being believed or
advised

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
advised
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't be in family court it's
 
00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:52.859 align:start position:0%
a crime we also have the problem of
 
00:48:55.609 --> 00:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
people thinking that if they accuse if
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
they're getting a divorce if they accuse
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
the other person of domestic violence
 
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
they could get a better deal and then
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
then after they swayed the pinions then
 
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
they dropped the charges you're going to
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
need to give less commentary you said
 
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
you have 17 you've only done three or
 
00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
four and you're running out of time okay
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
so both things both false and accurate
 
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
need a processed cutie uh stop courts
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
from ordering months of counseling in
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
the mistaken view that domestic abuse is
 
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
a disagreement between equals
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
you can bankrupt people especially if
 
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
you order reunification therapy which is
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
not covered by insurance and also we
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
have an RSA that prescribes that you're
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
supposed to order if you order cons uh
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
counseling it's supposed to be what
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
their insurance covers CFL is looking at
 
00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
that one next month as well in work
 
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
session great
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
make shared parenting the default for
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
child custody
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
requiring investigation into reasons
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
requiring investigations into reasons
 
00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
given to deny 50 50. uh obviously
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse would be a reason not to
 
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
give it only whoops only a point
 
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.829 align:start position:0%
give it only whoops only a point
judges

00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:50:20.329 --> 00:50:20.339 align:start position:0%
who have only appoint Family Court
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
judges uh people who have experience
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
this was advised to Children family law
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
well actually the judge came here and
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
said that uh thanks to marjorie's
 
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
representative Margie's request for what
 
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
he had advised so he said just choose
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
abide by the U.S Constitution's Bill of
 
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:51.710 align:start position:0%
abide by the U.S Constitution's Bill of
Rights

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
I think we already have heard people
 
00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
testify that they don't have rights you
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
have more rights going being charged
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
with a crime and going in Criminal Court
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
and you don't have the right to a speedy
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
so without without the right to give
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
evidence and testimony in defense of you
 
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
that is a violation of constitutional
 
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:19.089 align:start position:0%
that is a violation of constitutional
rights

00:51:19.089 --> 00:51:19.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
take family court judges off the circuit
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
so they only preside over family court
 
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
cases and that will help restore the RSA
 
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
that prescribes one family one judge I
 
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
have met many families who have met five
 
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.829 align:start position:0%
have met many families who have met five
judges

00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
so they don't have a continuation
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
they're not familiar with the case
 
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
continue child support when the amount
 
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
is awaiting a hearing in some cases it's
 
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
just terminated well that's not very
 
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
fair to the children or the person who's
 
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
taking care of them
 
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
but when child support stops due to a
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
job loss or a catastrophic illness Grant
 
00:52:02.569 --> 00:52:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
establish a statistics collection on
 
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
family court cases on pertinent subjects
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
like what percentage of children are
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
ordered never to see both parents
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
audit the State child support collection
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
Services they keep making mistakes and
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
charging people who may be a week or
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
maybe as much as a month behind and
 
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
taking their driver's license or
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
threatening to take the driver's license
 
00:52:29.089 --> 00:52:29.099 align:start position:0%
whereas other people are months in
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
arrears and play the game of not paying
 
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
up until the person they're supposed to
 
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
pay to pay gets a hearing and then they
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
pay up the week before so they're not
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
guilty but there's no penalty this is a
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
awful game
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
establish one or more JCC oversight
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
Boards of legislators and citizens who
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
have no court connections to review
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
litigant claims currently almost all
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
claims get the same no-finding response
 
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
and that goes for gal filings too
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
judge poly Hall is still a judge
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
allow Family Court judges to overrule
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
family court rules only when ignoring
 
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
the rule is fair to both parties
 
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
and require the recusal of a judge when
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
one of the litigants is represented by
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
his or her current or pass Law Firm that
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
how many seconds have I gone over
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I wasn't counting this
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
is this is very helpful thank you and I
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%

everybody that's just for you here
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
um because that way I can put them in
 
00:53:52.609 --> 00:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
files easily rather than busting things
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
up okay I will do that does everybody
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
want that
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%

specific
 
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
issues of alleged problems
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
without rehashing a case it really helps
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
though that you've heard other people
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the same issue so it's not
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
just one person coming up and saying I
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%

of testimony is cumulative
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
experiences research and at times
 
00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:47.339 align:start position:0%
repetitive voices on this particular
 
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
subject as well as any other related
 
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.750 align:start position:0%

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:52.859 align:start position:0%
having contributed to seeking a solution
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
to Justice
 
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
it would be remiss to not acknowledge
 
00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
the countless
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
negative experiences that have led to
 
00:56:04.609 --> 00:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
the dedicated efforts of legislators
 
00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
like you
 
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
the citizens I'm just going to remind
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
you you've got five minutes thank you
 
00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
very much I know you love us
 
00:56:12.059 --> 00:56:13.190 align:start position:0%
very much I know you love us
um

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
it is a thank you it is a thank you
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
yeah as much as I hate to interrupt that
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
yeah this is this is actually very short
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
okay keep it on
 
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
so what I've done is I have looked at
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
the numerical and the mathematics
 
00:56:31.569 --> 00:56:31.579 align:start position:0%
that apply to Family Court such as
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
accounting regulations title 4D the
 
00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.109 align:start position:0%
accounting regulations title 4D the
formulas

00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
formulas
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
um these are pieces that consistently
 
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
are missing and is part of the failures
 
00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
of what appears to be the due process
 
00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:44.990 align:start position:0%
of what appears to be the due process
pieces

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.870 align:start position:0%
pieces
uh

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
the patterns of the problems suggest
 
00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
that the various roles and silos of
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
service and service providers associated
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
with the processes and procedures and
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
the resources
 
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
are part of the problem
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
understanding the problem and seeking
 
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:06.980 align:start position:0%
the solutions
 
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
research and experiences suggesting that
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
the issue design is complex by way of
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
outside Source contributors
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
the problem appears to be external
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
influences on economics
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
on the executive branch
 
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
and from title IV D Money prospects
 
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
the use of systems to analyze family
 
00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
case details has potential options that
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
evolve into complex difficult and at
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
times contentious motivations
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
the split Direction in this situation
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
is the case management road maps
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
and it splits and it puts a position
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
where you're either serving New
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families
 
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
or you're providing service to
 
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
institutional stakeholders
 
00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
there's various research there's
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
accounting requirements for title 4D
 
00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:01.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
in Family Court a repetitive objection
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
is the fails
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
to pass a reasonable justification
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
because of New Hampshire rule 2.2 which
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
we've all talked about a lot
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
um but by default
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
the litigant loses loss of guaranteed
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
ability to present evidence as defined
 
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
in the 14th Amendment
 
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
so suspend the rule of evidence and by
 
00:58:34.609 --> 00:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
default the loss is guaranteed
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
this is a common
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
Family Court complaint of
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated narratives being used
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
artificially manufactured
 
00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
standards of perjury gaslighting fraud
 
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
the artificial narratives are extremely
 
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
harmful to the families and here we are
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
as recent as May 5th 2023 the governor's
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
Commission on domestic violence sexual
 
00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
assault and stalking
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
had discussions that highlighted
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
and in no particular order
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
the issues of Family Court weaponizing
 
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
the family court process abuse of
 
00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
processes expunging errors lying and
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
referencing gaps that are in the process
 
00:59:17.329 --> 00:59:17.339 align:start position:0%
there's various laws and I have about 10
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of me I'm not going to
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
quote them
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
that our local New Hampshire rsas
 
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
clearly Federal and some criminal code
 
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
that is consistently being
 
00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:32.210 align:start position:0%
that is consistently being
abused

00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
abused
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
the solution it appears
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
historical and current operations are
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
just crushing I mean crushing
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
a vast number of families in New
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire year after year including
 
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
extensive harm to children
 
00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:48.299 align:start position:0%
the failures of due process appear to
 
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
not meet the family needs or title 4D
 
00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:54.470 align:start position:0%
not meet the family needs or title 4D
requirements

00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:59:57.049 --> 00:59:57.059 align:start position:0%
current operations appeared to and do
 
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
establish winners and losers all to
 
01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
facilitate the state benefits to the
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
maximum and the extent which equates to
 
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
title 4D
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
the solution the few minutes you have I
 
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
hope I think you you just said the word
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
over me and that's good because this is
 
01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:15.770 align:start position:0%
over me and that's good because this is
all

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
yep big Theory and not helpful it's
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
Preparatory it is not helpful we need
 
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
specific recommendations the references
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
and appendix that I've attached to this
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
do explain that in detail what
 
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry we didn't pass out no these
 
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
are your copies oh
 
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
okay I do have your copies can we have
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
our copies absolutely thank you for my
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
apology Dana would you mind
 
01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.870 align:start position:0%
apology Dana would you mind
okay

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
my apologies on that I I gave everything
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
yes those are all for me yes those are
 
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
so back to the solution I did put them
 
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
as as in relevant order as I could
 
01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:09.589 align:start position:0%
as as in relevant order as I could
um

01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
the handouts that you have Risky
 
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
Business which highlighted how the New
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire courts was going to become a
 
01:01:17.809 --> 01:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
business entity
 
01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
um the trends appendix two three and
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
four the future of unified Family Court
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
s in the predictive algorithms and the
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire requested action
 
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.450 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire requested action
document

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
in the end after looking at the numbers
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
and doing all the pieces which you now
 
01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:35.900 align:start position:0%
have a lot of That Base information
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
the solution
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
and anything that doesn't work in
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
mediation needs to go to criminal and
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
civil court because that's where this
 
01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.670 align:start position:0%
civil court because that's where this
belong

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
belong
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
apply the Rules of Evidence
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
my esteemed Vice chair
 
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
my esteemed chair I'm trying to get the
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
word c in here so we'll feel warmer yeah
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
I tried again by the way but
 
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.530 align:start position:0%
I tried again by the way but
um

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
Miss Heimer could you tell me who are
 
01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:25.980 align:start position:0%

01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
myself and every other person that's
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
been in here testifying

and um I mean you have some very
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
if I could continue you have some very
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
detailed weighty materials that you that
 
01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
you gave us and so I guess I I'd like to
 
01:02:48.049 --> 01:02:48.059 align:start position:0%
have a a little more sense of you and
 
01:02:48.059 --> 01:02:49.370 align:start position:0%
have a a little more sense of you and
um

01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
kind of what brought you here
 
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
experience and background
 
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
um education but most of all the
 
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
experience of actually
 
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
going through the family court process
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
for over a decade
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
and then to come here
 
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
and listen to story after Story some
 
01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
more tragic some less tragic
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
some shorter some longer
 
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
it laid a pattern a very clear pattern
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
and I can literally
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
almost every case I've heard to some
 
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
extent overlay
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
the various procedures and processes
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
that end you up
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
with the title for dmath
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
with the requirements of accounting that
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
are missing that I'm looking for that I
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
can't seem to get from the state there's
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of issues that just
 
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
added up and math is math
 
01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:45.059 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that answer
 
01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
anything else anyone else
 
01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you so much thank you
 
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you to
 
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm uh former
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Dan Itza uh formerly of
 
01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
Fremont uh if I may just before I begin
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
what you don't realize is that Ms
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
Heinrich before all of this happened to
 
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
her she was a bank vice president
 
01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
and that's why she has the perspective
 
01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
that she has and why she has the
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
analytical skills that she has
 
01:04:37.809 --> 01:04:37.819 align:start position:0%
that helped her through the
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
aftermath of surviving the family courts
 
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
and doing something about it what I'd
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
like to present today
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
is a history because everything has to
 
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:51.950 align:start position:0%
is a history because everything has to
be

01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
done in historical context
 
01:04:55.619 --> 01:04:57.770 align:start position:0%
done in historical context
the

01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%
family courts began in New Hampshire in
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
1995 the bill was submitted by
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
01:05:08.329 --> 01:05:08.339 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the family courts was at
 
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
the time divorce was heard in District
 
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.569 align:start position:0%
the time divorce was heard in District
Court

01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:11.579 align:start position:0%
Court
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
and the family is sitting there waiting
 
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
for their hearing we're also sitting
 
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
there with Petty criminals and the whole
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
idea of family courts that swept Across
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
the Nation in the mid 90s was to get the
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
families out of the company of petty
 
01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.089 align:start position:0%
families out of the company of petty
criminals

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:26.099 align:start position:0%
criminals
 
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
it began in rockhamp County and Grafton
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
County as a pilot program
 
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
and because there's a pilot program and
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
you had now had a new court and all the
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
other uh existing laws were designed for
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
District Court
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
in their Equity jurisdiction Equity is
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
when a court has the power to order you
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
to do something to sell your house to
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
divide your property that's what Equity
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
Court means
 
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
as opposed to Criminal Court which is
 
01:05:57.730 --> 01:05:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
the family court rules their Equity
 
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction began and still does begin
 
01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.549 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction began and still does begin
with

01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of the contrary notwithstanding
 
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
and that means that whatever laws May on
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
the book may be on the books don't
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:18.059 align:start position:0%
and that kind of made sense when when uh
 
01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
family court was a new startup pilot
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
program and you didn't know what
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
the rules were going to be
 
01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:30.380 align:start position:0%
when I came to the legislature in 2001
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
it was a story of fathers separated from
 
01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
their children that's the way the state
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
laws were constructed
 
01:06:40.569 --> 01:06:40.579 align:start position:0%
parent fathers were
 
01:06:43.609 --> 01:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
consistently uh withdrawn from their
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
children the state state practice
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
um in 2003 we expanded it to two more
 
01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:55.010 align:start position:0%
um in 2003 we expanded it to two more
counties

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
in 2005 and I should say that there was
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
a substantial industry in among the
 
01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
legal community in fathers attempting to
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
regain contact with their children there
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
was a business there
 
01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
in 2005 we revamped our custody laws so
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
that they were no longer custody laws it
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
was parenting time
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
and we made every effort to move things
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
from litigation to go to uh negotiation
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
we to make sure that both parents would
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
have contact with their children
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately this
 
01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
really blew the bottom out of the
 
01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:40.970 align:start position:0%
really blew the bottom out of the
industry

01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
but it didn't take them long
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
to create a new methodology
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
the new methodology is you take one
 
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
parent you give them pretty much all
 
01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.529 align:start position:0%
parent you give them pretty much all
custody

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
custody
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
and then you inspire the other parent to
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
regain custody
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
and then you have somebody fighting to
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
get and somebody fighting to keep
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
and you create an event that goes on for
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
two three five years now it's not really
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
a large percentage it's less than 10
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
percent of the divorces that involve
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
this kind of interplay
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
but when there's seven thousand divorces
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
a year in New Hampshire and that means
 
01:08:27.249 --> 01:08:27.259 align:start position:0%
that 700 are subject to this interplay
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
and they last five to ten years you can
 
01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:33.299 align:start position:0%
see there's a substantial number of
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
families that are in this interplay
 
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
being relegated to therapies and returns
 
01:08:42.769 --> 01:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
to court and returns to court and
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
2009 we took the family court Statewide
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
in 2012 we
 
01:08:59.329 --> 01:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
revamped the courts
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
and now we have the circuit courts and
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
the circuit courts include the Probate
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
Court the district court and the family
 
01:09:05.759 --> 01:09:08.150 align:start position:0%
Court the district court and the family
court

01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
typically District Court holds criminal
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
issues and Family Court held civil
 
01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
issues and Probate Court held issues of
 
01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
legacy and uh guardianship things like
 
01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:22.309 align:start position:0%
legacy and uh guardianship things like
that

01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
now a funny thing happened and you have
 
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
two victims of this in the courtroom
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
today in the hearing room today in 2014
 
01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
the family Branch was also given
 
01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
occasional jurisdiction over domestic
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
violence prior to that domestic violence
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
is an assault it's a crime it was
 
01:09:44.329 --> 01:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
handled by The District Court
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
The District Court though it does have
 
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
Equity jurisdiction in some of its cases
 
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
it has rules of equity it has a a set of
 
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
laws that say this is how you handle
 
01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.630 align:start position:0%
laws that say this is how you handle
cases

01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
remember over in Family Court a lot of
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
the contrary notwithstanding no state
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
law really holds
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
and in the interest of the Justice the
 
01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:11.219 align:start position:0%
judge May waive any rule not in statute
 
01:10:11.219 --> 01:10:12.830 align:start position:0%
judge May waive any rule not in statute
so

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:16.130 align:start position:0%
so
nada

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
since 2014 domestic violence violence
 
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
cases have shifted from District Court
 
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
where there are rules and Rules of
 
01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.669 align:start position:0%
where there are rules and Rules of
Evidence

01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
Evidence
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
to Family Court where there are no rules
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
kind of runs like a Bruce Willis movie
 
01:10:38.689 --> 01:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh in 2015
 
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
when I was in the family uh
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
children family law committee the Chief
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
Justice of the circuit court and of the
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
family court came in and they told us
 
01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
something very interesting
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
they could tell
 
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
in the first preliminary hearing when
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
they go in they get told this is what
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
the process for divorce is they could
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
identify those 10 percent of the cases
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:23.330 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
there's there's one thing very
 
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
definitely that you can do
 
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
is take out that one little phrase law
 
01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
to the contrary notwithstanding
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
that exists in their jurisdiction of
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
cases which means they can really take
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
any case they want
 
01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:43.340 align:start position:0%
and that's uh 490d
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
colon 2 and
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
what is the letter 490 490 D Dash D
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
colon two and colon 3. and that same
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
little introductory phrase which says is
 
01:11:59.450 --> 01:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of the contrary notwithstanding
 
01:12:03.169 --> 01:12:03.179 align:start position:0%
read in spite of any law to the contrary
 
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
they can do what follows and what
 
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
follows is to hear these cases
 
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
and in two and in three uh how what
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
rules they have to follow
 
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
then after you've gotten the rid of
 
01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.729 align:start position:0%
then after you've gotten the rid of
those

01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
two phrase that same phrase twice
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
I would take things that involve real
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
crime like domestic violence I would
 
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
take them out of family court and put
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
them into District Court
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
equipped and organized to handle
 
01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
low level criminal cases
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I would create a system of laws and
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
family court
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
that says this is these are the types of
 
01:12:52.450 --> 01:12:52.460 align:start position:0%
evidence that are required
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
and uh I I will be happy to make sure
 
01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
some ideas get put in but
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's what you need to do you that you
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
have to take away the there are no rules
 
01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.070 align:start position:0%
have to take away the there are no rules
aspect

01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
you need to take account of what rules
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
court rules are being routinely or
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
capriciously discarded
 
01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
I mean if there's a rule that never gets
 
01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
if there's a rule that gets discarded
 
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
and set in a manner that it skews the
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
outcome of cases like the person for
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
whom it only always gets discarded is
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
always the person that wins
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
you need to do something about it
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
will you email us with the specifics uh
 
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
like on 490d2 and 3 and take crimes on a
 
01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
family court you're in your conclusion I
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate the history
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
background to this a lot of stuff I've
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
learned here today and now at the end of
 
01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
your testimony you're making
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations if you could email us I
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
would be honored to and would you take
 
01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.739 --> 01:14:15.290 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much and yeah
 
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
shoot this to us we are in the process
 
01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.970 align:start position:0%
shoot this to us we are in the process
of

01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
um coming up with i i liken it to
 
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
proto-planetary matter in the vast
 
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
universe that circles around planets
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
we're we're coming up with seven planets
 
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
sorry Neptune and Pluto um and getting
 
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
people assigned to those so we're taking
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
all of the stuff that's come in and
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
putting it in its proper place that's
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
that concludes our hearing of public
 
01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.890 align:start position:0%
that concludes our hearing of public
testimony

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:14:57.169 --> 01:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so much this was probably I
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
think about the best session we've ever
 
01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:01.930 align:start position:0%
think about the best session we've ever
had

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:01.940 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
I think the early people testify
 
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
but this this puts a cherry on the
 
01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:09.530 align:start position:0%
but this this puts a cherry on the
Sunday

01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
Sunday
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
now you're going to be punching up that
 
01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
thing for me here uh just a reminder to
 
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
everyone here the special committee
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
meets next on October 3rd 9 30 it will
 
01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
be a general work session I believe
 
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
um you all got an email or two from me
 
01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:35.750 align:start position:0%
um you all got an email or two from me
indicating

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
indicating
 
01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.430 align:start position:0%
indicating
um

01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
what those different topics will be this
 
01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean one might jump out at us in
 
01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
a few weeks and we realize oh we should
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
do that one but generally speaking I
 
01:15:50.090 --> 01:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
think we've got the general topics I've
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
also pretty much heard from you as to
 
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
what work groups you would like to be
 
01:15:58.610 --> 01:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
part of
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
some of these topics I think will be
 
01:16:03.649 --> 01:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
done very quickly some of them are going
 
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
to take quite a while
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
some of them I think again we will
 
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
simply be making recommendations to the
 
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
Judiciary System some of them we will be
 
01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
putting legislation in
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
and in terms of looks like this one will
 
01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:21.620 align:start position:0%
be legislation
 
01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
I have been told by the speaker
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
that in cases like special committees
 
01:16:29.159 --> 01:16:31.570 align:start position:0%
that in cases like special committees
the

01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:31.580 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
submission period for bills is extended
 
01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
we all know this is Bill submission week
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
but we will probably have six or eight
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
weeks more it will go to a committee of
 
01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
the house and they will decide whether
 
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
they'll let it in or not and the speaker
 
01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.689 align:start position:0%
they'll let it in or not and the speaker
said

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
most of the times they do because they
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
know this is this work product done here
 
01:16:59.810 --> 01:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
but if it does look like early November
 
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're just not there yet
 
01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
um we can wait I don't want bad stuff
 
01:17:05.219 --> 01:17:07.010 align:start position:0%
um we can wait I don't want bad stuff
done

01:17:07.010 --> 01:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:07.669 align:start position:0%
done
um

01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind could you uh slide
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
that um wonderful device over here
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair yes if I could while
 
01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.169 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair yes if I could while
you're

01:17:20.169 --> 01:17:20.179 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
organizing that I'd also like to point
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
out to the public that a number of bills
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
were filed
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
last this year and assigned to children
 
01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:36.980 align:start position:0%
and family law children and family law
 
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
retained those bills
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
and therefore still have to act on them
 
01:17:50.050 --> 01:17:50.060 align:start position:0%
and so those bills I as I understand
 
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
having the benefit of you sharing both
 
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
this committee and that will be reviewed
 
01:17:59.090 --> 01:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
by children and family law and any
 
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
number of them do address issues that
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
had been brought before us here
 
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
so those are on a slightly different
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
timeline children and family law will
 
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
look at them and get them in before
 
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving and with a final
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation for a vote and the full
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
house would be voting on them starting
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
in January so you have kind of three
 
01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.110 align:start position:0%
in January so you have kind of three
different

01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:26.120 align:start position:0%

01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
schedules for how these bills are going
 
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:31.980 align:start position:0%

01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
schedule for addressing Communications

much in the Wheelhouse of what we are
 
01:20:21.239 --> 01:20:22.070 align:start position:0%
much in the Wheelhouse of what we are
doing

01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%

that benefit of
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
um overlap so
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%

the record as well
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
we have one group
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
that will be looking at the Guardians at
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
Litem slash parenting coordinator role
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%

this mean somebody's moving
 
01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
and interestingly we will be looking at
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
that here
 
01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
but representative catab who I asked to
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
chair that group has also put an LSR in
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
so we're running in some parallel tracks
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
which can be a little confusing but I
 
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty helpful also
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:56.470 align:start position:0%
regarding domestic violence
um

01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
you agreed for a meeting between rep
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
Smith and Rhett Manos who's actually
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
from the Judiciary Committee and is also
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
a family law attorney so has
 
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:06.590 align:start position:0%
a family law attorney so has
um

01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
much background in some of this and so
 
01:26:13.129 --> 01:26:13.139 align:start position:0%
we'll be meeting to discuss what uh
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
we may be able to come up with and that
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
may end up turning into a subcommittee
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
of its own just like the child support
 
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
one may yes and I did put in um
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
so some of these I did go ahead and try
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
and do as much homework as I possibly
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
could just to put in some lsrs that I
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
thought were
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
based on a lot much of what we heard
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
um and they can absolutely I'm
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely open to amending them if we
 
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
come up with you know some changes that
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
we should
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
um make but I wanted to have us to have
 
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
a starting place because I recognize
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
that it's difficult uh
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
to put something together so I thought
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
it would be easier if we just had
 
01:26:55.729 --> 01:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
somewhere to stand this is why as a as
 
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
an example
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
um I would I held back one of the sununu
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
center bills simply in case we needed it
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
and you and I have the committee that's
 
01:27:08.209 --> 01:27:08.219 align:start position:0%
going to deal with that in about 12
 
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
seconds because it's not needed anymore
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
but had it been we had it in our hand
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
and we didn't have to get special waving
 
01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
of rules which plow ahead so that's what
 
01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
we've got here too if we wind up with
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
parallel tracks I hope they'll talk with
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
each other we may wind up saying okay we
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
don't really need all of this we won't
 
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
as a special committee put anything in
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
because we can put it in kind of any
 
01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:33.850 align:start position:0%
because we can put it in kind of any
time

01:27:33.850 --> 01:27:33.860 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
or what but it gives us more options uh
 
01:27:43.129 --> 01:27:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.169 --> 01:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
um so the neutral case evaluation
 
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
expansion that was already being
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
expanded so to all the courts so we
 
01:27:50.209 --> 01:27:50.219 align:start position:0%
didn't feel there was a need to do
 
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:51.900 align:start position:0%
anything with it
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
um equal parenting time there's the bill
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned House Bill 185 FM
 
01:27:59.209 --> 01:27:59.219 align:start position:0%
that's been retained you already told us
 
01:28:02.209 --> 01:28:02.219 align:start position:0%
the date that that meeting will be
 
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
um and then we didn't end up uh
 
01:28:08.209 --> 01:28:08.219 align:start position:0%
forming ignore these two because these
 
01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:09.719 align:start position:0%
are already up above we didn't end up
 
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
forming anything on timelines just
 
01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.610 align:start position:0%
forming anything on timelines just
because

01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
that really is a a court function and
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
there there have been a few
 
01:28:19.739 --> 01:28:20.930 align:start position:0%
there there have been a few
um

01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
cases where there's
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
you know limited amount of oversight
 
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
that we can give into the Judiciary but
 
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:29.219 align:start position:0%
also I think we need to to keep in mind
 
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
that when we put a timeline for
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
something it pushes a timeline for
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
something else so they can only fit in
 
01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
certain number of cases in a certain
 
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
amount of days so for now
 
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
we were holding off of the real way to
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
address this is more judges and we've
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
put seven in the budget for this
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
two-year cycle that's a third of what an
 
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
evaluative committee came up with
 
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
um I am hoping that in the next budget
 
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
we'll have at least seven additional
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
that's what will eliminate the Log Jam
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
I think these are these are going to be
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations but no committees like
 
01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
recommendations from our report all
 
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
right go up one
 
01:29:09.649 --> 01:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
so this one you can ignore oh no where's
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
the other one
 
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
um it was one I liked that I had that
 
01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
seven but that is a thing on here oh
 
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
that's already up there oh yeah okay
 
01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought that was familiar yeah
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
all right anybody here
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
um on the special committee who's
 
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
interested in jumping into any of the
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
work groups
 
01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.570 align:start position:0%
work groups
um

01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
or the ones that are not likely to be
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
legislative but probably recommending
 
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
things uh jump into that discussion if
 
01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:45.719 align:start position:0%

01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
