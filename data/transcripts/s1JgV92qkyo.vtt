00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
hello I'm going to uh open the
 
00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on Senate Bill
 
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
149 related relative to a nurse agency
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
I know how many people are here for that
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
or the next one but um
 
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
but we'll proceed I know Jackie said you
 
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm torn between
 
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.070 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm torn between
um

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.380 align:start position:0%
putting too much
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
too many mandates in the bill
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm more interested in getting
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
something started
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
so my thoughts were that
 
00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
um there's one one there's a page two
 
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
which I can't find my bill right now has
 
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.550 align:start position:0%
which I can't find my bill right now has
um online

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
eight to nine I thought if we struck out
 
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
for such a reason
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
which regarded the commitment of nursing
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
agencies making
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
um commitments to two places at once
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
just eliminating for such a reason would
 
00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:24.419 align:start position:0%
give that class more strength those are
 
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
the those are the comments that I had on
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
that actually I agree because reading it
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
it isn't really
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
um it isn't listing any reasons in in
 
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
that section nurse agencies shall not
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
commit the services anyway it goes on
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
and there aren't any reasons listed and
 
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.419 align:start position:0%
then it says for such a reason which I
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
think basically doesn't make any sense
 
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.630 align:start position:0%
think basically doesn't make any sense
um

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
I mean two the not recruiting employees
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
on the premises I don't know how and how
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
useful or enforceable that'll be but
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.009 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
you know nursing agencies not may not
 
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
facilitate the placement of any licensed
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
professional to license the suspended I
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
mean that's actually not legal
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
but I understand uh these nurses are are
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
not necessarily licensed in New
 
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it might be tricky to
 
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
figure that out
 
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.530 align:start position:0%
figure that out
um

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
and when I have the other one I have
 
00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
concern about is Nurse agencies may not
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
charge a higher uh a health care
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
facility a higher amount based on the
 
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
presence of a communicable virus unless
 
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
I mean the one hand maybe that's a
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
normal part of the job on the other hand
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
depending on what it is I mean I might
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
not be widespread enough to have
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
generated a state of emergency but
 
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
the agency might actually have to pay
 
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
more to hire people to show up and if
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
they do they should be able to pass that
 
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
on so
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
I do have something of a concern about
 
00:09:59.930 --> 00:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
that any other anybody else in the
 
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
committee have uh thoughts on any of
 
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:07.870 align:start position:0%
committee have uh thoughts on any of
this

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.550 align:start position:0%
 
week

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
but that I mean that yeah that happened
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
with covert I mean that would be up to
 
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
presumably the contract between the
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
nursing agency and the nurse but that
 
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
could increase their costs so that's the
 
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
sort of thing I was thinking about
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
anyone else have thoughts on anything in
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
I will just look at um
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
as we look at these bills the effective
 
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
date is 60 days upon passage and I look
 
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
to the director
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
about is it better to put where
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
none of this takes effect if you look on
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
page one line 18 uh
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
16 beginning January 1st 2024 should we
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
put this actual take effect at that date
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
as well or is it 60 days is that to get
 
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
you up and running and get rules and all
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
that in place director Courtney if you
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question Lindsey Courtney
 
00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:14.579 align:start position:0%
executive director oplc I think making
 
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
it effective 60 days
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
um is appropriate because it would allow
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
us to enact rules and then subsequently
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
require people to meet that standard
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
okay actually if you could uh stay up
 
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.030 align:start position:0%
okay actually if you could uh stay up
there

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.810 align:start position:0%
there
thanks

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
so I mean do you have any
 
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.329 align:start position:0%
so I mean do you have any
um

00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the issue I raised about
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
being able to charge a higher amount
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
based on a communicable disease
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
because I know in covid
 
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.190 align:start position:0%
because I know in covid
um

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
actually I got a bunch of sisters in the
 
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
health facility Healthcare business and
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
in covet although that was a state of
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
emergency something might have similar
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
issues that wasn't widespread to have
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
had an emergency declared
 
00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:05.459 align:start position:0%
they were paying people a lot of money
 
00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:06.410 align:start position:0%
they were paying people a lot of money
to

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:08.459 align:start position:0%
to work somewhere else and part of the
 
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
deal was they'd have to put you up in a
 
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
hotel for 10 days or whatever afterwards
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
in quarantine before you went home I
 
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
mean that's a significant expense they'd
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
have to recoup somehow and I could see
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
that happen in other circumstances or
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
who knows what so I don't know what your
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
I just think generally it's pretty
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to legislate
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not taking a position on this
 
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
bill but I think it's pretty difficult
 
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:36.610 align:start position:0%
to legislate
um

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:36.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
reimbursement or costs of salaries
 
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
essentially because the market
 
00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:46.019 align:start position:0%
consistently fluctuates
 
00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:47.389 align:start position:0%
consistently fluctuates
um

00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure that legislation would
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
be the best route for that but we we
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
don't take a position okay
 
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.990 align:start position:0%
don't take a position okay
um

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:59.449 --> 00:12:59.459 align:start position:0%
the other question I have is on the
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
nursing agencies may not facilitate the
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
placement of a licensed professional
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
with a license that's suspended
 
00:13:09.069 --> 00:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
I mean as a practical matter how would
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
the office do you think become aware of
 
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
it and then and what could they do then
 
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:18.380 align:start position:0%
so typically when a license is suspended
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
every nursing facility is or is is
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
typically required to
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
um check the status of of a particular
 
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
license as part of their accreditation
 
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:32.339 align:start position:0%
so some facilities do that on a regular
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
basis some facilities contract that out
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
and they get notices that an individual
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
has been suspended but typically as part
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
of the credentialing and hiring process
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
one would um
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
check the status of a license and uh
 
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
that's our so that's already happening
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if this is different
 
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
because they're high they're having the
 
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
agency place them they don't even know
 
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
who it's going to be maybe until they
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
show up and the license is likely not a
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire license so how would that
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
work so to work here you'd have to be
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
licensed in New Hampshire whether it be
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
under a compact or a temporary license I
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
read this to say that the nursing
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
agencies themselves have to validate the
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
license prior to placement okay so they
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
would have to have some kind of New
 
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license for this yes yes
 
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
whether it be temporary or compact or
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
otherwise authorized practice okay great
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any questions for
 
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
so Jackie are you all all sad or you
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
have any anything else on this
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
um is there anyone else here for this
 
00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.189 align:start position:0%
um is there anyone else here for this
bill

00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
if you can uh give me your name good
 
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Lynette Han Shoemaker
 
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
uh if you can spell that
 
00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:28.009 align:start position:0%
uh if you can spell that
h-a-n-d-s-c-h-u-m-a-k-e-r

00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:28.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and that's the spelling
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
lesson for the day
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
well people have come to this country
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
from all over the place with various
 
00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:44.339 align:start position:0%
spellings I people have trouble with
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
mine I want to get it right so
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
well good morning and I thank you for
 
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
allowing me a few moments of your time
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
I am the president and CEO of Evergreen
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
Place in Manchester New Hampshire we are
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
a smaller non-profit assisted living
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
community that provides services to 52
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
elderly residents here in New Hampshire
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
I'm writing in I'm here in support of
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
the bill Senate Bill 149 in the hope
 
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
that we can apply some reasonable
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
standards to staffing agencies
 
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:24.380 align:start position:0%
I employ
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
approximately 32 full-time equivalent
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
employees many of whom are part-time
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
and since the pandemic like many other
 
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
Healthcare communities we've been
 
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.009 align:start position:0%
Healthcare communities we've been
understaffed

00:16:39.009 --> 00:16:39.019 align:start position:0%
understaffed
 
00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
in order to meet our requirements under
 
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:44.420 align:start position:0%
our regulations
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
we use staffing agencies to fill
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
vacancies as well as last minute call
 
00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.670 align:start position:0%
vacancies as well as last minute call
outs

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
outs
 
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.449 align:start position:0%
outs
um

00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:53.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
in addition to the exorbitant cost we've
 
00:16:59.170 --> 00:16:59.180 align:start position:0%
had to absorb
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
we do have concerns about staffing
 
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:05.660 align:start position:0%
agency practices
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
for my organization
 
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
we absorbed about 79
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
000 in additional expense due to Hiring
 
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:21.020 align:start position:0%
Agency to either fill vacant
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
openings or last minute call outs so I
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
can tell you that this is extremely
 
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
damaging to our bottom line especially
 
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
in respect to the fact that I hold 20
 
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.990 align:start position:0%
in respect to the fact that I hold 20
Medicaid

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
beds in my community which
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
basically states that even if an
 
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
individual coming into my community can
 
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
pay eight hundred dollars a month
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
with the stipend that I'm given through
 
00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
the choices for Independence
 
00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:56.330 align:start position:0%
the choices for Independence
um

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
of 56.88 a day I am falling very short
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
of being able to
 
00:18:03.419 --> 00:18:04.310 align:start position:0%
of being able to
um

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.470 align:start position:0%
um
meet

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
meet
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
the growth
 
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:12.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.450 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.409 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
the expense of having agencies work in
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.020 align:start position:0%
threatens our financial viability
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
especially since we have not reached
 
00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:34.039 align:start position:0%
full occupancy since the pandemic
 
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:37.100 align:start position:0%
to give you a better idea
 
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies can oftentimes cost us
 
00:18:44.049 --> 00:18:44.059 align:start position:0%
three to four times the cost of what is
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
a normal wage for our nurses and aides
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I think sorry for interrupting
 
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
but yeah we're
 
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
it's not a public hearing we're our
 
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
interests in comments but I have one
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
question then for you about this
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
um I mean I could see this bill if it
 
00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:03.419 align:start position:0%
went through my
 
00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:06.860 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of kind of last minute
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
uncertainty around what the cost will be
 
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.669 align:start position:0%
uncertainty around what the cost will be
um

00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing here that I see
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's going to actually reduce your
 
00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
cost there's nothing I mean if you if
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
you can't find nurses some other way
 
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
you're presumably going to have to get
 
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
them through an agency and they can
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
charge whatever they can get
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
so I don't see that in a major way this
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
is going to help your bottom line is
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
there something I'm missing there well
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
it isn't going to help my bottom line
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right however being
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
able to have some reasonable standards
 
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
in place which is what this bill is
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
laying out for us as a whole would go a
 
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
long way toward helping our
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
organizations in particular
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
items that are not part of contracts
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
that we sign when doing business with
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
agencies such as the 20 to 40 dollar per
 
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
hour covid surcharge that is being put
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
upon agent organizations other assisted
 
00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:15.740 align:start position:0%
living communities that have outbreaks
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
is one way to
 
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
um to help us financially all right
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
we also please representative
 
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
so what is it that prevents you from
 
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.390 align:start position:0%
so what is it that prevents you from
putting

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
putting
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
um limitations in your contracts with
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
the agencies for example
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
to say that we won't you know that we
 
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
will pay up to blank an hour for nursing
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
or why why is there something that you
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
can do within your
 
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.490 align:start position:0%
can do within your
um

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.990 align:start position:0%
um
contract

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
make the payment of nursing nurses more
 
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.230 align:start position:0%
make the payment of nursing nurses more
predictable

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
predictable
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
or more you know allow you for a better
 
00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:06.059 align:start position:0%
budgeting I'm sure that's
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
that's a viable question and it's a
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
possibility I think what we're aiming
 
00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
for here is sort of a standard or a
 
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
number of standards that we can put
 
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
forth that will affect all of us at the
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:24.169 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
so I know that in Hillsboro what they've
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
done is they've I believe this is in
 
00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:29.570 align:start position:0%
done is they've I believe this is in
Hillsboro

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro
 
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
counties it's one of the nursing homes
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes they've put a limit
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
like say that we will not take traveling
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
nurses that are within a 50 mile radius
 
00:21:44.409 --> 00:21:44.419 align:start position:0%
of our facility which prevents
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh nurses that live nearby from
 
00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:51.539 align:start position:0%
hopping from one place to the other and
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
bidding out their services do you see
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
that perhaps as an effective tool you
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
know traveling distance so that people
 
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.669 align:start position:0%
know traveling distance so that people
who

00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
um it limits who's available and who's
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
uh that might be one way of of
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
addressing this I don't know
 
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.059 align:start position:0%
I don't work for a nursing home I don't
 
00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
work with travel nurse agencies what I'm
 
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:23.780 align:start position:0%
talking about has more to do with local
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
nurse temporary nurse staffing agencies
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
where nurses will come in and I might
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
block book them for a number of days
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
over a month but they're not necessarily
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
these are not people that are traveling
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
across the state or coming from
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
longer distances someone else may be
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
able to speak to that
 
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.549 align:start position:0%
able to speak to that
okay

00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:51.049 align:start position:0%
anything else
yep

00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
um representative Bailey
 
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned a 20 to 40 dollar an
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
hour I presume uh covid surcharge did
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
they explain that to you in any way or
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
justify it or no and I think the the
 
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
bone of contention for us is simply that
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
if these items are not listed in our
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
contract then why should we have to pay
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
them they're showing up on our invoices
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and they're not necessarily part of
 
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
the contract
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
language when we initiate a contract
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
with an agency so it seems a little
 
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
backhanded if you will
 
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
um that you know that charge along with
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
a last minute fee when you know things
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
happen and you have a call out and the
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
last minute you're looking for an agency
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
person to come and do the nursing duties
 
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
because it's a requirement in order for
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
us to maintain our license
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
um charging us for those
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
types of things can be a little bit
 
00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.190 align:start position:0%
types of things can be a little bit
daunting

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
daunting
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's taken aback because it's not part
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:06.539 align:start position:0%
and if they rewrote all their contracts
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
have having experienced these epidemic
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
or pandemic or whatever if they then
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
just rewrote all the contracts that
 
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
you know if there was such a thing we
 
00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:21.539 align:start position:0%
will be charging this then it would be
 
00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
in your contract correct
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you right and actually as uh
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
representative groda said it sounds like
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't know if it's valid for
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
them to be charging something that
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the agreement
 
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
um if nothing else when you did the
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
contract you could do something like
 
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
you're not going to pay anything that's
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
not explicitly in the contract which
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully would take care of that I mean
 
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
my they might choose if you want to do
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
that not to take
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
not to bid on it I suppose but um
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
but if you could get someone to do it it
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
would sound like that's the sort of
 
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.130 align:start position:0%
would sound like that's the sort of
thing

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
you know almost might be more effective
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.049 --> 00:25:06.059 align:start position:0%
and you know because
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
surprise charges that aren't in the
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
agreement don't seem right and if you
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
say you're not going to pay them up
 
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
front then it could protect you from
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
things Beyond just what's covered in
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
this bill so it's just a thought so
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
there was someone else who wanted to
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
speak thank you somebody else want to
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
speak on this Mr chairman if I may just
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
briefly I mean I'm not sure
 
00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:29.409 align:start position:0%
briefly I mean I'm not sure
foreign

00:25:29.409 --> 00:25:29.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is looking to solve a sort of
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
a problem but this committee is not
 
00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
going to be able to solve a breach of
 
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
contract or something that's not written
 
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
at a contract right I understand I'm
 
00:25:42.049 --> 00:25:42.059 align:start position:0%
just I'm I guess what I'm trying to
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
figure out is um
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a perception that this
 
00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
will solve problems that it doesn't
 
00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539 align:start position:0%
appear it will so if I may fall I I
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
think it will help because we heard
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
specifically of examples if you look on
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
page two starting at line five this was
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
an area that was specifically mentioned
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
time and again that these
 
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
companies were
 
00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:09.539 align:start position:0%
moving nurses around from place to place
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
based on a higher bid qualification and
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
I think that will solve that alone will
 
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
solve a problem with the numerous
 
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
agencies said was happening right it
 
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
will certainly help
 
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.610 align:start position:0%
will certainly help
um

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
yeah that's
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
questionably because we we heard that
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
they were having to hold over staff and
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
paying you know time and a half or
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
paying whatever they had to and forcing
 
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
folks to work beyond the hours they
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
should because someone wasn't coming in
 
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:34.980 align:start position:0%
to fill a position
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
no I understand okay
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
um just
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
want to see if there's anything new that
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm not sure if
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
it's new or useful but I'm Brandon
 
00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:54.299 align:start position:0%
Williams I'm the president CEO of the
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Healthcare Association we
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
represent assisted living facilities
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
nursing homes Cedar Crest Center for
 
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities we've already
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
testified and supported this legislation
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
I won't make any uh policy arguments in
 
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
favor of it to avoid redundancy however
 
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
just in response to this hearing and
 
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
some of the questions asked
 
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
I think with respect to the up charge
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
for the presence of a communicable virus
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
within the facilities I know in talking
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
with the owner of a New Hampshire
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
staffing agency that was something that
 
00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:33.779 align:start position:0%
he never charged I didn't think it would
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
be right to charge even during the real
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
depths of the covid-19 pandemic because
 
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:42.539 align:start position:0%
that's why uh personal protective
 
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
equipment exists and that is something
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
that the facilities themselves provide
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
to the contract staff that come into the
 
00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:51.049 align:start position:0%
to the contract staff that come into the
facility

00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:27:51.059 --> 00:27:51.710 align:start position:0%
facility
um

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
because we don't have transparency as to
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
the rates as does Massachusetts which
 
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
actually caps the rates or as to the
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
elements of the rates is a number of
 
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
other states require Connecticut Iowa
 
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
Missouri being a few examples we don't
 
00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
really know exactly what the elements of
 
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
the rates are so there could be some
 
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:15.419 align:start position:0%
consideration for the fact that there's
 
00:28:18.409 --> 00:28:18.419 align:start position:0%
an ongoing pandemic I think what really
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
calls providers is just that there be a
 
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
discrete up charge for the presence
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
again of a communicable virus and so I
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
think this prohibition is reasonable
 
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:30.710 align:start position:0%
think this prohibition is reasonable
um

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
as to the question of whether you can
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
make the contracts more predictable we
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
did discuss this at the hearing on the
 
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
bill that these are really contracts of
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
adhesion arguably but at a minimum I
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone could disagree that
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
their boilerplate contracts uh when you
 
00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
get these National staffing agencies for
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
example career staff which is
 
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
headquartered in Dallas Texas they're
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
not tailoring these kind these contracts
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
are not up for negotiation in terms of
 
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
the elements of the contracts these
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
contracts are works of art when it comes
 
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
to the legal work that has gone into
 
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
them and so a facility that's looking to
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
uh fill a shift tomorrow evening
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have the ability to negotiate
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
the elements of that contract so
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
um I think otherwise the only comment
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
that I would make is I know and director
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
Courtney could speak to this uh that the
 
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
statutory reference should probably be
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
changed here to an open statute and
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
again I would leave it to director
 
00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
Courtney to say what that is although I
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
think RSA 326 M was O as opposed
 
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
most of the references that we see
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
within the bill to RSA 326 B uh I think
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
it would be a better place to in the
 
00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
open statute and uh with that I'd
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
certainly take any questions but I
 
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your time on this
 
00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
beautiful day can you give me your name
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
again please my name is Brendan Williams
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm the president of the New
 
00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:09.539 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Healthcare Association okay
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
director Courtney if you're still here
 
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
if you want to see what she went out all
 
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
right well
 
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.769 align:start position:0%
right well
um

00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
you know what I just do want to make it
 
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
clear to everyone that this is due with
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
nursing agencies right and if you don't
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
work with nursing agencies this this
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
bill that doesn't apply to you
 
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make that perfectly
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
clear and
 
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I am okay with recommending to the
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
committee that we if we we wanted to
 
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
discuss I think that the
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
the changes that
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
um the elimination of four
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh these reasons are and then also I
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
think we need to assess out a little bit
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
that clause about the up charge because
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
to me it's not clear
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's not well defined what that means so
 
00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
we might most want to strike that from
 
00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.549 align:start position:0%
we might most want to strike that from
the

00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
um the bill because
 
00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:18.299 align:start position:0%
you know the flu is a communicable
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
disease and so to me if a facility has
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
the flu
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be an up charge for that
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to me
 
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
so if we can't define it
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think it should be in the
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
legislation right I agree I mean the
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
only uh reason I would
 
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
mean if we do those two things I would
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
be fine with it my only
 
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
quash at this point is the comment about
 
00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
where it is in statute and we might want
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
to check with director Courtney to see
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
if although was she involved in
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
recommending this
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
let me check my notes on that but um we
 
00:31:57.409 --> 00:31:57.419 align:start position:0%
have the attorney from ah oplc here that
 
00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
may be able to
 
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
good morning Douglas selster how oplc
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
general counsel I'm not going to be much
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
help here that was executive director
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
Corey's comment uh I wasn't consulted
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
about that I think if it clarifies
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
the language and it makes more sense to
 
00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:21.419 align:start position:0%
put it in the open statue
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
when you said it's her comment so did
 
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
she say something about moving I don't
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
recall that I don't either that was the
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
testimony I just heard I would have to
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
confirm with her before
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
okay I say anything no there were no
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
no she didn't mention
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
something about there was I'm so sorry
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
there was something I have a note about
 
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
RSA 326.
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
and that this should go into it should
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
not go into RSA 326 is that the RSA
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
that's referred to in the bill
 
00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.269 align:start position:0%
that's referred to in the bill
um

00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
B right instead of two line five
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
actually a number of places 326. right
 
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
so I have this and that was the comment
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
that director Courtney made
 
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
um I had this little tiny so I would
 
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
think that we need to just make sure
 
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.789 align:start position:0%
think that we need to just make sure
that

00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:17.630 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
we addressed that with her before we
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
write an amendment
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
so unless there's anything else
 
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I'll just close this and we'll have
 
00:33:30.649 --> 00:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
to get in touch with her I don't know if
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
she's going to be here for the latter
 
00:33:33.409 --> 00:33:33.419 align:start position:0%
part of this but she is coming for the
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
second half so we'll be able to talk
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm David Ross I'm the
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
administrator of Hillsborough County
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
nursing home I just wanted to speak to
 
00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:51.059 align:start position:0%
um I believe I heard you recommend that
 
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
you would like to strike uh Article 4
 
00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.549 align:start position:0%
you would like to strike uh Article 4
which

00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
um excuse me the article related to a
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
um what the article currently says is
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
that they may not charge an up charge
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
for a communicable disease unless there
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
is a declaration of state of emergency
 
00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:12.419 align:start position:0%
and I would urge you to support that so
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't apply in the case of flu or
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
other communicable diseases it would
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
only apply that they would be able to
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
charge an up charge in the event that it
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
was a pandemic level that warranted a
 
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
declaration of state of emergency well I
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
think I mean
 
00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it would apply if it was
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
the flu and there's not a state of
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
emergency because they may not charge in
 
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
that case so
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
it sort of seems the other way around at
 
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
least in my reading depends how you look
 
00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
at it but but this appla this prohibits
 
00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:44.750 align:start position:0%
at it but but this appla this prohibits
something

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
unless unless right unless okay yeah it
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
prohibits the up charge unless there's a
 
00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
declaration all right thank you thank
 
00:34:51.899 --> 00:34:55.629 align:start position:0%
declaration all right thank you thank
you

00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
I mean I'll think about that but so we
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%

00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
anyway so does anybody else have
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%

any questions all right thank you thank
you

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:09.849 align:start position:0%
 
actually

00:36:09.849 --> 00:36:09.859 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
no I don't have a question I think the
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
comment that he makes is valid and I'm
 
00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
wondering whether or not that's
 
00:36:17.569 --> 00:36:17.579 align:start position:0%
something that we can refer to in
 
00:36:17.579 --> 00:36:18.589 align:start position:0%
something that we can refer to in
statute

00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
right that we can tie this to the
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office statutes on
 
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
contract that those things apply
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
I don't have any problem with that I
 
00:36:31.849 --> 00:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
it's sort of well I know that it's sort
 
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
of like it already exists but I think
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
that it's okay yeah I would I would
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
discuss that maybe do you have a comment
 
00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:41.099 align:start position:0%
on that attorney Astra hubbed Hound I
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
did just run next door and ask Lindsay
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
and she said she does agree with the
 
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
move to 326m
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to share that she wants to
 
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
she wants it in 326. I believe so m m
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you so
 
00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.849 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you so
um

00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
I mean there's references to various
 
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
parts of 326 B
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
or is this all it's all new
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
um so this would you just want to move
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
it to wherever the the end of 326m
 
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
correct that's what she wants all right
 
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
anything else I'm ready to close things
 
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.109 align:start position:0%
anything else I'm ready to close things
out

00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
okay I'm closing the uh subcommittee
 
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
work session on Senate Bill 149 and
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to start up again at 11
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.720 --> 01:06:02.329 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:02.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to open the this discussion
 
01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
I'm merging to mental health boards and
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
social worker Compact and I want to
 
01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
explain how this works and set
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
expectations this is not a public
 
01:06:13.319 --> 01:06:15.230 align:start position:0%
expectations this is not a public
hearing

01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
um my intent is that this is going to be
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
mostly if not entirely a discussion
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
between members of the committee and and
 
01:06:24.829 --> 01:06:24.839 align:start position:0%
director Courtney if we have questions
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
we think there's somebody here can
 
01:06:26.039 --> 01:06:26.930 align:start position:0%
we think there's somebody here can
answer

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
will ask if eventually what comes out of
 
01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
this you know in the future is some kind
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
of legislation I mean that would then
 
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing so that's to make
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
um so director Courtney if you could
 
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
what I was uh
 
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
planning on doing is
 
01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:56.029 align:start position:0%
planning on doing is
um

01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
I mean if you could talk about what what
 
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
the goal was what the plans were on the
 
01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
part of the original hb2
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with mental health practice I
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
think in the original bill it starts on
 
01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:09.299 align:start position:0%
page 160
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.839 --> 01:07:13.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:15.849 --> 01:07:15.859 align:start position:0%
I think the end of the
 
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
181 and anybody I mean you know we're
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
not going to be real formal here if
 
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
anybody on the committee has a question
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Representative members of the
 
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:31.140 align:start position:0%
committee executive director Lindsey
 
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
Courtney oplc um so I think I can speak
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
to further Governor obviously but I
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
think the whole purpose of what was
 
01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
proposed in House Bill 2 is really to
 
01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
reduce uh bureaucracy
 
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
um reduce uh the number of boards reduce
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
the number of board members we have
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
currently about 350 within the office
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
most boards have a structure that are
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
around seven members each with two
 
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
public members public member positions
 
01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
are extremely difficult to fill so you
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
could see throughout hb2 that I think
 
01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
the goal was to reduce moose boards to
 
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
five with one public member with respect
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
to the mental health boards what was
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
proposed in House Bill 2 was really just
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
to merge the number of boards to go from
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
27 members I think down to seven is what
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
was originally how many
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
um separate boards exist today in the
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
mental health practice area well so
 
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
there are five boards that regulate to
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
some extent
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
mental health providers that being Board
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
of Medicine Board of Nursing
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
Board of Licensing for Alcohol and Other
 
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
Drug use counselors on the board of
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
mental health practice and the board of
 
01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.450 align:start position:0%
mental health practice and the board of
psychology

01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
psychology
 
01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
so what House Bill 2 proposed is to
 
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
merge the latter three which psychology
 
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
but within those boards there are
 
01:09:00.839 --> 01:09:02.510 align:start position:0%
but within those boards there are
separate

01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
there are separate so how many of these
 
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
if you look at the last the last three
 
01:09:10.849 --> 01:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
boards that you talked about how many
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
members are there on that board on those
 
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.410 align:start position:0%
members are there on that board on those
boards

01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
oh geez I don't know that off the top of
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
my head representative there's 27
 
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
members across the three of them
 
01:09:23.219 --> 01:09:24.169 align:start position:0%
members across the three of them
um

01:09:24.169 --> 01:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
I know that there are folks here who
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
could better answer that question off
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
the top of your head I'd have to look at
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
the statute which I'm more than happy to
 
01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.470 align:start position:0%
the statute which I'm more than happy to
do

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
but really that number is irrelevant if
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about three you know
 
01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
you see what I mean right
 
01:09:39.169 --> 01:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:09:39.179 --> 01:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
and then
um

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
there are things that there are boards
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
that are functioning better than others
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
so I do want to have that conversation
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
these are the things that I think we
 
01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.970 align:start position:0%
these are the things that I think we
should

01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
um talk about is exactly how many
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
members are in total of the board on the
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
board that we're talking about merging
 
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
or that gets reduced to
 
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
and how we
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
and then and then also
 
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
um the functionality of these boards
 
01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.189 align:start position:0%
um the functionality of these boards
because

01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
if they have strong representation
 
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
they are experts in those fields am I
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
concerned with merging boards that have
 
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
these kinds of specialties
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
is that we get to the lowest common
 
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
denominator where we lose that
 
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
that uniqueness and understanding of
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
that field and since mental health is
 
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
such an important field right now
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
I don't want to complicate it or or
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
nullify its meanings when you're looking
 
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
at special practices
 
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
certainly so just to take the board of
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
psychology for example their their board
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
is currently comprised of five licensed
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
psychologists one licensed School
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
psychologists and three public members
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
um we currently have one public member
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
seat filled again historically the
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
public member seats are very difficult
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
to fill the requirement to have a
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
licensed school psychologist dates back
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
to March 2020 we just recently filled
 
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
that one and then the other five
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
psychologist seats are presently filled
 
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
and they function they meet every month
 
01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:30.830 align:start position:0%
and they function they meet every month
um

01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:33.169 --> 01:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
so certainly they're they're not having
 
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
the Quorum issues that we've seen with
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
respect to other boards I think the same
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
is true for the laidac board as well as
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
the board of mental health practice
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're not seeing Quorum issues I will
 
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
say with respect to the board of mental
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
health practice
 
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
we do run into issues because they have
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
very specific requirements as to
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
um the composition of the board in
 
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
particular they have to have one
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
licensed pastoral psychotherapist that
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
one is presently filled it has been
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
filled for a while but I think there are
 
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
only 11 licensed pastoral
 
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
psychotherapists in the state one
 
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
licensed clinical social worker that's
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
filled one licensed School social worker
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
that one historically has been somewhat
 
01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:19.940 align:start position:0%
difficult to fill
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
I think mainly because they're working
 
01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
in education environments a licensed
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
marriage and family therapist a licensed
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
clinical mental health counselor and
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
then the next two are historically
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
pretty difficult to fill one has to be a
 
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
member from a Community Mental Health
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
Center and one has to be a member from a
 
01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
community health center
 
01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
and those had those were recent
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
additions I think day back to 2020 as
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
well those are historically are very
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
difficult to fill and then they also
 
01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
have a three public member requirement
 
01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:54.179 align:start position:0%
and again public members are very
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
difficult to fill so how do sorry how do
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
public how are public members
 
01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
um how do you work and how do you
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
advertise to those and who appoints
 
01:13:04.729 --> 01:13:04.739 align:start position:0%
those and how do they get placed on
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
board so most of them are gnca governor
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
and Council appointments
 
01:13:11.649 --> 01:13:11.659 align:start position:0%
um a lot of it is done by Word of Mouth
 
01:13:14.209 --> 01:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
historically we had placed ads in the
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
bar news seeking attorneys
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
um but because we typically Market
 
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
because most of our positions are filled
 
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
by less licensed professionals we send
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
out Mass messages to licensees but they
 
01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:30.380 align:start position:0%
can't serve the public member position
 
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
and I think that's part of the problem
 
01:13:35.209 --> 01:13:35.219 align:start position:0%
we haven't figured out how to connect to
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
a market of individuals who may be
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
interested in serving and oftentimes
 
01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
public members have a particular
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
interest in a field and so they may seek
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
out a membership on a board based on
 
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
their subject matter interest and
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
they're really we just have we just have
 
01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
not been able to figure that out and be
 
01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
successful follow-up so what is the
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
benefit of having a public member on the
 
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:00.770 align:start position:0%
benefit of having a public member on the
board

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
I mean if it were up to me I think one
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
of the the state could consider if it
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
would work which it wouldn't
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
um for the reasons I just mentioned but
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
public member provides uh the public
 
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
input if the whole purpose is to protect
 
01:14:15.729 --> 01:14:15.739 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
obviously you need input from the public
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
it also if to the extent that you have
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
more public members on a board
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
um than uh licensed professionals it
 
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
provides that protection that immunity
 
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about under North
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
Carolina Dental because the board or the
 
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
profession is not regulated by a
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
majority of active Market participants
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
so some states actually have public
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
member majorities
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
and that has been something that has
 
01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
been presented as an option for
 
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
regulation and various audits but I
 
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
don't practically think that would be
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
successful here because we can't even
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
fill the seats that we have
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
um one thing I know as you said there's
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
other uh states where they you know they
 
01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
may have a majority of public members do
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
you have any idea how they're recruiting
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
public members I don't but I do think
 
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's an Avenue that we should look at
 
01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.709 align:start position:0%
that's an Avenue that we should look at
yeah

01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:15:14.689 --> 01:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chair Miss Courtney
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
um if
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
have you reached out to groups like Nami
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh there are there are a lot of support
 
01:15:25.209 --> 01:15:25.219 align:start position:0%
groups for families of
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
patients of clients that I know would be
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
interested I know would I know you would
 
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
get responses so I'm wondering if that's
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'm sure that's just one of
 
01:15:38.169 --> 01:15:38.179 align:start position:0%
many family
 
01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
support organizations in the state
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so we we do work regularly with
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
associations to get out the word
 
01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
um with respect to there are a lot of
 
01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
statutory prohibitions on having
 
01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
involvement with associations and being
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
considered a public member as well that
 
01:15:58.610 --> 01:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
one has to consider for example
 
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
unrelated here Pharmacy
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
um you know you can't have any interest
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
in the practice or the provision of
 
01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy whatsoever or some statutes
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
prohibit you from being married to
 
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
somebody with that interest so it
 
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
significantly Narrows the pool but yeah
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
we do work with associations follow-up
 
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
well my my recommendation of them was
 
01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
not that you would have like a Nami
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
worker but that they know how to contact
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
the public members I I guarantee you
 
01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:33.659 align:start position:0%
there are many many many many many many
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
many many many many
 
01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:40.739 align:start position:0%
of us who would love to have a voice and
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
certainly broken system and have never
 
01:16:44.159 --> 01:16:45.470 align:start position:0%
certainly broken system and have never
been

01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
aware that there were even opportunities
 
01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
like this so I think that those
 
01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
organizations know how to reach out to
 
01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
the general public that does not present
 
01:16:58.729 --> 01:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest certainly
 
01:16:58.739 --> 01:17:01.970 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest certainly
right

01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
um so you mentioned the three that hb2
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
is looking to combine it please remind
 
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
me what are the other two you said there
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
were five yeah so the others are Board
 
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
of Medicine they regulate psychiatrists
 
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
and then Board of Nursing aprns or
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
advanced practice
 
01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:18.890 align:start position:0%
advanced practice
um

01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
registered nurses
 
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
I I have a question I have a suggestion
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
yes so I'm thinking that what we might
 
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
do is look at these three boards
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
look at the compositions of them
 
01:17:35.649 --> 01:17:35.659 align:start position:0%
make them more functional
 
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
and see where that takes us because
 
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
if for example
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
um I looked at the psychologist board
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
and they record they regulate three
 
01:17:49.689 --> 01:17:49.699 align:start position:0%
different practices
 
01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
and if to me
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
it seems heavy-handed to have three
 
01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
public members on a board
 
01:17:59.689 --> 01:17:59.699 align:start position:0%
um I don't know you know there's five
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
psychologists one school psychologist
 
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if we could or is is it
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
possible here's the other
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
idea is it possible that these
 
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
um members are
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
chosen by someone other than appointed
 
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
by someone other than the executive
 
01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:22.310 align:start position:0%
by someone other than the executive
Council

01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
Council
 
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
is there some way that because to me
 
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
that seems like a huge hurdle right you
 
01:18:30.649 --> 01:18:30.659 align:start position:0%
have to the governor they have to find
 
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
somebody they have to appoint them they
 
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
have to vote them in blah blah blah it
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
takes away I think the role that the
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
public member is supposed to have
 
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
because a lot you know it could be that
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
these people have and I'm just looking
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
into this I'm just this is something I
 
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
thought of
 
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
um because of all the to-do lists of the
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
executive Council I don't think that
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
this is at the top right they're going
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
to be a appointing other things like
 
01:18:59.229 --> 01:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
judges or
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or something so is there
 
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
another vehicle other than not that I
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
want to step on the governor's toes
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know God knows we don't want to do
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
that but we don't want to um also impede
 
01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
public perception I mean if I wanted to
 
01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
be involved and bored I'm thinking of
 
01:19:18.179 --> 01:19:19.370 align:start position:0%
be involved and bored I'm thinking of
myself

01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
and the answer was okay well you have to
 
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
be appointed by the governor that is
 
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
like to to most people is going to be a
 
01:19:27.649 --> 01:19:27.659 align:start position:0%
huge hurdle
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
if I could comment on that
 
01:19:30.239 --> 01:19:31.149 align:start position:0%
if I could comment on that
um

01:19:31.149 --> 01:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know I
 
01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
I think in general
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
these kind of things the governor would
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
welcome I mean if there's some other
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
organization that can they don't have to
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
appoint but they can they can make
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations anybody can make
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
recommendations and I I think basically
 
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
my experience with the executive Council
 
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
does when a vets these things just to
 
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
see if there's some problem with the
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
person where they be I mean they're not
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
it's not their job to go out and find
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
people and the governor has somebody at
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
least one person I think
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
in his office who tries to find people
 
01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
for these things and I'm sure they would
 
01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:08.630 align:start position:0%
for these things and I'm sure they would
welcome

01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
help so I don't having having this check
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
where the governor and Council approves
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem with that but
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have to do the full job of
 
01:20:20.689 --> 01:20:20.699 align:start position:0%
finding people I don't think sorry do
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
you know that the director of
 
01:20:23.810 --> 01:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
appointments is here and I'm happy to
 
01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
offer insight into what the current
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
process looks like if you would like
 
01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.350 align:start position:0%
process looks like if you would like
um

01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
we have an online application somebody
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
submits their interest they apply online
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
they submit their resume and they need
 
01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
two letters of reference and then we
 
01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
make sure if it's a professional person
 
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
that they have a valid license and they
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
fit the description of whatever the
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements are and then we
 
01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
send it over my understanding is there
 
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
are not a bunch of people that are just
 
01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
waiting to be appointed
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
um from a public member seat the other
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
thing that you may want to consider is
 
01:21:05.209 --> 01:21:05.219 align:start position:0%
that there are some statutes not the
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
that allow organizations to appoint or
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
nominate people that can actually get
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
problematic from my perspective because
 
01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
the purpose is to protect the public and
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
oftentimes you have associations and
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
their job is to promote the profession
 
01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:23.060 align:start position:0%
which is very different
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
and so you don't necessarily want people
 
01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
being seated who wear to hats to promote
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
the profession and to protect the public
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
because it's very difficult to separate
 
01:21:38.689 --> 01:21:38.699 align:start position:0%
the two so that just some things to
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
consider I can understand that but it
 
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
seems to me that there's an easier way
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
of doing this and I think that
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
no offense to applying online but that's
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
very impersonal when it comes to
 
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
something like this okay you know you
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
you want somebody who is
 
01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:58.910 align:start position:0%
you want somebody who is
uh

01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
I I just you know I just think that this
 
01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
is something if we're having if we're
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
having a difficulty in filling the
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
position there's some there's a reason
 
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to know what that reason is
 
01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.709 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to know what that reason is
and

01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:12.050 --> 01:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
I think that's an important that's an
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
important thing well one again one
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
comment I make is I'd suggest if I'll
 
01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
get to you I'm on my side
 
01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:20.810 align:start position:0%
get to you I'm on my side
um

01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
you know if there's a number of other
 
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
states are doing this with more success
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
I think before we try and design
 
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.649 align:start position:0%
I think before we try and design
something

01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
and change the process if you could look
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
into or have somebody look into how that
 
01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
works elsewhere how they find people
 
01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:38.219 align:start position:0%
and and vet them and whether there's
 
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
lessons we could take from that that
 
01:22:41.689 --> 01:22:41.699 align:start position:0%
might help us
 
01:22:45.729 --> 01:22:45.739 align:start position:0%
um yeah and uh representative Schmidt
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I don't think
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
that the problem is that it's a
 
01:22:57.169 --> 01:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
complicated process I think that the at
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
least partially the problem is that
 
01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
people just don't want to serve in these
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
positions in many cases and in other
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
cases as representative Gould was
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
alluding to earlier they have no idea
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
that there's such an option even out
 
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
there so duh there's all kinds of things
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
where people say really the world is
 
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
round but it looks so flat I mean Texas
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
the roads go on and on bro it's so
 
01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
flattered are you sure the world is
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
around yep we're sure okay so the bottom
 
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
line is there's a lot of ignorance out
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
there it's not that it's hard to get
 
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
something through the process if you've
 
01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:38.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
I'm against tinkering with the process
 
01:23:44.689 --> 01:23:44.699 align:start position:0%
until we look at and your suggestion I
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
think is a very good one to look at
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
other states but we we have
 
01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
I think both most of the public members
 
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
come from the boards themselves that
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
suggest practitioners
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh you know look to friends relatives
 
01:24:07.850 --> 01:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
debtors whatever uh they suggest their
 
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
own public members in many cases all
 
01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
right yeah if I could comment on that I
 
01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
mean that's actually not what we want we
 
01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
want people that are
 
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
members of the public and not as closely
 
01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
associated I think with
 
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
with people in the process even if they
 
01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
technically meet the statutory
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
requirements and I mean I I had no idea
 
01:24:30.169 --> 01:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
there were public members in these
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
boards until I got involved in the State
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
Rep business and on Edna and I I know
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
plenty of people
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
I mean I've talked to a lot of people in
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
town I know people in town who retired
 
01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
with a range of interests and expertise
 
01:24:43.729 --> 01:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
there are some of them who would be good
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
and willing to serve if they had a clue
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
that any of this was out there so I'm
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
curious how other states manage to
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
publicize this stuff
 
01:24:57.649 --> 01:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
um and you know New Hampshire is
 
01:24:59.090 --> 01:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
different in some ways but maybe we can
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
learn something we used to have
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
something in this country called Civics
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
that were taught in school but we
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
stopped teaching it so people don't know
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
oh really
 
01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
we have an executive branch or we have a
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary representative moffett's had
 
01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
some bills to try to attempt to fix that
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
how successful they'll be I don't know
 
01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
we'll have to see and um
 
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
we're happy to work to to look into
 
01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
research what other states are doing and
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
to do what we can to further promote the
 
01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
public member
 
01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:31.310 align:start position:0%
public member
um

01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.390 align:start position:0%
um
that

01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
role I think
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
um obviously we're challenged by
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
resources as well I mean we could we
 
01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:41.219 align:start position:0%
could run ad campaigns that's not
 
01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
something that we presently have the
 
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
capability of doing but there are a
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
whole host of things that we could do if
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
we if if that were
 
01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:50.810 align:start position:0%
we if if that were
um

01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm asked one of the reasons I'm
 
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
reacting to this because I'm thinking is
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
that you're within your responsibility
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
is that not the boy's responsibility to
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
fill the board as opposed to you I don't
 
01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
think it's either I don't think it's
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
either responsibility to be honest with
 
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
you I think that that's something we
 
01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
could do because we are providing
 
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
administrative support and we need a
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
fully functioning board in order to
 
01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
um to to meet our objectives
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
you know the governor has to nominate
 
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
but it's not even the Governor's job to
 
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
go and search for candidates I think
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I think the way the statute is
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
structures it presumes that there are
 
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
people interested and are just aware of
 
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
this and it doesn't necessarily require
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
any one body to nobody's responsibility
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't happen
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
well you know we do take an active role
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
within our resources I think that the
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
um you know we have a lot of other
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
things going on and we don't have the
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
resources to meet members of the public
 
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
I think if you really want to advertise
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
this year would be doing advertising
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
campaigns with WMUR you'd have PR
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
campaigns you'd be re-reaching all sorts
 
01:26:58.970 --> 01:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
of ads I mean I mean where else are you
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
going to reach the members of the public
 
01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not through the Avenues
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
the traditional avenues that we have
 
01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
which is through our licensees our 242
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
000 licenses and I agree with you
 
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative lake is that we don't
 
01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
want to just have friends and friends
 
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
and friends so how do you reach the
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
um actually represent Bailey had a
 
01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
question for us and then representative
 
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
well I hope mine are kind of simple I'm
 
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
relatively new to this I've had some
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
time but are these people paid yeah they
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
receive a per diem but it's it's minimal
 
01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:35.209 align:start position:0%
receive a per diem but it's it's minimal
yeah

01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:35.219 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
yeah what's the function I mean it's a
 
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
board of experts I keep hearing yes and
 
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
then suddenly we're gonna have a
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
non-expert yes
 
01:27:43.739 --> 01:27:44.450 align:start position:0%
non-expert yes
um

01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
they're there to watch the Watchers or
 
01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
what are they there for no so they're
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
they're there to represent the Public's
 
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
interest and I'll give you an example
 
01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:52.910 align:start position:0%
interest and I'll give you an example
um

01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know if they're um
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
we have had situations where a board has
 
01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
reviewed a complaint and they're
 
01:28:07.129 --> 01:28:07.139 align:start position:0%
reviewing it from the expertise from the
 
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
from their perspective as an expert
 
01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
um but it's very important to have the
 
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
perspective of the public member when
 
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
they're reviewing the complaint if their
 
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
goal is to protect the public because
 
01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:20.330 align:start position:0%
goal is to protect the public because
maybe

01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
it's not misconduct whatever is alleged
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
in the complaint but maybe it should be
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
because the Public's perception and
 
01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
expectation is that that be considered
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
not standard of care for example and so
 
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important that the
 
01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
public member be able to engage with the
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
members of the regulator the other
 
01:28:43.129 --> 01:28:43.139 align:start position:0%
members of the regulatory body to make
 
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up are you seeking people that
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
have some expertise in these or at least
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
some interest in these medical fields or
 
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
well that's we just went out on the
 
01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
street and picked up 10 people or
 
01:28:59.689 --> 01:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
something they wouldn't know anything
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
about psychology I assume I mean
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
honestly the the best people who are the
 
01:29:05.930 --> 01:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
people who don't know anything about
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
what it is that you're intended to do
 
01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
because they represent the public and
 
01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
most members of the public don't know
 
01:29:12.649 --> 01:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
anything about the practice of
 
01:29:12.659 --> 01:29:13.790 align:start position:0%
anything about the practice of
psychology

01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
psychology
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
but they maybe could say hey wait a
 
01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
minute that doesn't sound right yeah
 
01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
correct that's what we're about to do
 
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gold thank you
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
I love what you were saying in terms of
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
the advertising piece and I'll just give
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
this one short example I was in DC for a
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
conference and Maryland Public Radio did
 
01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
these announcements that I was like why
 
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:41.219 align:start position:0%
does New Hampshire not do this like
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
other states do public information
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
campaigns and this was one was about
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
zipping in traffic like when you're
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
entering a highway to zip every other
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
car like what a novel freaking idea so
 
01:29:57.490 --> 01:29:57.500 align:start position:0%
I've taught everybody I know how to zip
 
01:29:59.689 --> 01:29:59.699 align:start position:0%
since I heard that on a public
 
01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
announcement on the radio and so I think
 
01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
that if we can figure out who does those
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
in other states because it shouldn't be
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
your responsibility and the worst thing
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
is to have the board make the decisions
 
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
about who the public members are not
 
01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:15.719 align:start position:0%
because I mean a good functioning board
 
01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
will recruit good people but when you
 
01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
get a rogue board then you're you're
 
01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
locking out any any good people so I
 
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
really like that where you're going with
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
that and I think maybe we can help with
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
finding out who could who in New
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Government Can can do those
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
kind of PR campaigns for things like
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
this yeah we just created a position of
 
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
a public information officer designed to
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
facilitate better Communications and so
 
01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
we're starting to build out a better
 
01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
communication strategy which I think
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
this will necessarily be part of that
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
um you know I think it would be helpful
 
01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
you know if the legislature feels that
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
this is an important objective for us to
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
prioritize we can certainly do that
 
01:30:59.570 --> 01:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
obviously there are resources uh funding
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
Appropriations associated with that you
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
know if that's the direction we need to
 
01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
go right now we've just been working
 
01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:06.900 align:start position:0%
within our existing resources and our
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and it's not really
 
01:31:11.450 --> 01:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
working so and
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
I mean New Hampshire does do some of
 
01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
that I think Department of Safety
 
01:31:17.870 --> 01:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
Department transportation does some
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
level of PR campaigns plus they've got
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
their electronic signs out all over the
 
01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.149 align:start position:0%
their electronic signs out all over the
place

01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think the state does a
 
01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
lot of that I have a
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
couple of questions so you mentioned the
 
01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:35.300 align:start position:0%
three boards that hp2 proposed merging
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
have there been problems with them not
 
01:31:39.890 --> 01:31:39.900 align:start position:0%
being able to do their job due to lack
 
01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
of quorum to if so to what extent has
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
the lack of public members been
 
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
contributing to that you know what how's
 
01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
it going yeah they do not have Quorum
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
issues none of none of these boards have
 
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
Quorum issues I think that and again I
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the governor but I think
 
01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
the purpose was to help promote
 
01:31:59.209 --> 01:31:59.219 align:start position:0%
collaboration as opposed to silos and
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
one of the bills that you heard this
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
year was to expand the scope of practice
 
01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
of an M ladak some concerns that we
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
heard and oplc didn't take a position
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
but some concerns that we heard from the
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
board of mental health practice is that
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
they would have the same scope of
 
01:32:16.490 --> 01:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
practice but not be regulated by the
 
01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
board of mental health practice and so I
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
think that one of the justifications
 
01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
toward merging these boards was
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
certainly not punitive but it was to
 
01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:30.620 align:start position:0%
Foster collaboration between disciplines
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
that may have
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
similar overlapping scopes
 
01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
okay so I mean I have a question I was
 
01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
just gonna say I mean maybe in the
 
01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
future we could look at some level I
 
01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
mean maybe merging the laidac and mental
 
01:32:49.129 --> 01:32:49.139 align:start position:0%
health practice boards might make sense
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know somebody disagrees
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
but uh representative groda I want to go
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
back a little bit to that appointment
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
thing and there is is there someone from
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
the governor's office that can answer
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
the product it can go through the
 
01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
process because that would be I think I
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
would be interested to knowing that if
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's somebody who's who can do that
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
she's here you can do that is it okay
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
with you if we sure yeah come on up
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.169 --> 01:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
for the record Deanna Juris and the
 
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
governor's director of appointments
 
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
um so you're looking at the the one
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
person who puts everybody on these
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
boards uh through the governor and
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
Council process
 
01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.810 align:start position:0%
Council process
um

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
so I'll just kind of talk you through a
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
little bit about what that looks like
 
01:33:41.209 --> 01:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
um the function I won't speak for the
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
council I don't represent them obviously
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
I work for the governor but I am the
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
governor's liaison between his office
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
and the executive Council
 
01:33:50.450 --> 01:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
um so I spend a fair bit of time with
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
them I've learned the process better
 
01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
than I ever thought I would
 
01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:55.070 align:start position:0%
than I ever thought I would
um

01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
I would say being nominated and
 
01:33:59.629 --> 01:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
confirmed through the council is the
 
01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
easiest part of that business meeting if
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
you've ever attended a governor and
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
council meeting with those contracts and
 
01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
um you are more intimately familiar than
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
Manny just how much
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
State resources how many state resources
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
go into just preparing a contract to get
 
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
on that agenda it is extensive it is a
 
01:34:23.050 --> 01:34:23.060 align:start position:0%
weeks and months long process often
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
multiple departments are involved in not
 
01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
just the not just the office that that
 
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
brings the contract I would say it's
 
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
much easier to be nominated and
 
01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:34.860 align:start position:0%
confirmed on a on the governor's list of
 
01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
nominations than to have a contract to
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
prove it to the state level I don't
 
01:34:41.770 --> 01:34:41.780 align:start position:0%
director Courtney would you agree
 
01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:43.669 align:start position:0%
director Courtney would you agree
yes

01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
um so all of that to say
 
01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:47.450 align:start position:0%
um so all of that to say
um

01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:49.129 --> 01:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
we all know New Hampshire is a unique
 
01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
place right the executive council is a
 
01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
unique executive body and the purpose of
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
it is to slow down the process to have
 
01:34:58.490 --> 01:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
very very public accountability on state
 
01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
spending and on these appointments so a
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
number of these almost all of the
 
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
licensing boards I would say there are
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
very few exceptions are just out of the
 
01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
governor's office but the large majority
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
of these licensing boards go through the
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
council because of the public
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
accountability if the governor is the
 
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
sole appointing authority the
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation comes into our office and
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
the letter comes out and they're on
 
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
right and with the council process much
 
01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
like in other states with the Senate
 
01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:26.689 align:start position:0%
like in other states with the Senate
confirmation

01:35:26.689 --> 01:35:26.699 align:start position:0%
confirmation
 
01:35:26.699 --> 01:35:27.290 align:start position:0%
confirmation
um

01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
the the letter comes into our office the
 
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
governor still is the sole nominating
 
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
Authority largely
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
um for licensing boards for sure
 
01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
um but then it goes to the council their
 
01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
resume is made public their contact
 
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
information is made public they're
 
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
expected to reach out to all five
 
01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:44.810 align:start position:0%
expected to reach out to all five
members

01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:35:47.689 --> 01:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
um so that we're not just it's not just
 
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
friends of you know whoever is in the
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
corner office right so that that
 
01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
promotes that process I think that's the
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
purpose of it is it cumbersome yes it
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely is and and I think that's by
 
01:36:00.239 --> 01:36:01.310 align:start position:0%
absolutely is and and I think that's by
Design

01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
Design
 
01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the process really though
 
01:36:05.810 --> 01:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
the online application it seems
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
impersonal but it really streamed lined
 
01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
and I think it improved the experience
 
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
for people who are applying
 
01:36:13.610 --> 01:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
um what happened was sometimes we would
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
get a letter of interest but without a
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
resume and no letters of recommendation
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
or you know we would get three of the
 
01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
four pieces and administratively between
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
my office and staff between oplesc staff
 
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
trying to support and then the licensee
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
you could be emailing back and forth for
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
weeks and weeks just to get a complete
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
application together and then as we know
 
01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
right the council only meets so often so
 
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
those the appointments are only reviewed
 
01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
so regularly so we actually have
 
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
streamlined it and very much shortened
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
the process because you once you hit
 
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
submit right you can't hit submit until
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
everything's in and so once you've
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
applied you've done it there's there's
 
01:36:53.950 --> 01:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
potentially Outreach between our office
 
01:36:56.090 --> 01:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have multiple candidates
 
01:36:57.770 --> 01:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
applying for a seat I would say
 
01:36:59.870 --> 01:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that is
 
01:37:02.689 --> 01:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
um less common I don't have people
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
beating down the door of my email inbox
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
to serve on these boards um
 
01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
so we we process every application
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
individually and they all I mean they're
 
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
all read by by members of staff and
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
reviewed there so I mean I'd be happy to
 
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
answer any other questions about that
 
01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:21.830 align:start position:0%
answer any other questions about that
process

01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
um actually I'll make one comment I've
 
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
gone through this because
 
01:37:28.729 --> 01:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
um I'm a Justice of the Peace which goes
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
basically through the same process and
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
I forget if I did it online or there was
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
a form I said I think it was a form and
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
I sent it in with
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know two other JPS who
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
you know couldn't recommend it or
 
01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
whatever me and the process it just
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
cranked through and it it happened and
 
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
you know that that wasn't the issue it
 
01:37:51.649 --> 01:37:51.659 align:start position:0%
sounds like the issue is finding public
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
members and you know what if anything do
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
you do to try and find public members
 
01:37:59.930 --> 01:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
for the boards we do rely heavily on on
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from a number of different
 
01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.750 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from a number of different
areas

01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
um even I was just thinking through
 
01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:05.629 align:start position:0%
um even I was just thinking through
um

01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
a full disclosure I served as a state
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative in in 2019 and 2020 and I
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
would say there's no one that knows your
 
01:38:14.450 --> 01:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
community and better than than all of
 
01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
you right there's 400 representatives in
 
01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:18.780 align:start position:0%
these communities and it is a great
 
01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
resource of of doing that Civics
 
01:38:22.490 --> 01:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
education that was one of my favorite
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
things was just explaining here here's
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
what's happening in state government
 
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
people don't even know about some of
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
these processes
 
01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
um and it was really I had some amazing
 
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
conversations just out and about with my
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
community talking to voters talking to
 
01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
people about what was going on and so I
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about that would be a
 
01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:42.179 align:start position:0%
great resource for me for people that
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
you have interested I do have state reps
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
that reach out this is a constituent
 
01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
who's interested in this you know
 
01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
whether they're a licensee or a public
 
01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
member and I think that would be a great
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
resource that also would be free right
 
01:38:56.209 --> 01:38:56.219 align:start position:0%
I'm not paying for advertising
 
01:38:57.709 --> 01:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
um I don't have to put signs out for
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
that right but um you're interacting
 
01:39:01.729 --> 01:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
with people day to day I would say the
 
01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
same thing is true for those of us in
 
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
our office as you know we're interacting
 
01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
with lots of people
 
01:39:09.169 --> 01:39:09.179 align:start position:0%
we have lobbyists who are very well
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
connected as well that support us in
 
01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
that way but as you know New Hampshire
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
is a very frugal State the budget is
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
lean that is no exception in the
 
01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
governor's office so there's no padded
 
01:39:21.290 --> 01:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
advertising budget whatsoever so it is
 
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
largely word of mouth and Outreach in
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
that regard so director Courtney is
 
01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.050 align:start position:0%
that regard so director Courtney is
there

01:39:27.050 --> 01:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
director Courtney is there
 
01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:30.649 align:start position:0%
director Courtney is there
um

01:39:30.649 --> 01:39:30.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:33.659 align:start position:0%
maybe one convenient place on the
 
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
website where people can see what are
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunities especially for public
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
members on boards yes certainly so if
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
you go to our home page and I'd be happy
 
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
to send this to you I'd be happy to send
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
it to the entire general court if they
 
01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
would not be confused as to why I'm
 
01:39:47.209 --> 01:39:47.219 align:start position:0%
sending that
 
01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
um but if you go to our home page drop
 
01:39:51.169 --> 01:39:51.179 align:start position:0%
down how to be interested in becoming a
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
board member you click on it and it'll
 
01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
explain the process it all it also
 
01:39:58.729 --> 01:39:58.739 align:start position:0%
explains the commitment because we want
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
people to understand we want people to
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
be active and engaged on these boards
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
because as as you know that's another
 
01:40:07.370 --> 01:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
issue on certain boards so it explains
 
01:40:09.649 --> 01:40:09.659 align:start position:0%
the commitment and what's involved and
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
it just provides the online application
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
right there and we get it automatically
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
through our emails multiple people we've
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
edit in terms of making sure it's
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
complete and then we send it over to the
 
01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
governor's office so I have a request if
 
01:40:24.050 --> 01:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
you write up something brief that
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
describes what public members are and
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
what they do and then a link after that
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
I would be glad to sponsor that as a
 
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
member notice in the house calendar
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
wonderful I'd be happy to to do that
 
01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and as far as I you know I
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recommend mailing it to the
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
whole house without at least talking
 
01:40:42.530 --> 01:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
with the speaker but
 
01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:44.030 align:start position:0%
with the speaker but
valid

01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
valid
 
01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:46.139 align:start position:0%
if I might just add really quickly that
 
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
licensing boards are one very small part
 
01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
of the council confirms thousands and
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
thousands uh over ten thousand roles and
 
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
board members and that that's just that
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
go through the council
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
um not including things that just come
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office or as you
 
01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:03.179 align:start position:0%
know other legislative committees so
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of pointees in this
 
01:41:07.729 --> 01:41:07.739 align:start position:0%
state and and really there's 1.4 million
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
people so at some point you know we get
 
01:41:11.450 --> 01:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
to our percentage of volunteerism
 
01:41:13.129 --> 01:41:13.139 align:start position:0%
although lower than it used to be is
 
01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
still pretty high just by the nature of
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
these boards but sometimes we have
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
people serving on three four even more
 
01:41:18.719 --> 01:41:20.030 align:start position:0%
people serving on three four even more
boards

01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
boards
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
um in that way which is obviously very
 
01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:24.110 align:start position:0%
um in that way which is obviously very
kind

01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
kind
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
um but it does get challenging but just
 
01:41:28.010 --> 01:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
just to keep that in mind I would say as
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
as you're considering changes to the
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
process or or not that licensing boards
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
is it's not a small piece of this
 
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:37.139 align:start position:0%
committee but it is a small piece of the
 
01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
councils even just their appointing
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
authority role so I would just be
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
mindful of that they're doing this for
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
across the state government I understand
 
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
I mean for the notice thing I was
 
01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
thinking public members to do what you
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
had suggested was to have the Reps do
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
Outreach to let people in the district
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
know and maybe recommend people who
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
would they think would be good and not
 
01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
just licensing boards there are a lot of
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
volunteer boards I think we could we
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
could potentially make it even more
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
broad than that
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
um yeah there's one Consolidated place
 
01:42:04.609 --> 01:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
people could go look at all that and
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
maybe you know making this too
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
complicated will cause problems so I
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to say you know make this
 
01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
big and complicated I will tend not to
 
01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:17.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schmidt
 
01:42:23.209 --> 01:42:23.219 align:start position:0%
having served on this committee for for
 
01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
17 years now I can tell you the subject
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
has come up on many occasions and also
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
being on the uh joint committee on
 
01:42:34.689 --> 01:42:34.699 align:start position:0%
uh legislative
 
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
administrative rules uh
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
even getting people to come to conquer
 
01:42:42.649 --> 01:42:42.659 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
if we find somebody who's a volunteer
 
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
who's interested in serving we try to
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
get him to run for State Rep because
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
there ain't enough people running for
 
01:42:56.090 --> 01:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
State Rep in many cases so it and I've
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
heard it constantly people talk about
 
01:43:02.209 --> 01:43:02.219 align:start position:0%
um we're we can't get enough people to
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
serve in the local communities on the
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
Town Council or city council or you name
 
01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
it the public is not sufficiently
 
01:43:13.209 --> 01:43:13.219 align:start position:0%
involved because this is heavily
 
01:43:16.129 --> 01:43:16.139 align:start position:0%
volunteerism in this state so there's a
 
01:43:17.930 --> 01:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
lot of opportunities and they're not a
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
lot of people that's just a reality yeah
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
so far there's in my district there have
 
01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
been at least three constituents who
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
called me about an issue and uh let's
 
01:43:29.689 --> 01:43:29.699 align:start position:0%
doomed them I've talked them into
 
01:43:31.629 --> 01:43:31.639 align:start position:0%
running and they've gotten elected so
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's dangerous calling me
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative Gould
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you guys
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and taking my
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
um I think that what you just talked
 
01:43:49.850 --> 01:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
about in terms of the sheer volume and
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
and The Limited population I
 
01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.350 align:start position:0%
and The Limited population I
um

01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
I was going to say I think New Hampshire
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
people you know New Hampshire citizens
 
01:43:59.870 --> 01:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
really love to volunteer but then I've
 
01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
learned since I've come into this role
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire isn't what I always
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
knew it to be and we have a lot of
 
01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:08.219 align:start position:0%
newcomers so I can't speak for for that
 
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
population but
 
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
um and in our district I know that a lot
 
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:13.860 align:start position:0%
of people want to volunteer but it makes
 
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
all the more sense in terms of merging
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
boards if we can limit the number and
 
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
and get each board functioning really
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
really well and in regard to the topic
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
we have in front of us the Mental Health
 
01:44:26.890 --> 01:44:26.900 align:start position:0%
crisis that we have in New Hampshire
 
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
they I love what director Courtney
 
01:44:32.689 --> 01:44:32.699 align:start position:0%
mentioned in terms of getting out of the
 
01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
silos and getting some collaboration
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
going because if we can't get laidac and
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
clinical social workers and
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
psychologists to be willing to sit at
 
01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
the same table and address these
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
problems and help solve them then the
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
the population the police department in
 
01:44:52.729 --> 01:44:52.739 align:start position:0%
my community that that 80 percent of
 
01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
their calls are for mental health and
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence what hope do they have
 
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
if you all can't sit together and come
 
01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
up with Solutions in in a collaborative
 
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
manner that are going to solve things so
 
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
I I really support merging of the board
 
01:45:10.729 --> 01:45:10.739 align:start position:0%
and I haven't seen or heard anything
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
that tells me why that would be really
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
horrible other than power and control
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
and I think that that is the worst okay
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a comment on that
 
01:45:24.169 --> 01:45:24.179 align:start position:0%
because the mental health board's
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility is although they're
 
01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
involved with the
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
process of mental health in New
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they're responsible for it
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
the boards themselves serve a different
 
01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:35.390 align:start position:0%
the boards themselves serve a different
function

01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
and I think it's very important that we
 
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
do that and merging the boards I think
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
is detrimental to solving the problem
 
01:45:43.790 --> 01:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
mental health and so I don't think that
 
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
we should make any decisions today based
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
on that there's a discussion this is a
 
01:45:50.209 --> 01:45:50.219 align:start position:0%
discussion and I really think that we
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
need to understand the issue of mental
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
health and that is quite different than
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
how oplc and the boards work together
 
01:46:00.649 --> 01:46:00.659 align:start position:0%
that is a completely different thing and
 
01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
I think those need to be separated
 
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
because they are distinctive
 
01:46:08.090 --> 01:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
um they they are distinctive in in their
 
01:46:09.169 --> 01:46:09.179 align:start position:0%
own right
 
01:46:12.649 --> 01:46:12.659 align:start position:0%
right I I mean no um
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
one thing is I know there are people
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
here want to speak and we're not going
 
01:46:18.109 --> 01:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
to do that but that doesn't mean you
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
can't contact the committee or contact
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
people in the committee and provide uh
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
whatever information you want we're not
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
I mean this is to be just you know for
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
us to get information
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
um there's no bill before us
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
so there's there's not any solid
 
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
decision that we intend to make today
 
01:46:38.689 --> 01:46:38.699 align:start position:0%
um it's to get some ideas and you know
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
anybody uh from the public and provide
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
email in input as well
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
or arrange to talk with somebody
 
01:46:52.609 --> 01:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
separately also follow up Mr chair yep
 
01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
follow up I'd like to thank
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
my esteemed colleague from from the
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
Seacoast for that uh reminder that we're
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
just here to gather information and I
 
01:47:05.209 --> 01:47:05.219 align:start position:0%
also wanted to point out we did get a
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
letter from the board of psychologists
 
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
and email that talked about that their
 
01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
um Community three community members
 
01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
were fully staffed so maybe that's
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
something new
 
01:47:18.290 --> 01:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
but at any rate I was happy to get that
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
information and I think the gathering
 
01:47:21.649 --> 01:47:21.659 align:start position:0%
information is an important role and
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
anything else for anybody on the
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee otherwise all right I'm going
 
01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
to close this uh discussion but it's not
 
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
the end of the discussion I mean
 
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
there'll be ongoing stuff and people can
 
01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
provide input and uh
 
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
see where we go
 
01:47:40.980 --> 02:00:41.570 align:start position:0%
see where we go
and

02:00:41.570 --> 02:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:41.580 --> 03:01:08.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:01:08.210 --> 03:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:10.370 --> 03:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
hi everybody it's one o'clock and we're
 
03:01:11.690 --> 03:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
going to start
 
03:01:14.929 --> 03:01:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:17.630 --> 03:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
is not this is a subcommittee workshop
 
03:01:20.090 --> 03:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
and what we're working on is what was in
 
03:01:21.710 --> 03:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
house built two
 
03:01:24.070 --> 03:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:01:26.870 --> 03:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
involving disciplinary actions so you
 
03:01:28.969 --> 03:01:28.979 align:start position:0%
might remember that in-house Bill 2 and
 
03:01:32.150 --> 03:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 655 there were Clauses that
 
03:01:34.250 --> 03:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
removed the disciplinary actions from
 
03:01:35.750 --> 03:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
the boards
 
03:01:39.910 --> 03:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
and that seem to be a sticking point
 
03:01:42.650 --> 03:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
with much of the testimony that we had
 
03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
when we had a hearing for house bill
 
03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
655. so um one of the things that we
 
03:01:51.950 --> 03:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
want to talk about today was that what
 
03:01:53.870 --> 03:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do is discuss that among the
 
03:01:56.150 --> 03:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
committee first and then if there's
 
03:01:59.630 --> 03:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
anybody that has any comments to make
 
03:02:01.670 --> 03:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
um we can do that is there anybody here
 
03:02:04.130 --> 03:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
who is not supposed to be here or
 
03:02:06.950 --> 03:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
thinking they're in the wrong place or
 
03:02:09.530 --> 03:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
nope okay good
 
03:02:09.540 --> 03:02:11.030 align:start position:0%
nope okay good
because

03:02:11.030 --> 03:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:02:13.490 --> 03:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
um this was not in the in the electronic
 
03:02:13.500 --> 03:02:14.630 align:start position:0%
um this was not in the in the electronic
calendar

03:02:14.630 --> 03:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
03:02:17.210 --> 03:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
and we found out that there's
 
03:02:20.450 --> 03:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
some sort of glitch in the calendar that
 
03:02:22.670 --> 03:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
unless you reference a bill it won't
 
03:02:24.530 --> 03:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
appear in the calendar that's being
 
03:02:27.290 --> 03:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
addressed by the IT department so that's
 
03:02:29.210 --> 03:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
why this was this this
 
03:02:33.769 --> 03:02:33.779 align:start position:0%
um meeting was originally noted a notice
 
03:02:38.030 --> 03:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 655 and because 655 was a
 
03:02:40.730 --> 03:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
was passed and sent to the Senate we can
 
03:02:43.550 --> 03:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
no longer use that number
 
03:02:45.170 --> 03:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
those are the things you probably didn't
 
03:02:45.180 --> 03:02:46.010 align:start position:0%
those are the things you probably didn't
know

03:02:46.010 --> 03:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:02:49.550 --> 03:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
about noticing so um
 
03:02:51.950 --> 03:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
one of the I think concerns the boards
 
03:02:53.450 --> 03:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
had and I'm talking to the committee I
 
03:02:54.469 --> 03:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
think one of the concerns that the
 
03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
boards had when we when this Clause was
 
03:03:00.830 --> 03:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
put in the in the House Bill had to deal
 
03:03:02.690 --> 03:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
with the fact that boards were concerned
 
03:03:05.150 --> 03:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
about what their roles would be in
 
03:03:07.510 --> 03:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
regarding disciplinary actions
 
03:03:11.090 --> 03:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
if they're if that was repealed from
 
03:03:11.100 --> 03:03:12.710 align:start position:0%
if they're if that was repealed from
their

03:03:12.710 --> 03:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:03:12.720 --> 03:03:14.690 align:start position:0%
their
um statute

03:03:14.690 --> 03:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
um statute
 
03:03:20.510 --> 03:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that the intent of the
 
03:03:20.520 --> 03:03:21.710 align:start position:0%
and I think that the intent of the
um

03:03:21.710 --> 03:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
the bill and those statements was to
 
03:03:27.010 --> 03:03:27.020 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
03:03:29.030 --> 03:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
investigations and investigation
 
03:03:32.210 --> 03:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
protocol was was under the jurisdiction
 
03:03:35.809 --> 03:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
of the administration the oplc portion
 
03:03:38.929 --> 03:03:38.939 align:start position:0%
but adjudication would still stay as a
 
03:03:41.090 --> 03:03:41.100 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the board
 
03:03:43.790 --> 03:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
but because that statement was removed
 
03:03:46.130 --> 03:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
from statute I think it gave the
 
03:03:47.690 --> 03:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
impression to the boards that they
 
03:03:52.070 --> 03:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:55.790 --> 03:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
so I think what we could do is
 
03:03:59.150 --> 03:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that those those delineations
 
03:04:02.510 --> 03:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
are defined in statute and that the
 
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
board does have
 
03:04:04.920 --> 03:04:06.230 align:start position:0%
board does have
standing

03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
standing
 
03:04:09.110 --> 03:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
when determining adjudication for
 
03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:10.490 align:start position:0%
when determining adjudication for
complaints

03:04:10.490 --> 03:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
03:04:13.190 --> 03:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to open that up to the
 
03:04:20.809 --> 03:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:22.610 --> 03:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
and if you don't want to talk about it
 
03:04:24.950 --> 03:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
well go ahead the currents the current
 
03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
situation is that the boards do right
 
03:04:31.429 --> 03:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
and has there been a problem with that
 
03:04:34.429 --> 03:04:34.439 align:start position:0%
the current situation is that the boards
 
03:04:34.439 --> 03:04:35.090 align:start position:0%
the current situation is that the boards
um

03:04:35.090 --> 03:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:35.100 --> 03:04:36.530 align:start position:0%
um
would

03:04:36.530 --> 03:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:04:38.750 --> 03:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
you mean disciplinary actions yeah in
 
03:04:40.210 --> 03:04:40.220 align:start position:0%
other words
 
03:04:45.230 --> 03:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
what problem was this bill trying to fix
 
03:04:47.570 --> 03:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
it we're supposed to so you really can't
 
03:04:51.050 --> 03:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
have the same person doing the ins in
 
03:04:54.950 --> 03:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
the you can't have the investigation
 
03:04:57.710 --> 03:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
being done by the same body that's going
 
03:04:59.630 --> 03:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
to do the adjudication right because you
 
03:05:03.769 --> 03:05:03.779 align:start position:0%
have so that was so that that part of
 
03:05:07.730 --> 03:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
the statute is what's being discussed so
 
03:05:10.370 --> 03:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
that wasn't clearly defined
 
03:05:13.610 --> 03:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
and that's what and the definition was
 
03:05:17.150 --> 03:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
to remove that that part of the statute
 
03:05:19.210 --> 03:05:19.220 align:start position:0%
from the board
 
03:05:22.250 --> 03:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
however I'm not sure that in taking that
 
03:05:25.190 --> 03:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
out it didn't cause an issue with
 
03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of the role that the board
 
03:05:30.110 --> 03:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
has an adjudication well then let's uh
 
03:05:36.410 --> 03:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:39.410 --> 03:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
I have had a couple people not on the
 
03:05:41.210 --> 03:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
committee expressed to me that they're
 
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
afraid of it a little bit because they
 
03:05:45.290 --> 03:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
think of it as a way station that okay
 
03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
we remove
 
03:05:49.610 --> 03:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
the full thing and split it and then at
 
03:05:51.530 --> 03:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
some point in the future we'll just
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
remove it entirely
 
03:05:56.809 --> 03:05:56.819 align:start position:0%
the adjudication aspect as well as the
 
03:05:58.490 --> 03:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
now removing the investigation now
 
03:06:00.110 --> 03:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
they're just adjudication at some point
 
03:06:02.030 --> 03:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
we'll just remove the adjudication just
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
as easily
 
03:06:06.410 --> 03:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
it's a fear you know but
 
03:06:08.210 --> 03:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
maybe if we had something in there
 
03:06:08.220 --> 03:06:10.070 align:start position:0%
maybe if we had something in there
specifying

03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
specifying
 
03:06:12.230 --> 03:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
what you were alluding to if it was
 
03:06:14.269 --> 03:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
specifically in there that this is your
 
03:06:14.279 --> 03:06:15.349 align:start position:0%
specifically in there that this is your
role

03:06:15.349 --> 03:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
role
 
03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
then maybe that fear would be alleviated
 
03:06:21.889 --> 03:06:21.899 align:start position:0%
to some extent just one comment on that
 
03:06:23.630 --> 03:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
I mean first of all you could do
 
03:06:25.429 --> 03:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
something like that but I mean as I
 
03:06:27.230 --> 03:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
understand that's not the intent and
 
03:06:29.210 --> 03:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
realistically we can't bind to Future
 
03:06:31.250 --> 03:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
legislature so I mean in the future
 
03:06:33.410 --> 03:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
whatever could be done we can't
 
03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee it won't but I think all we
 
03:06:36.889 --> 03:06:36.899 align:start position:0%
can say is that's not what we're looking
 
03:06:39.710 --> 03:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
to do at this point and there's reasons
 
03:06:46.309 --> 03:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:48.170 --> 03:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
is there somebody from an open did you
 
03:06:51.349 --> 03:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:55.010 --> 03:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
just a response to the previous comment
 
03:06:58.730 --> 03:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
no we can't bind future legislatures but
 
03:07:01.010 --> 03:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
we can make the laws for the state to
 
03:07:01.020 --> 03:07:03.830 align:start position:0%
we can make the laws for the state to
abide

03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:06.230 --> 03:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
so you see someone from oplc that can
 
03:07:08.210 --> 03:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
help get that can speak to this because
 
03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:25.849 --> 03:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Douglas holster how
 
03:07:28.429 --> 03:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
general counsel for oplc
 
03:07:30.469 --> 03:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
and Jessica calipolitis I'm the
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:40.490 --> 03:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
is there a specific question would you
 
03:07:43.610 --> 03:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
like me to just can you go over the
 
03:07:47.030 --> 03:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
current practice of how this whole
 
03:07:49.550 --> 03:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
process from you know the the complaint
 
03:07:53.150 --> 03:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
to the disciplinary action now and how
 
03:07:54.590 --> 03:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
it would change
 
03:07:58.309 --> 03:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
should we adopt the recommendations sure
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
and I'll do like the broad overview so
 
03:08:03.710 --> 03:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
right now if a complaint were to come in
 
03:08:07.010 --> 03:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
from anybody they can literally come
 
03:08:10.010 --> 03:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
from anywhere including a board member
 
03:08:11.750 --> 03:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
um the office would receive that
 
03:08:14.809 --> 03:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
complaint and then depending on and
 
03:08:16.490 --> 03:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
Jess you can correct me if I get
 
03:08:18.050 --> 03:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
anything wrong but depending on the
 
03:08:19.910 --> 03:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
board some of the boards like to see the
 
03:08:21.769 --> 03:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
complaints up front some of the boards
 
03:08:24.950 --> 03:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh do not but the office would go to the
 
03:08:28.269 --> 03:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
board bring that complaint forward and
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
essentially request permission to
 
03:08:33.110 --> 03:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
investigate that once we conduct an
 
03:08:38.030 --> 03:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
investigation we put together an Roi
 
03:08:40.910 --> 03:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
report of Investigation we bring that
 
03:08:42.889 --> 03:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
back to the board the board reviewers it
 
03:08:44.469 --> 03:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
they decide
 
03:08:46.670 --> 03:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
if they want to see further
 
03:08:49.610 --> 03:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
investigation they decide if they want
 
03:08:52.309 --> 03:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
to dismiss the matter or they decide if
 
03:08:54.530 --> 03:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
they want to proceed within adjudicative
 
03:08:56.389 --> 03:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
proceeding so basically disciplinary
 
03:08:59.389 --> 03:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
proceeding if they do decide to proceed
 
03:09:01.330 --> 03:09:01.340 align:start position:0%
with discipline
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
then they'll send out a notice of
 
03:09:07.670 --> 03:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
hearing currently oplc has prosecutors
 
03:09:10.250 --> 03:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
on staff but they have to be appointed
 
03:09:13.550 --> 03:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
by the board oplc provide provides
 
03:09:16.309 --> 03:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
hearing officers who also need to be
 
03:09:18.910 --> 03:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
appointed by the board
 
03:09:22.010 --> 03:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
we go through the hearing the decisions
 
03:09:24.950 --> 03:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
legal and non-legal reside with the
 
03:09:27.830 --> 03:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
board you present a case
 
03:09:30.290 --> 03:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
sort of like a court proceeding
 
03:09:30.300 --> 03:09:30.950 align:start position:0%
sort of like a court proceeding
um

03:09:30.950 --> 03:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:33.530 --> 03:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
and and then the board makes a decision
 
03:09:36.050 --> 03:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
on the facts before them and then
 
03:09:38.630 --> 03:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
decides discipline so some of the major
 
03:09:41.450 --> 03:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
changes that we would see in
 
03:09:44.330 --> 03:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
in 655 if it were to pass as it
 
03:09:45.590 --> 03:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
currently is
 
03:09:48.769 --> 03:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
one in investigative or rather when a
 
03:09:51.410 --> 03:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
complaint were to come to the office
 
03:09:53.330 --> 03:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
we would be able to review that in the
 
03:09:56.030 --> 03:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
first instance decide if that claim is
 
03:09:59.870 --> 03:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
with Merit or has Merit on its face so
 
03:10:02.210 --> 03:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
if there's no stated violation of
 
03:10:06.050 --> 03:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
Statute or rule we would so if there
 
03:10:07.370 --> 03:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
wasn't one we would bring it to the
 
03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
board they would make the decision
 
03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not to dismiss the claim if
 
03:10:14.410 --> 03:10:14.420 align:start position:0%
there is a claim with Merit on its face
 
03:10:17.210 --> 03:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
we could immediately begin investigating
 
03:10:19.070 --> 03:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
without going to the board for
 
03:10:19.080 --> 03:10:20.170 align:start position:0%
without going to the board for
permission

03:10:20.170 --> 03:10:20.180 align:start position:0%
permission
 
03:10:23.570 --> 03:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
at The Point again whether or not to
 
03:10:25.849 --> 03:10:25.859 align:start position:0%
proceed with an adjudicative proceeding
 
03:10:27.889 --> 03:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
discipline is still in the hands of the
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
board in either scenario currently
 
03:10:30.720 --> 03:10:32.090 align:start position:0%
board in either scenario currently
though

03:10:32.090 --> 03:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
though
 
03:10:35.330 --> 03:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
or as 655 as proposed the board wouldn't
 
03:10:37.490 --> 03:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
appoint the prosecutor to the case they
 
03:10:40.490 --> 03:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
would simply be appointed by oplc and
 
03:10:43.309 --> 03:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
the board wouldn't appoint the hearing
 
03:10:43.319 --> 03:10:44.690 align:start position:0%
the board wouldn't appoint the hearing
officer

03:10:44.690 --> 03:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
officer
 
03:10:47.450 --> 03:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
they would be appointed and then also
 
03:10:50.150 --> 03:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
the hearing officer would do more of the
 
03:10:52.370 --> 03:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
calling balls and Strikes on the legal
 
03:10:54.889 --> 03:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
matters for you know objection relevancy
 
03:10:59.450 --> 03:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
kind of issues the determination uh
 
03:11:01.550 --> 03:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
03:11:04.130 --> 03:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
there is a disciplinary whether they
 
03:11:05.450 --> 03:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
should proceed with discipline or not
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
would still lie in the hands of the
 
03:11:11.570 --> 03:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
board so the current situation I if you
 
03:11:12.889 --> 03:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
look at it right now you have a
 
03:11:14.630 --> 03:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
situation where the board could file a
 
03:11:16.910 --> 03:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
complaint appoint the investigator to
 
03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
the matter appoint the prosecutor to the
 
03:11:20.570 --> 03:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
matter appoint the hearing officer to
 
03:11:23.510 --> 03:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
the matter sit in and act as the jury in
 
03:11:26.690 --> 03:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
the matter make legal and non-legal
 
03:11:28.910 --> 03:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
determinations and decide discipline
 
03:11:31.730 --> 03:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
we're trying to sort of separate some of
 
03:11:34.190 --> 03:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
those roles and responsibilities give
 
03:11:37.969 --> 03:11:37.979 align:start position:0%
oplc the investigative proceeding let an
 
03:11:41.450 --> 03:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
oplc hearing officer make the legal
 
03:11:43.849 --> 03:11:43.859 align:start position:0%
determinations again like relevancy kind
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
of stuff the jury or the jury well it's
 
03:11:49.849 --> 03:11:49.859 align:start position:0%
a good analogy under the new Under the
 
03:11:51.050 --> 03:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
new set
 
03:11:52.910 --> 03:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
um so the hearing officer would act more
 
03:11:55.250 --> 03:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
and more like a judge role it's not a
 
03:11:57.950 --> 03:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
judge role but in a similar fashion and
 
03:12:01.490 --> 03:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
the board would act more in that sort of
 
03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert and jury role and
 
03:12:06.349 --> 03:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
that would be the difference between the
 
03:12:08.809 --> 03:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
process as it is now and the process
 
03:12:12.230 --> 03:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
under 655 as it's written
 
03:12:14.990 --> 03:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
in here so just to see if I'm
 
03:12:16.610 --> 03:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly I'm going to use
 
03:12:17.870 --> 03:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
an analogy
 
03:12:20.150 --> 03:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
for the the current process and let me
 
03:12:22.610 --> 03:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
know if it fits and that's uh that
 
03:12:24.889 --> 03:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
basically now the board acts you know is
 
03:12:26.809 --> 03:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
sort of legal you know criminal thing
 
03:12:28.670 --> 03:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
would be the police doing the
 
03:12:30.710 --> 03:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
investigation the prosecutor Prosecuting
 
03:12:34.130 --> 03:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
acuting the case uh the judge overseeing
 
03:12:36.370 --> 03:12:36.380 align:start position:0%
the trial and the jury
 
03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
and the sentencing decision all right
 
03:12:42.830 --> 03:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
now right is that correct all well-being
 
03:12:44.269 --> 03:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
Market participants
 
03:12:50.269 --> 03:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have a question
 
03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:53.210 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have a question
um

03:12:53.210 --> 03:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:58.010 --> 03:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
the current process of the board naming
 
03:13:01.370 --> 03:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
a prosecutor and or hearing officer
 
03:13:04.429 --> 03:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
I assume they have a pool of people that
 
03:13:07.130 --> 03:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
they pick from to do those would that be
 
03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
the same pool that ophail c would be
 
03:13:10.969 --> 03:13:10.979 align:start position:0%
using it is the same group of
 
03:13:13.550 --> 03:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
individuals we currently employ three
 
03:13:15.530 --> 03:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
prosecutors who were assigned the cases
 
03:13:19.130 --> 03:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
from the boards we have uh currently two
 
03:13:22.309 --> 03:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
hearings officers as well one of them is
 
03:13:24.889 --> 03:13:24.899 align:start position:0%
currently out on paternity leave but it
 
03:13:27.889 --> 03:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
would be the same pool of people the the
 
03:13:30.170 --> 03:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
big difference though would be being
 
03:13:32.150 --> 03:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
able to call those balls and Strikes and
 
03:13:33.650 --> 03:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
if the board didn't like a legal
 
03:13:35.570 --> 03:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
determination they wouldn't be able to
 
03:13:43.969 --> 03:13:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:46.130 --> 03:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
another thing that was sort of expressed
 
03:13:47.630 --> 03:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
to me and I don't necessarily fully
 
03:13:49.370 --> 03:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
understand it but
 
03:13:51.410 --> 03:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
is there some point in this process
 
03:13:53.990 --> 03:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
whereby being accused you lose your
 
03:13:56.269 --> 03:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
prerogatives to do certain things are
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
suspended or
 
03:14:02.510 --> 03:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh and would they get better or worse or
 
03:14:05.690 --> 03:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
I think that's probably more situational
 
03:14:08.690 --> 03:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
you don't lose anything Simply Be by
 
03:14:12.530 --> 03:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
being accused all of the complaints are
 
03:14:14.570 --> 03:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
confidential and the investigations are
 
03:14:17.330 --> 03:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
confidential there come could come to a
 
03:14:19.309 --> 03:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
point where if the matter is decided to
 
03:14:21.710 --> 03:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
move forward with discipline uh you can
 
03:14:24.349 --> 03:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
sign a preliminary agreement not to
 
03:14:26.269 --> 03:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
practice there are settlement options
 
03:14:26.279 --> 03:14:27.130 align:start position:0%
practice there are settlement options
available

03:14:27.130 --> 03:14:27.140 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:14:30.550 --> 03:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
there is also situations for emergencies
 
03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
where uh for the you know in an
 
03:14:36.349 --> 03:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
emergency situation for the public
 
03:14:39.290 --> 03:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
benefit welfare health and safety the
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
board can decide to suspend someone's
 
03:14:45.170 --> 03:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
license but they are obligated to hold a
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
hearing within 10 days
 
03:14:50.570 --> 03:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
does that answer the question since I
 
03:14:51.830 --> 03:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
don't really fully know what the
 
03:14:55.730 --> 03:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:57.830 --> 03:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that brings up a good point
 
03:15:00.110 --> 03:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
if um
 
03:15:04.429 --> 03:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
are there time are there deadlines
 
03:15:08.690 --> 03:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
in this in the new system that would
 
03:15:10.910 --> 03:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
require certain things to be done by
 
03:15:13.969 --> 03:15:13.979 align:start position:0%
certain times there are um and I think
 
03:15:16.490 --> 03:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
they'd be more uniform currently you can
 
03:15:18.110 --> 03:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
go to the board statutes and depending
 
03:15:19.309 --> 03:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
on what
 
03:15:23.170 --> 03:15:23.180 align:start position:0%
uh statute you're in you can have to
 
03:15:25.550 --> 03:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
hearing notice is a good example and
 
03:15:27.710 --> 03:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
probably the one we come across most
 
03:15:31.429 --> 03:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
often some boards require 10 days notice
 
03:15:33.830 --> 03:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
14 days notice 15 days notice one board
 
03:15:35.809 --> 03:15:35.819 align:start position:0%
I think has 30 days notice this would
 
03:15:38.330 --> 03:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
standardize that and say at least 15
 
03:15:40.490 --> 03:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
days before a hearing the notice would
 
03:15:42.410 --> 03:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
go out but we we did build in those
 
03:15:44.929 --> 03:15:44.939 align:start position:0%
those timelines that already exist we
 
03:15:47.990 --> 03:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
just sort of standardized them
 
03:15:50.510 --> 03:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
so what are the sources of complaints I
 
03:15:52.309 --> 03:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
mean how you know can you give me
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
examples of many types of complaints
 
03:15:57.710 --> 03:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
that you receive yeah they come from all
 
03:16:00.050 --> 03:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
over the place uh some of the types of
 
03:16:01.490 --> 03:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
cases that would be dismissed I'm going
 
03:16:02.929 --> 03:16:02.939 align:start position:0%
to use this one because executive
 
03:16:04.790 --> 03:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
director Courtney loves this example
 
03:16:07.969 --> 03:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
they gave me the wrong flavor jello that
 
03:16:09.769 --> 03:16:09.779 align:start position:0%
would be the kind of case that we would
 
03:16:11.170 --> 03:16:11.180 align:start position:0%
probably dismiss
 
03:16:14.090 --> 03:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
originally depending on the board
 
03:16:16.370 --> 03:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
there's sometimes
 
03:16:16.380 --> 03:16:17.750 align:start position:0%
there's sometimes
um

03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:20.269 --> 03:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh sexual physical abuse kind of
 
03:16:24.250 --> 03:16:24.260 align:start position:0%
complaints drug diversion complaints
 
03:16:26.450 --> 03:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
practicing without a license or
 
03:16:29.389 --> 03:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
practicing with an expired license or
 
03:16:32.389 --> 03:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
some of the more common complaints uh
 
03:16:34.370 --> 03:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
do these do these come from the
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement arm or do they come I'm
 
03:16:38.090 --> 03:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how many of your
 
03:16:39.769 --> 03:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
complaints come from enforcement
 
03:16:41.870 --> 03:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
regulations like you for example the
 
03:16:44.510 --> 03:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement team going out and how many
 
03:16:46.849 --> 03:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
like let's say the result of an
 
03:16:49.130 --> 03:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
inspection and how many are from the
 
03:16:50.870 --> 03:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
public themselves
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
the vast majority are from the public
 
03:16:56.870 --> 03:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and the public could be a consumer
 
03:16:59.030 --> 03:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
who got a service from a licensee it
 
03:17:01.610 --> 03:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
could be another licensee who
 
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
is in competition with that person it
 
03:17:05.510 --> 03:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
could be a licensee that works with that
 
03:17:07.429 --> 03:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
person it could be their employer it
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
could be the family member of someone
 
03:17:11.870 --> 03:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
who had a service by a licensee it could
 
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
be a lawsuit because the courts have to
 
03:17:15.710 --> 03:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
notify us regarding
 
03:17:18.469 --> 03:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
um lawsuits in medical cases
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
um it could be
 
03:17:21.710 --> 03:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different anyone can
 
03:17:23.090 --> 03:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
file a complaint
 
03:17:25.250 --> 03:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority do come from the
 
03:17:25.260 --> 03:17:26.510 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority do come from the
public

03:17:26.510 --> 03:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:17:28.250 --> 03:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and that I use that very generally
 
03:17:29.990 --> 03:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
and broadly
 
03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:30.710 align:start position:0%
and broadly
um

03:17:30.710 --> 03:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:32.570 --> 03:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
there are some that certainly come
 
03:17:34.370 --> 03:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
through inspections which you know we
 
03:17:35.690 --> 03:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
have inspectors for borrower and
 
03:17:38.349 --> 03:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and Aesthetics Pharmacy
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
electrical and mechanical
 
03:17:43.070 --> 03:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
um so there are times that they find
 
03:17:45.530 --> 03:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
come across something and it ends up
 
03:17:47.690 --> 03:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
resulting in a complaint but the vast
 
03:17:53.150 --> 03:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:55.429 --> 03:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
so one of the questions I remember one
 
03:17:57.710 --> 03:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
of the concerns I mean there's there's
 
03:17:59.269 --> 03:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
such a variety
 
03:18:01.550 --> 03:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
of boards
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
so I think it does make sense to have
 
03:18:06.530 --> 03:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
standard deadlines and a standard form
 
03:18:08.809 --> 03:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
of because this is
 
03:18:10.849 --> 03:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
this it all has to do with protecting
 
03:18:12.769 --> 03:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
the public right I mean that's why we
 
03:18:15.290 --> 03:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
have this so
 
03:18:15.300 --> 03:18:16.309 align:start position:0%
have this so
um

03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:19.309 --> 03:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
in the case of
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
I can see how in the case of a
 
03:18:25.370 --> 03:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
um someone who's providing a service
 
03:18:29.030 --> 03:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
like I don't know I'm gonna pick um
 
03:18:31.130 --> 03:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
esthetician right then they burn
 
03:18:32.929 --> 03:18:32.939 align:start position:0%
somebody's face or something like that
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
but then that's I can see that how does
 
03:18:39.290 --> 03:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
how do elect how do complaints from the
 
03:18:42.349 --> 03:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
technical boards arise because is it
 
03:18:45.170 --> 03:18:45.180 align:start position:0%
that they don't follow the building
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
codes or they don't I'm trying to figure
 
03:18:49.550 --> 03:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
out how it is that that's because there
 
03:18:51.769 --> 03:18:51.779 align:start position:0%
seemed there were some concerns and the
 
03:18:54.110 --> 03:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
electrical board
 
03:18:58.269 --> 03:18:58.279 align:start position:0%
on how this was going to affect them
 
03:19:00.769 --> 03:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
electrical complaints I think primarily
 
03:19:03.290 --> 03:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
are primarily not exclusively but
 
03:19:05.210 --> 03:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
primarily homeowners who hired an
 
03:19:07.130 --> 03:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
electrician to do something and they
 
03:19:09.469 --> 03:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
didn't finish didn't do it right there's
 
03:19:12.050 --> 03:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
some other issue with with the work that
 
03:19:17.349 --> 03:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:20.210 --> 03:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
so how would you oh I'm sorry go ahead I
 
03:19:23.330 --> 03:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
was gonna say um I also
 
03:19:25.990 --> 03:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
I spoke with Steve Rancourt who's
 
03:19:27.889 --> 03:19:27.899 align:start position:0%
appeared and I think one of the big
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
concerns too isn't even so much with the
 
03:19:33.170 --> 03:19:33.180 align:start position:0%
lplc process but with the appeal process
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
after the board makes a decision uh
 
03:19:35.760 --> 03:19:37.250 align:start position:0%
after the board makes a decision uh
currently

03:19:37.250 --> 03:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:19:39.710 --> 03:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
most of the boards can appeal to the
 
03:19:42.469 --> 03:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court the electrician's board
 
03:19:48.170 --> 03:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
had a different path and I that was in
 
03:19:51.769 --> 03:19:51.779 align:start position:0%
SB 107 the repeal of that and and I
 
03:19:54.230 --> 03:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
presented last was it last week was it
 
03:19:57.170 --> 03:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
only last week but
 
03:20:01.610 --> 03:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
uh house Edna I suggested I just flagged
 
03:20:03.170 --> 03:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
it and said if if they're going to pull
 
03:20:05.510 --> 03:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
the other things from 655 that might
 
03:20:08.570 --> 03:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
also be language to appeal but I I think
 
03:20:11.030 --> 03:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of their concerns in talking with
 
03:20:12.889 --> 03:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
Steve and
 
03:20:17.389 --> 03:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
oddly he's not here to correct me uh
 
03:20:19.070 --> 03:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's why I brought it up yeah they
 
03:20:21.530 --> 03:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
stem I think from that piece and not so
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
much the oplc process I'm sure he'll
 
03:20:25.210 --> 03:20:25.220 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm
 
03:20:28.070 --> 03:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting that
 
03:20:31.190 --> 03:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um so just to get a feel for
 
03:20:32.809 --> 03:20:32.819 align:start position:0%
some of this I'm sure it varies widely
 
03:20:34.730 --> 03:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
by profession or board
 
03:20:37.969 --> 03:20:37.979 align:start position:0%
but What proportion of complaints
 
03:20:40.490 --> 03:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
actually result in some disciplinary
 
03:20:42.590 --> 03:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
action as opposed to end up being
 
03:20:42.600 --> 03:20:43.910 align:start position:0%
action as opposed to end up being
dismissed

03:20:43.910 --> 03:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
dismissed
 
03:20:50.330 --> 03:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:50.340 --> 03:20:52.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:20:52.030 --> 03:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:55.190 --> 03:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
we don't currently track that although
 
03:20:56.690 --> 03:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
we are certainly working on
 
03:20:58.610 --> 03:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
technological solutions so that we can
 
03:21:00.469 --> 03:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
because I agree that is a very important
 
03:21:02.990 --> 03:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
piece of information to have
 
03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:05.090 align:start position:0%
piece of information to have
um

03:21:05.090 --> 03:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
I really wouldn't want to even even
 
03:21:09.050 --> 03:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
guess and then when you talk about how
 
03:21:11.030 --> 03:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
much results in discipline is that you
 
03:21:12.650 --> 03:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
know goes to adjudication and discipline
 
03:21:14.450 --> 03:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
is imposed does that include settlements
 
03:21:16.070 --> 03:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
does that include other things or not
 
03:21:18.110 --> 03:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
those are things unfortunately we just
 
03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't track okay and that's more
 
03:21:21.650 --> 03:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
thinking which got dismissed as being
 
03:21:23.269 --> 03:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
more or less
 
03:21:26.030 --> 03:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
baseless as opposed to something that
 
03:21:28.790 --> 03:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
goes further I mean is it half to get
 
03:21:32.750 --> 03:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
dismissed 90 10 just vaguely if you can
 
03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
if you can't yeah that's fine I can't
 
03:21:36.290 --> 03:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
what I can say is it does vary somewhat
 
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
by board
 
03:21:39.170 --> 03:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
um some boards like Board of Nursing
 
03:21:40.969 --> 03:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
they review every single complaint and
 
03:21:43.849 --> 03:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
they decide to dismiss the ones that are
 
03:21:46.070 --> 03:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
invalid on their face and then the ones
 
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
that are not we you know move through
 
03:21:49.450 --> 03:21:49.460 align:start position:0%
the process at least to The Next Step
 
03:21:51.769 --> 03:21:51.779 align:start position:0%
other boards don't want to see the
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
complaints so we at least have to
 
03:21:55.610 --> 03:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
request a response and then they might
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
look at it some boards real estate it
 
03:21:58.910 --> 03:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
says something to the effect of you
 
03:22:01.130 --> 03:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
shall investigate everything so it needs
 
03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
to go further so
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
they're depending on the board it's
 
03:22:07.969 --> 03:22:07.979 align:start position:0%
going to go to a various you know
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
different various point in the process
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:22:15.710 --> 03:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
so then the intention of this new
 
03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
protocol would be that oplc would decide
 
03:22:21.950 --> 03:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
they would be that they would be the
 
03:22:23.870 --> 03:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
first Junction right in the decision
 
03:22:23.880 --> 03:22:26.830 align:start position:0%
first Junction right in the decision
tree

03:22:26.830 --> 03:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:30.170 --> 03:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
we would review a complaint in the first
 
03:22:32.450 --> 03:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
instance but nothing would get dismissed
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
without bringing it to the board
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
even in the new even in the new so if we
 
03:22:39.650 --> 03:22:39.660 align:start position:0%
see a complaint and we think it's
 
03:22:41.330 --> 03:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
without Merit we might make a
 
03:22:43.490 --> 03:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the board you know
 
03:22:45.290 --> 03:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
this is a wrong Jello flavor kind of
 
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
case but we aren't making that decision
 
03:22:49.610 --> 03:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
or weeding anything out without
 
03:22:51.469 --> 03:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
consulting the board
 
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay so how do we and and you want to
 
03:22:57.110 --> 03:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
stay with that
 
03:22:59.570 --> 03:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
you want to stay okay so
 
03:23:04.090 --> 03:23:04.100 align:start position:0%
um how do we then create language
 
03:23:08.150 --> 03:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
that says that because if we if we just
 
03:23:11.150 --> 03:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
pull out disciplinary actions it's it's
 
03:23:13.490 --> 03:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
not really
 
03:23:17.630 --> 03:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
accurate as to what's being what's
 
03:23:19.849 --> 03:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
happening right so you can see how this
 
03:23:21.469 --> 03:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
is causing
 
03:23:23.570 --> 03:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of angst because it's sort of
 
03:23:26.570 --> 03:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
confusing to me too so how do we in
 
03:23:26.580 --> 03:23:28.370 align:start position:0%
confusing to me too so how do we in
statute

03:23:28.370 --> 03:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:23:28.380 --> 03:23:31.130 align:start position:0%
statute
Define

03:23:31.130 --> 03:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
Define
 
03:23:34.610 --> 03:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
at what point is the Baton get tossed
 
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:43.130 --> 03:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking through the language of
 
03:23:46.070 --> 03:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
655 as it currently stands I'm on page
 
03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
13 of the PDF line four boards shall
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
conduct disciplinary and
 
03:23:53.510 --> 03:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinarian remedial proceedings
 
03:23:55.870 --> 03:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
in accordance with procedural rules
 
03:23:58.429 --> 03:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
adopted by the executive director I'm
 
03:24:00.050 --> 03:24:00.060 align:start position:0%
going to keep looking at the language to
 
03:24:01.610 --> 03:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
see if it's more specific in here I
 
03:24:03.950 --> 03:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't have it memorized but there is all
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
I mean the jail care process it's a rule
 
03:24:08.750 --> 03:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
the formal rule making process so we
 
03:24:11.330 --> 03:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
would have to bring everything currently
 
03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
they're the PLC 200s but we would have
 
03:24:17.510 --> 03:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
okay so what you're saying is you're
 
03:24:22.849 --> 03:24:22.859 align:start position:0%
taking that portion out of statute
 
03:24:25.090 --> 03:24:25.100 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't have the rule making
 
03:24:28.370 --> 03:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
process handle that part of that was in
 
03:24:28.380 --> 03:24:31.190 align:start position:0%
process handle that part of that was in
statue

03:24:31.190 --> 03:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
including concerning the disciplinary
 
03:24:36.050 --> 03:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
action right correct you're repealing
 
03:24:38.750 --> 03:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action from everything and
 
03:24:40.849 --> 03:24:40.859 align:start position:0%
you're putting it in the rulemaking of
 
03:24:44.210 --> 03:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
oplc and oplc would be therefore setting
 
03:24:47.150 --> 03:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
the rules of the new procedure for some
 
03:24:49.309 --> 03:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
of it some of the things in the bill are
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
the presiding officer appointments or in
 
03:24:56.750 --> 03:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
the language of 655 the prosecutors is
 
03:25:00.110 --> 03:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
actually specifically in 655
 
03:25:00.120 --> 03:25:03.650 align:start position:0%
actually specifically in 655
um

03:25:03.650 --> 03:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:03.660 --> 03:25:06.170 align:start position:0%
 
let's

03:25:06.170 --> 03:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
let's
 
03:25:10.010 --> 03:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh section seven of
 
03:25:13.309 --> 03:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
three ten ten currently
 
03:25:16.370 --> 03:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
page 13 line 31 board shall be the
 
03:25:19.370 --> 03:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
triers of fact in all disciplinary and
 
03:25:21.530 --> 03:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary remedial proceedings
 
03:25:24.410 --> 03:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
and shall determine sanctions if any so
 
03:25:34.429 --> 03:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:39.250 --> 03:25:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:44.510 --> 03:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
are you looking at 655 yes the original
 
03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:48.469 align:start position:0%
are you looking at 655 yes the original
one

03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:25:50.090 --> 03:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I believe this is the one that was
 
03:25:52.070 --> 03:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
amended by the house oh the amended
 
03:25:55.790 --> 03:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:55.800 --> 03:25:56.929 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:25:56.929 --> 03:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:00.349 --> 03:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:02.570 --> 03:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
line 11.
 
03:26:05.090 --> 03:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
upon receipt of an allegation of
 
03:26:07.070 --> 03:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
professional misconduct the office shall
 
03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
determine whether the allegation States
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
a viable claim if the office determines
 
03:26:13.729 --> 03:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
that the allegation is not viable it
 
03:26:15.349 --> 03:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
shall make a recommendation to the board
 
03:26:17.750 --> 03:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
for dismissal the board shall review the
 
03:26:19.550 --> 03:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
office's recommendation and dismiss the
 
03:26:21.469 --> 03:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
allegation if it determines that the
 
03:26:23.269 --> 03:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
allegation does not State a claim of
 
03:26:25.610 --> 03:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
professional misconduct so will the
 
03:26:27.290 --> 03:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
office could make a recommendation that
 
03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
decision would still reside with the
 
03:26:28.800 --> 03:26:33.170 align:start position:0%
decision would still reside with the
board

03:26:33.170 --> 03:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:38.210 --> 03:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:40.670 --> 03:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
correct but
 
03:26:44.030 --> 03:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
six the language of 655 does not change
 
03:26:45.889 --> 03:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
the fact that the board has final
 
03:26:48.469 --> 03:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
disposition like final say in the final
 
03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
disposition of
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
every matter whether it's dismissed at
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
some point or goes to adjudication that
 
03:26:57.410 --> 03:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
is still within the board's control and
 
03:26:57.420 --> 03:26:58.910 align:start position:0%
is still within the board's control and
Authority

03:26:58.910 --> 03:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
03:27:01.070 --> 03:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
that is still their decision
 
03:27:03.410 --> 03:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
okay then how do we oh I'm sorry do you
 
03:27:09.410 --> 03:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
how do we then
 
03:27:13.490 --> 03:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
um separate see I'm trying to go I'm
 
03:27:15.290 --> 03:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
going back to the okay this is they're
 
03:27:18.110 --> 03:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
the jury and there's this investigation
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
so you've done the investigation you've
 
03:27:23.690 --> 03:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
determined that it doesn't meet the it
 
03:27:25.729 --> 03:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
it doesn't you're you're thinking that
 
03:27:27.530 --> 03:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
it should be dismissed
 
03:27:29.210 --> 03:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
and then you're sending it to the board
 
03:27:31.610 --> 03:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
the jury to decide whether or not that
 
03:27:32.809 --> 03:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
is the case
 
03:27:35.809 --> 03:27:35.819 align:start position:0%
and let's say they say it is that they
 
03:27:37.490 --> 03:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's they think that
 
03:27:38.809 --> 03:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
it's a real
 
03:27:42.889 --> 03:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
complaint then what happens after that
 
03:27:46.250 --> 03:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
so once we complete an investigation the
 
03:27:48.410 --> 03:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
report of Investigation or Roi with a
 
03:27:50.330 --> 03:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
recommendation goes to the board
 
03:27:53.630 --> 03:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
and this happens now as well it goes to
 
03:27:54.889 --> 03:27:54.899 align:start position:0%
the board with a recommendation let's
 
03:27:56.929 --> 03:27:56.939 align:start position:0%
say we don't believe there's sufficient
 
03:28:00.410 --> 03:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
facts to support adjudication in this
 
03:28:02.750 --> 03:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
matter the board could certainly with
 
03:28:04.969 --> 03:28:04.979 align:start position:0%
their expertise in that profession feel
 
03:28:06.889 --> 03:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
differently and they could say we do
 
03:28:08.450 --> 03:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
believe that this this should be
 
03:28:10.370 --> 03:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
adjudicated so they don't have to accept
 
03:28:13.070 --> 03:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
our recommendation they would review the
 
03:28:14.990 --> 03:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
ROI and they would make a final
 
03:28:17.330 --> 03:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
determination whether they agree with us
 
03:28:19.309 --> 03:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
or not they can that's
 
03:28:21.950 --> 03:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
up to them
 
03:28:24.110 --> 03:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
and if they they think that it needs
 
03:28:27.110 --> 03:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
further investigation then what have do
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
you do you pick it up do you do they
 
03:28:30.590 --> 03:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
throw it back to you
 
03:28:33.410 --> 03:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
so if we have submitted an Roi at that
 
03:28:34.969 --> 03:28:34.979 align:start position:0%
point we consider the investigation
 
03:28:37.190 --> 03:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
completed if they determine there's some
 
03:28:38.990 --> 03:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
aspect that needs further investigation
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
they can certainly send it back to us
 
03:28:42.290 --> 03:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
with instructions you need to do further
 
03:28:45.190 --> 03:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
investigation in this area
 
03:28:48.229 --> 03:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
but at that point generally a decision
 
03:28:50.210 --> 03:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
would be made whether to dismiss or go
 
03:28:51.469 --> 03:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
to adjudication because the
 
03:28:55.610 --> 03:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
investigation is complete
 
03:28:55.620 --> 03:28:58.729 align:start position:0%
investigation is complete
management

03:28:58.729 --> 03:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:02.889 --> 03:29:02.899 align:start position:0%
okay so it seems to me like we're I
 
03:29:05.690 --> 03:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
debating how many angels you can fit on
 
03:29:08.450 --> 03:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
the edge of a PIN to some degree here
 
03:29:08.460 --> 03:29:10.010 align:start position:0%
the edge of a PIN to some degree here
because

03:29:10.010 --> 03:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
um uh the the real question it seems to
 
03:29:15.889 --> 03:29:15.899 align:start position:0%
me is like what you
 
03:29:18.889 --> 03:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
um are going to be uh
 
03:29:21.590 --> 03:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
how you're going to be handling things
 
03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
um and the I as I understand the idea of
 
03:29:27.469 --> 03:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
the oplc is that you're going to be
 
03:29:30.370 --> 03:29:30.380 align:start position:0%
providing expertise in areas in which
 
03:29:34.610 --> 03:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
the the various different boards do not
 
03:29:37.610 --> 03:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
have expertise so
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
um the oplc hypothetically doesn't know
 
03:29:43.309 --> 03:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
anything about medicine
 
03:29:45.710 --> 03:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't know anything about Dentistry
 
03:29:47.990 --> 03:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't know anything about Plumbing
 
03:29:50.090 --> 03:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
about electricity any of that kind of
 
03:29:50.100 --> 03:29:51.650 align:start position:0%
about electricity any of that kind of
stuff

03:29:51.650 --> 03:29:51.660 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
03:29:55.130 --> 03:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
so to the degree that you got some kind
 
03:29:56.510 --> 03:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
of a complaint
 
03:29:58.130 --> 03:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
what is it going to be
 
03:30:02.210 --> 03:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
is it going to be that the contractor uh
 
03:30:04.510 --> 03:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
defrauded customer
 
03:30:07.250 --> 03:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
stole property out of the customer's
 
03:30:07.260 --> 03:30:09.370 align:start position:0%
stole property out of the customer's
house

03:30:09.370 --> 03:30:09.380 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:30:11.990 --> 03:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
engaged in in various different things
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
which are crimes
 
03:30:17.389 --> 03:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
we we don't have to get involved in any
 
03:30:19.070 --> 03:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
of that because crimes are crimes
 
03:30:20.929 --> 03:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
they're already illegal the only
 
03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
question is is the board
 
03:30:27.170 --> 03:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
a good Trier of fact and when because
 
03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
they may be good doctors good dentists
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
good electricians good plumbers but they
 
03:30:34.490 --> 03:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
may not be good lawyers
 
03:30:37.010 --> 03:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
that's where you guys come in so the
 
03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
question is do you have good process
 
03:30:41.389 --> 03:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
that's why you provide legal counsel
 
03:30:44.530 --> 03:30:44.540 align:start position:0%
that's why we have several attorneys
 
03:30:48.710 --> 03:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
including yourself Mr osad so I don't
 
03:30:50.570 --> 03:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
think we have to I don't think we have
 
03:30:52.910 --> 03:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
to get involved in any of that the the
 
03:30:57.050 --> 03:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
idea of oplc is to provide legal counsel
 
03:30:58.790 --> 03:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
so that you have
 
03:31:00.889 --> 03:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
procedures which are legal and you don't
 
03:31:00.899 --> 03:31:01.969 align:start position:0%
procedures which are legal and you don't
have

03:31:01.969 --> 03:31:01.979 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:31:04.849 --> 03:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
board members who don't have any
 
03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
expertise in the law may not even know
 
03:31:09.190 --> 03:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
what the law is
 
03:31:12.290 --> 03:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
and so they may be saying well such and
 
03:31:15.469 --> 03:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
such and so and so and the board lawyer
 
03:31:18.650 --> 03:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
who's part of the trial says that that's
 
03:31:18.660 --> 03:31:20.050 align:start position:0%
who's part of the trial says that that's
improper

03:31:20.050 --> 03:31:20.060 align:start position:0%
improper
 
03:31:23.150 --> 03:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're jumping to whatever it
 
03:31:26.090 --> 03:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
might be where you have that expertise I
 
03:31:27.590 --> 03:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't think we have to get involved in
 
03:31:29.330 --> 03:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
any of this frankly to the degree that
 
03:31:31.849 --> 03:31:31.859 align:start position:0%
you were that no PLC is going to be
 
03:31:34.870 --> 03:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
providing the administrative Services
 
03:31:40.610 --> 03:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
which are needed for good operation
 
03:31:43.010 --> 03:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
that's what that's that that's the
 
03:31:45.290 --> 03:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
structure that you are already setting
 
03:31:47.570 --> 03:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
up uh and we don't I don't think we have
 
03:31:49.969 --> 03:31:49.979 align:start position:0%
to get involved in specifics of any of
 
03:31:51.650 --> 03:31:51.660 align:start position:0%
this frankly
 
03:31:54.769 --> 03:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
management we do because in-house Bill 2
 
03:31:58.729 --> 03:31:58.739 align:start position:0%
and in-house Bill 655 and in any kind of
 
03:32:01.130 --> 03:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
amendment that we would recommend would
 
03:32:03.469 --> 03:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
have to include somewhere in that
 
03:32:05.870 --> 03:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that we are removing the
 
03:32:08.690 --> 03:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action requirement from the
 
03:32:12.410 --> 03:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:14.450 --> 03:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
ultimately I think that's right that's
 
03:32:16.729 --> 03:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
why we're having this discussion so and
 
03:32:18.349 --> 03:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that you that you're okay with
 
03:32:20.210 --> 03:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
it because I think we're all okay with
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
it yes
 
03:32:21.359 --> 03:32:23.150 align:start position:0%
it yes
okay

03:32:23.150 --> 03:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:32:26.150 --> 03:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
so if we can now what the other the
 
03:32:28.309 --> 03:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
other item is there anybody
 
03:32:31.729 --> 03:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
who wants to raise their hand yes
 
03:32:33.530 --> 03:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
this is this is just about just we're
 
03:32:34.610 --> 03:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
not talking about the medical review
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
board yet so don't that's it that's a
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
whole different thing
 
03:32:38.399 --> 03:32:39.710 align:start position:0%
whole different thing
okay

03:32:39.710 --> 03:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:32:45.950 --> 03:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:01.670 --> 03:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the record John
 
03:33:02.990 --> 03:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
dejoy representing the New Hampshire
 
03:33:05.809 --> 03:33:05.819 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association as well as the
 
03:33:07.490 --> 03:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
National Association of Social Workers
 
03:33:09.110 --> 03:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire chapter both
 
03:33:10.729 --> 03:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
membership organizations for
 
03:33:13.150 --> 03:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
psychologists and for social workers
 
03:33:16.370 --> 03:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
there are three outstanding issues that
 
03:33:18.889 --> 03:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
the psychologists have raised in the
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
Senate testimony as well as here and
 
03:33:23.630 --> 03:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
there is one outstanding issue that the
 
03:33:25.130 --> 03:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
social workers raised that I'd like to
 
03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention I would like to
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank the committee though for the
 
03:33:30.889 --> 03:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
extensive work you did on protecting the
 
03:33:32.809 --> 03:33:32.819 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of mental health records
 
03:33:34.790 --> 03:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
for clients there were multiple Pages
 
03:33:36.410 --> 03:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
you added so thank you very much for
 
03:33:38.809 --> 03:33:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:41.210 --> 03:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
the three issues are
 
03:33:44.210 --> 03:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
the first is the oplc has to retain
 
03:33:46.429 --> 03:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
re relevant to the investigative process
 
03:33:53.809 --> 03:33:53.819 align:start position:0%
what makes a subject matter expert is
 
03:33:56.450 --> 03:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
not defined in the statute that's one of
 
03:33:58.610 --> 03:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
the areas that we have asked in the
 
03:34:01.090 --> 03:34:01.100 align:start position:0%
Senate that
 
03:34:03.889 --> 03:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
specific rules be required around what
 
03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
makes the subject matter expert
 
03:34:08.510 --> 03:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
We Believe oplc has rules in their
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
existing structure to do that it was
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
just to put it front and center of what
 
03:34:15.769 --> 03:34:15.779 align:start position:0%
makes a subject matter expert for a
 
03:34:17.450 --> 03:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
psychologist versus a social worker
 
03:34:18.830 --> 03:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
versus a mental health counselor so
 
03:34:20.690 --> 03:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
that's important
 
03:34:23.210 --> 03:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
the second piece that only applies to
 
03:34:25.490 --> 03:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
the psychologists are the relative the
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
definitions of allegations complaints
 
03:34:30.410 --> 03:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
investigations and they're used
 
03:34:32.450 --> 03:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes synonymously sometimes
 
03:34:34.969 --> 03:34:34.979 align:start position:0%
differently and they have the
 
03:34:36.889 --> 03:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
psychologists have concerns because they
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
have to at least annually if not
 
03:34:41.150 --> 03:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
semi-annually report to their insurers
 
03:34:43.929 --> 03:34:43.939 align:start position:0%
that they are not under any kind of
 
03:34:46.130 --> 03:34:46.140 align:start position:0%
Investigation or complaint process and
 
03:34:48.429 --> 03:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
they want to be using the same words
 
03:34:51.229 --> 03:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
Mis calipalitis reached out to me
 
03:34:53.210 --> 03:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
yesterday she's asked to meet with my
 
03:34:55.790 --> 03:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
clients to work those definitional
 
03:34:57.170 --> 03:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
issues out and that's what we're going
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
to be taking that on
 
03:35:03.229 --> 03:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
the third piece is in the sanctions
 
03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
under the sanctions if a person is
 
03:35:10.429 --> 03:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
adjudicated as committing malpractice
 
03:35:13.210 --> 03:35:13.220 align:start position:0%
the board May
 
03:35:16.090 --> 03:35:16.100 align:start position:0%
recoup normal investigative
 
03:35:20.210 --> 03:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
costs from the person who was found who
 
03:35:22.130 --> 03:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
was adjudicated to committed malpractice
 
03:35:24.530 --> 03:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
we have no issue with that however the
 
03:35:26.630 --> 03:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
current statute limits that
 
03:35:28.729 --> 03:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
investigative recruitment to ten
 
03:35:30.229 --> 03:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment to 655 takes that cap out
 
03:35:37.130 --> 03:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
we would like to see that cap even
 
03:35:38.690 --> 03:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
understanding that most investigations
 
03:35:41.389 --> 03:35:41.399 align:start position:0%
would not get to that level we'd like to
 
03:35:43.429 --> 03:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
see that ten thousand dollar cap stay in
 
03:35:46.010 --> 03:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
place so that folks understand the
 
03:35:47.330 --> 03:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
ultimate limit that they could be
 
03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
03:35:51.170 --> 03:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
and that's it
 
03:35:56.210 --> 03:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:56.220 --> 03:36:00.769 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:36:00.769 --> 03:36:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:03.110 --> 03:36:03.120 align:start position:0%

I'm really coming maybe I should speak
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
into the mic
 
03:36:09.950 --> 03:36:09.960 align:start position:0%

03:36:18.290 --> 03:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
and a resident of the state I'm really
 
03:36:21.050 --> 03:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
coming as a defense lawyer in medical
 
03:36:23.150 --> 03:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
malpractice cases not representing
 
03:36:25.370 --> 03:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
anyone but I think this amendment is
 
03:36:27.650 --> 03:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
troubling and so I wanted to make sure
 
03:36:31.370 --> 03:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
that those concerns are highlighted
 
03:36:33.229 --> 03:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
and against this is sort of against our
 
03:36:35.530 --> 03:36:35.540 align:start position:0%
interests this is we do represent
 
03:36:37.429 --> 03:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
Physicians when they have to come before
 
03:36:39.410 --> 03:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
the board and if there are more
 
03:36:41.330 --> 03:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
investigations that go longer and more
 
03:36:42.769 --> 03:36:42.779 align:start position:0%
complex I guess that would be good
 
03:36:44.269 --> 03:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
business for us but I just don't think
 
03:36:47.349 --> 03:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
it's the right practice as this bill is
 
03:36:50.050 --> 03:36:50.060 align:start position:0%
amending the the prior
 
03:36:53.330 --> 03:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
uh statutory scheme and so I want to lay
 
03:36:54.910 --> 03:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
out a few reasons why
 
03:36:59.269 --> 03:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment makes pretty broad changes
 
03:37:01.729 --> 03:37:01.739 align:start position:0%
to a key element that I think
 
03:37:03.349 --> 03:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt maybe was
 
03:37:05.690 --> 03:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
touching on the
 
03:37:08.450 --> 03:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
and it actually
 
03:37:09.950 --> 03:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure you're only
 
03:37:12.410 --> 03:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
talking about Physicians correct I am
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay but that's that is an important
 
03:37:17.030 --> 03:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
point because
 
03:37:19.150 --> 03:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
these are going to apply to
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
dozens of disparate boards and so that's
 
03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
a surprise to me that the Mandate for
 
03:37:28.670 --> 03:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
the oplc was to streamline the process
 
03:37:30.830 --> 03:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
their the clerical duties the
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
administrative functions that would
 
03:37:33.769 --> 03:37:33.779 align:start position:0%
probably be
 
03:37:36.229 --> 03:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
similar for all boards and to get sort
 
03:37:37.429 --> 03:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
of the economies of scale and
 
03:37:40.010 --> 03:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that's that was I think an
 
03:37:42.229 --> 03:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
idea to enhance throughput which
 
03:37:45.170 --> 03:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
everyone agrees that the long delays are
 
03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
problematic probably with every license
 
03:37:51.170 --> 03:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
board or over site board
 
03:37:53.389 --> 03:37:53.399 align:start position:0%
certainly from the standpoint of
 
03:37:57.290 --> 03:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
Physicians if if there's a long delay in
 
03:37:59.510 --> 03:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
the process a physician that was
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately going to be cleared has to
 
03:38:03.229 --> 03:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
twist on a hook for a couple of years
 
03:38:04.729 --> 03:38:04.739 align:start position:0%
that's not good
 
03:38:08.510 --> 03:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
and a physician that was using unsafe
 
03:38:10.550 --> 03:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
practices continues practicing for a
 
03:38:11.990 --> 03:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
couple years that's not good so everyone
 
03:38:14.090 --> 03:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
recognizes at least the stated problem
 
03:38:16.190 --> 03:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
was we need to make this move more
 
03:38:20.030 --> 03:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
quickly so the solution that several
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
important committees from the
 
03:38:23.929 --> 03:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
legislature in the spring in the fall
 
03:38:26.990 --> 03:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
rather completed had recommendations to
 
03:38:28.849 --> 03:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
add resources to change some of the
 
03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
rules on what a quorum would be or
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
participation telephonically in order to
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
enhance the throughput
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
and those resources might be included
 
03:38:42.530 --> 03:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
things like stipends for Physicians that
 
03:38:44.690 --> 03:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
were participating in the process and
 
03:38:46.670 --> 03:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
adding their expertise to it and that
 
03:38:49.729 --> 03:38:49.739 align:start position:0%
sort of thing so the stated problem is I
 
03:38:51.769 --> 03:38:51.779 align:start position:0%
I for shorthand keep saying throughput
 
03:38:53.690 --> 03:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
how quickly can things be adjudicated
 
03:38:53.700 --> 03:38:55.190 align:start position:0%
how quickly can things be adjudicated
adequately

03:38:55.190 --> 03:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
adequately
 
03:38:57.710 --> 03:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
the solution to that problem is to move
 
03:38:59.690 --> 03:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for a significant
 
03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
portion of discretionary activity
 
03:39:06.110 --> 03:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
to the oplc so in the case of
 
03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
that's for for Physicians but also
 
03:39:13.250 --> 03:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
electricians Architects pharmacists uh
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how taking on an additional
 
03:39:19.130 --> 03:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
set of activities of initiating and
 
03:39:21.670 --> 03:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
investigating cases is going to enhance
 
03:39:25.490 --> 03:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
the efficiencies of those administrative
 
03:39:27.769 --> 03:39:27.779 align:start position:0%
functions that the office was designed
 
03:39:31.190 --> 03:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
to take on instead now the oplc becomes
 
03:39:33.889 --> 03:39:33.899 align:start position:0%
the first decider on whether something
 
03:39:35.570 --> 03:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
should go forward and there were
 
03:39:37.550 --> 03:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
questions about if something were
 
03:39:40.190 --> 03:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
recommended for dismissal would that be
 
03:39:41.809 --> 03:39:41.819 align:start position:0%
the end of it no it was still within the
 
03:39:44.090 --> 03:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
board's purview well that's fine but one
 
03:39:46.849 --> 03:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
what's unspoken is investigations that
 
03:39:49.610 --> 03:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
the board wasn't taking up
 
03:39:53.690 --> 03:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
the board has medical expertise
 
03:39:56.690 --> 03:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
and the oplc doesn't unless it hires it
 
03:39:58.309 --> 03:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
but the board already has it with the
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
medical review subcommittee which
 
03:40:01.969 --> 03:40:01.979 align:start position:0%
historically has and currently I think
 
03:40:03.790 --> 03:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
has a radiologist
 
03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist an OB GYN a range of of
 
03:40:10.490 --> 03:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
Medical Specialties to decide here's how
 
03:40:12.590 --> 03:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
we determine the standard of care here's
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
how we determine proper practice
 
03:40:17.450 --> 03:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
moving that to the oplc doesn't enhance
 
03:40:20.570 --> 03:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
that unless they're hiring experts
 
03:40:23.870 --> 03:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
to stop you because the next topic that
 
03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about is
 
03:40:27.050 --> 03:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
specifically the Board of Medicine and
 
03:40:29.630 --> 03:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
the medical review board so that's a
 
03:40:31.370 --> 03:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
completely different thing than what
 
03:40:34.610 --> 03:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here so I mean that
 
03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
it is it would be an exception
 
03:40:38.929 --> 03:40:38.939 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're trying to figure
 
03:40:41.150 --> 03:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
out and you know the whole purpose of
 
03:40:41.160 --> 03:40:42.889 align:start position:0%
out and you know the whole purpose of
the

03:40:42.889 --> 03:40:42.899 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:40:46.429 --> 03:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
um the changes is to make sure that the
 
03:40:48.830 --> 03:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
this is that the investigation you can't
 
03:40:51.950 --> 03:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
possibly you must understand that if I
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
were to investigate and do my own
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
research and make my own decisions I'm
 
03:40:59.809 --> 03:40:59.819 align:start position:0%
going to be biased if I'm the one who's
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
sitting on the hot seat right so I think
 
03:41:04.729 --> 03:41:04.739 align:start position:0%
that it's important to understand that
 
03:41:07.250 --> 03:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
there has to be a different group of
 
03:41:09.650 --> 03:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
people doing the investigation and a
 
03:41:10.849 --> 03:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
different group of people doing the
 
03:41:13.389 --> 03:41:13.399 align:start position:0%
adjudication regardless of what
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
profession that is or do you disagree
 
03:41:18.050 --> 03:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
with that no the medical review
 
03:41:20.750 --> 03:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee does the review the board
 
03:41:22.910 --> 03:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
different Personnel I think there's one
 
03:41:25.190 --> 03:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
ex-officio member but the board has that
 
03:41:28.849 --> 03:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
Final Cut and that wouldn't change
 
03:41:31.670 --> 03:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
but that's it's like a Hobson's choice
 
03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know the story of the the guy with
 
03:41:37.250 --> 03:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
horses in London or I think it was you
 
03:41:39.950 --> 03:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
can choose any horse you want here's the
 
03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
next one so initiation of an
 
03:41:45.410 --> 03:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
investigation and proceeding with it on
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
an investigation Without Really any
 
03:41:48.120 --> 03:41:49.370 align:start position:0%
an investigation Without Really any
oversight

03:41:49.370 --> 03:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
the process is the punishment and maybe
 
03:41:54.590 --> 03:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
it wasn't appropriate why didn't that
 
03:41:57.530 --> 03:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
stay lodged with medical professionals
 
03:41:59.809 --> 03:41:59.819 align:start position:0%
as it has been and if the throughput is
 
03:42:02.210 --> 03:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
the concern we enhance that as was
 
03:42:04.250 --> 03:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
recommended in a couple of committees
 
03:42:08.090 --> 03:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
over the fall so the idea is
 
03:42:10.490 --> 03:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
the medical review subcommittee has the
 
03:42:13.190 --> 03:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
expertise to look into this and make the
 
03:42:14.450 --> 03:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
recommendation the Board of Medicine
 
03:42:17.330 --> 03:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
still has it lodging that in the oplc
 
03:42:19.490 --> 03:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
which also has dozens of other boards
 
03:42:25.130 --> 03:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:28.190 --> 03:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming up because uh again
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
I I think that we are getting into the
 
03:42:34.010 --> 03:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
we're getting into the weeds in a way
 
03:42:36.469 --> 03:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure is moving us forward
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
because as I see it the oplc its
 
03:42:42.769 --> 03:42:42.779 align:start position:0%
function is to provide
 
03:42:46.570 --> 03:42:46.580 align:start position:0%
the kind of services and expertise that
 
03:42:49.969 --> 03:42:49.979 align:start position:0%
practitioners of individual professions
 
03:42:52.610 --> 03:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
may not have at all
 
03:42:55.269 --> 03:42:55.279 align:start position:0%
and and and it it
 
03:42:59.570 --> 03:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
and to avoid a situation in which uh the
 
03:42:59.580 --> 03:43:00.790 align:start position:0%
and to avoid a situation in which uh the
the

03:43:00.790 --> 03:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:43:03.889 --> 03:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
oplc begins to meddle in things where it
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
has no expertise so we don't want the
 
03:43:09.349 --> 03:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
the administrators to tell the doctors
 
03:43:11.210 --> 03:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
how to practice medicine
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
03:43:16.429 --> 03:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
medicine I'm not talking about a doctor
 
03:43:21.170 --> 03:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
who is very bad about record keeping
 
03:43:21.180 --> 03:43:22.670 align:start position:0%
who is very bad about record keeping
or

03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:43:26.690 --> 03:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
um or who is constantly late or who is
 
03:43:26.700 --> 03:43:28.490 align:start position:0%
um or who is constantly late or who is
uh

03:43:28.490 --> 03:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to get into too many
 
03:43:32.630 --> 03:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
examples you'll get the the kind of
 
03:43:32.640 --> 03:43:33.550 align:start position:0%
examples you'll get the the kind of
thing

03:43:33.550 --> 03:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:43:36.170 --> 03:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
we're talking about something what has
 
03:43:39.050 --> 03:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
nothing really do with misconduct
 
03:43:41.690 --> 03:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
just things that need to be regulated
 
03:43:44.450 --> 03:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
because of your doctor is always late
 
03:43:46.370 --> 03:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't do this doesn't do that doesn't
 
03:43:48.889 --> 03:43:48.899 align:start position:0%
get you a bill over charges whatever
 
03:43:51.309 --> 03:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
those are all things that need to be
 
03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
fixed or maybe the the practitioner has
 
03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
a problem with substance use or
 
03:44:02.570 --> 03:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
moral turpitude whatever these are all
 
03:44:05.330 --> 03:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
things that can't be can't be permitted
 
03:44:07.150 --> 03:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
or allowed to happen
 
03:44:11.210 --> 03:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
but it it's not appropriate to have
 
03:44:14.750 --> 03:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps the doctors uh sitting in
 
03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
judgment about something where they all
 
03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
know this doctor or this nurse or this
 
03:44:24.650 --> 03:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
whatever right they all they all know
 
03:44:26.570 --> 03:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
this person they don't want to come down
 
03:44:29.030 --> 03:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
too hard on them because maybe they've
 
03:44:31.130 --> 03:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
had an occasional transgression
 
03:44:34.250 --> 03:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
themselves or whatever but Justice must
 
03:44:35.809 --> 03:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
be done
 
03:44:38.030 --> 03:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we should I don't
 
03:44:40.130 --> 03:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
think we should prescribe all that I
 
03:44:41.990 --> 03:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
think that that's the kind of thing that
 
03:44:45.170 --> 03:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
that the boards should develop
 
03:44:47.269 --> 03:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
themselves and not necessarily
 
03:44:49.010 --> 03:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
Reinventing the wheel
 
03:44:51.710 --> 03:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
we live in a very large con company
 
03:44:55.010 --> 03:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
country with lots and lots and lots of
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
experience across the board on all this
 
03:45:00.950 --> 03:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
so we should not be devising all these
 
03:45:03.610 --> 03:45:03.620 align:start position:0%
things ourselves we should be cheerfully
 
03:45:06.950 --> 03:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
plagiarizing if you will uh how people
 
03:45:09.710 --> 03:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
in other states are doing it uh if
 
03:45:12.490 --> 03:45:12.500 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to reinvent the wheel
 
03:45:16.190 --> 03:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
and so I think that there I I think if
 
03:45:18.830 --> 03:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
we if we say that the the board is going
 
03:45:23.290 --> 03:45:23.300 align:start position:0%
to be in in charge of setting up rules
 
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh that we should let them do that and
 
03:45:29.929 --> 03:45:29.939 align:start position:0%
if the rules are unfair or whatever that
 
03:45:32.389 --> 03:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
either has to be worked out among the
 
03:45:32.399 --> 03:45:34.010 align:start position:0%
either has to be worked out among the
practitioners

03:45:34.010 --> 03:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
03:45:35.690 --> 03:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to be too strict
 
03:45:39.410 --> 03:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
about this or or whatever
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
um uh some things again because to the
 
03:45:44.750 --> 03:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
degree that we try to Define everything
 
03:45:47.870 --> 03:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
we're we're you know
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
I I think we're taking on a task that's
 
03:45:53.210 --> 03:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
not appropriate for the legislature to
 
03:45:55.610 --> 03:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
be involved in if crimes are involved
 
03:45:57.889 --> 03:45:57.899 align:start position:0%
then almost certainly the either the
 
03:46:00.349 --> 03:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
cops are going to get called in or the
 
03:46:02.030 --> 03:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
lawyers are going to get called in and
 
03:46:04.130 --> 03:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
this person is going to get sued
 
03:46:07.010 --> 03:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
or maybe the doctor since we're talking
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
about medicine here the doctor makes a
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
mistake and I'll give an example
 
03:46:15.650 --> 03:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
an acquaintance of mine many many years
 
03:46:15.660 --> 03:46:16.929 align:start position:0%
an acquaintance of mine many many years
ago

03:46:16.929 --> 03:46:16.939 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
told me that she had allowed the doctors
 
03:46:25.610 --> 03:46:25.620 align:start position:0%
to employ a an experimental technique on
 
03:46:27.950 --> 03:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
the birth of her son
 
03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
in the in the course of that delivery
 
03:46:34.370 --> 03:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
they cut off the oxygen too long to this
 
03:46:36.769 --> 03:46:36.779 align:start position:0%
child and he was permanently brain
 
03:46:39.830 --> 03:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
damaged okay this is not the kind of
 
03:46:42.830 --> 03:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
thing for him for a medical board to get
 
03:46:44.690 --> 03:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
involved in this is the kind of thing
 
03:46:46.849 --> 03:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
where the law has to get involved
 
03:46:48.889 --> 03:46:48.899 align:start position:0%
because you talked about the ten
 
03:46:51.010 --> 03:46:51.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar maximum fine
 
03:46:54.170 --> 03:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
I think that's I think to some degree
 
03:46:56.330 --> 03:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
that there's there should be either a
 
03:46:59.210 --> 03:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
much higher limit or no limit at all and
 
03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
to the degree that the board puts too
 
03:47:04.010 --> 03:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
high of a fine on something
 
03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
the the person can sue the board for
 
03:47:12.590 --> 03:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
making the wrong decision I I really
 
03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
don't think we should get into
 
03:47:17.330 --> 03:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
specifying everything because there's no
 
03:47:18.550 --> 03:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
end to it
 
03:47:21.889 --> 03:47:21.899 align:start position:0%
if I can respond Madam chairman um yeah
 
03:47:25.610 --> 03:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
please do that's why I ask you sir uh
 
03:47:29.469 --> 03:47:29.479 align:start position:0%
the standard of care is is understood by
 
03:47:32.650 --> 03:47:32.660 align:start position:0%
physicians they know some you know
 
03:47:35.150 --> 03:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
medicine isn't always safe sometimes you
 
03:47:37.729 --> 03:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
have to do something like chemicals that
 
03:47:39.530 --> 03:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
are really bad for the body but they
 
03:47:41.090 --> 03:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
kill the cancer and you've heard the
 
03:47:43.010 --> 03:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
expression you know it'll cure me if it
 
03:47:45.830 --> 03:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't kill me and so that question of
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
whether oxygen was deprived from the
 
03:47:50.450 --> 03:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
baby is one that medical providers know
 
03:47:52.670 --> 03:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
if this maneuver just to use your
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
example was appropriate to get a
 
03:47:56.349 --> 03:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
umbilical cord that was wrapped
 
03:47:58.969 --> 03:47:58.979 align:start position:0%
unwrapped that's not something that lay
 
03:48:01.250 --> 03:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
people should be deciding that's why the
 
03:48:03.050 --> 03:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
medical review subcommittee would decide
 
03:48:04.910 --> 03:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
no this is one of these unfortunate
 
03:48:07.309 --> 03:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
things that happen we recommend a board
 
03:48:09.530 --> 03:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
that this is not negligent or this is
 
03:48:11.450 --> 03:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
not Criminal
 
03:48:13.969 --> 03:48:13.979 align:start position:0%
and that's why it should stay with the
 
03:48:16.670 --> 03:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
people with the expertise the parallel
 
03:48:18.769 --> 03:48:18.779 align:start position:0%
it's been raised in a couple of these is
 
03:48:21.410 --> 03:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
that lawyers used to be you know a
 
03:48:23.269 --> 03:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
professional conduct committee
 
03:48:25.610 --> 03:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
and we needed to professionalize that
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
and it was moved to the Supreme Court
 
03:48:31.010 --> 03:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
now has funded an office of
 
03:48:33.769 --> 03:48:33.779 align:start position:0%
attorney discipline
 
03:48:36.170 --> 03:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
if you look at that office it's
 
03:48:38.510 --> 03:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys it's attorneys assessing the
 
03:48:40.370 --> 03:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
conduct and they also
 
03:48:42.410 --> 03:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
members of the bar in this state we know
 
03:48:44.870 --> 03:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
who we know them but it's attorneys that
 
03:48:46.490 --> 03:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
are deciding this was appropriate
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
conduct for an attorney or we're not
 
03:48:51.650 --> 03:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
sure we need to look into this or no
 
03:48:54.410 --> 03:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
this is this is a bad outcome or it
 
03:48:57.229 --> 03:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
appears unfortunate but we as attorneys
 
03:48:59.929 --> 03:48:59.939 align:start position:0%
know that so that that parallel would
 
03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
suggest staying with a medical review
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and with the board for
 
03:49:04.080 --> 03:49:05.210 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and with the board for
initiating

03:49:05.210 --> 03:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
initiating
 
03:49:08.030 --> 03:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
a case so my big concern is that we're
 
03:49:10.550 --> 03:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
moving the ability to initiate and
 
03:49:10.560 --> 03:49:11.870 align:start position:0%
moving the ability to initiate and
investigate

03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
03:49:11.880 --> 03:49:13.670 align:start position:0%
investigate
with

03:49:13.670 --> 03:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
seems to me unfettered subpoena power
 
03:49:19.250 --> 03:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
and all of the challenges and and
 
03:49:21.110 --> 03:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
concerns that a defendant is going to
 
03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
have in an investigation to lay people
 
03:49:26.809 --> 03:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
and away from the medical people that
 
03:49:28.190 --> 03:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
has historically been with the
 
03:49:31.130 --> 03:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
legislature requested
 
03:49:33.710 --> 03:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
I believe representative Dolan has a
 
03:49:33.720 --> 03:49:35.030 align:start position:0%
I believe representative Dolan has a
question

03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:49:37.010 --> 03:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my question is
 
03:49:41.450 --> 03:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
with the the oplc folks here I wonder
 
03:49:43.910 --> 03:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
if we could switch back to them so I
 
03:49:46.190 --> 03:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
think let me just so that's fine and I
 
03:49:49.070 --> 03:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
think let me I'm so sorry in the house
 
03:49:52.130 --> 03:49:52.140 align:start position:0%
bill 655 in the medical review board was
 
03:49:53.870 --> 03:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
merged with the Board of Medicine and
 
03:49:55.729 --> 03:49:55.739 align:start position:0%
basically looked like it was eliminated
 
03:49:58.309 --> 03:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
so it's and and I think that's something
 
03:50:00.229 --> 03:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
that wasn't one of the reasons why we're
 
03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
having this discussion because we don't
 
03:50:04.309 --> 03:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that's is that your
 
03:50:04.319 --> 03:50:06.170 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that's is that your
concern

03:50:06.170 --> 03:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:50:08.929 --> 03:50:08.939 align:start position:0%
both that it remains and that it's not a
 
03:50:11.990 --> 03:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
Vestige oh we didn't disband it but the
 
03:50:13.790 --> 03:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
process as described to you before we
 
03:50:16.309 --> 03:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
only discussed when the oplc decides to
 
03:50:18.710 --> 03:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
dismiss a case board could still decide
 
03:50:21.710 --> 03:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
to proceed but we didn't talk about when
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
the oplc undertook an investigation that
 
03:50:26.570 --> 03:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
medical people would have said that
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's that's part of medicine okay so
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
we need the medical review subcommunity
 
03:50:31.729 --> 03:50:31.739 align:start position:0%
to remain
 
03:50:34.429 --> 03:50:34.439 align:start position:0%
and to be part of that screening process
 
03:50:36.530 --> 03:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
and that early analysis okay I
 
03:50:38.150 --> 03:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
understand that's the big that's my
 
03:50:40.070 --> 03:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
biggest concern okay great do we have
 
03:50:41.929 --> 03:50:41.939 align:start position:0%
someone from oplc who wants to make a
 
03:50:44.450 --> 03:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
comment I do want to also say I'm sorry
 
03:50:48.170 --> 03:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
you can I I did let I did
 
03:50:50.990 --> 03:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
um tell Mr dejoy that he could have a
 
03:50:52.610 --> 03:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
few minutes to talk about this social
 
03:50:54.349 --> 03:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
did you want to still talk about that or
 
03:50:58.910 --> 03:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
no yes so this so representative Dolan
 
03:51:01.010 --> 03:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to know if someone from oplc
 
03:51:03.469 --> 03:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
wants to make a comment on the on this
 
03:51:03.479 --> 03:51:05.330 align:start position:0%
wants to make a comment on the on this
situation

03:51:05.330 --> 03:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:51:05.340 --> 03:51:07.250 align:start position:0%
situation
oh

03:51:07.250 --> 03:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:51:09.170 --> 03:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
okay representative Lucas will have a
 
03:51:11.090 --> 03:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
question to you so
 
03:51:14.690 --> 03:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
um thank you ma'am my uh
 
03:51:16.490 --> 03:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
well I think I'm gonna try to take us
 
03:51:18.530 --> 03:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
back out of the weeds and do it at the
 
03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
50 000 foot level
 
03:51:20.760 --> 03:51:22.429 align:start position:0%
50 000 foot level
um

03:51:22.429 --> 03:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:26.030 --> 03:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
my interest is going back to the
 
03:51:26.040 --> 03:51:27.170 align:start position:0%
my interest is going back to the
amendment

03:51:27.170 --> 03:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:51:30.710 --> 03:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about and with the
 
03:51:33.110 --> 03:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
thought that the activities that you
 
03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
guys take with respond to in response to
 
03:51:38.030 --> 03:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
a complaint
 
03:51:38.040 --> 03:51:39.550 align:start position:0%
a complaint
uh

03:51:39.550 --> 03:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:43.250 --> 03:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
that eventually this is all supposed to
 
03:51:45.830 --> 03:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
protect the consumer or the or our
 
03:51:50.269 --> 03:51:50.279 align:start position:0%
constituents so it so my question is
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
with what is before us and before you
 
03:51:55.969 --> 03:51:55.979 align:start position:0%
with this amendment is there anything in
 
03:51:59.090 --> 03:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
that language that
 
03:52:03.170 --> 03:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
is bad for or hurts the ability of
 
03:52:05.929 --> 03:52:05.939 align:start position:0%
constituents of our constituents or our
 
03:52:08.330 --> 03:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
citizens at Large
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
to have their complaints uh heard and
 
03:52:14.510 --> 03:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
addressed appropriately is it does this
 
03:52:20.090 --> 03:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
by the amendment you're referring to
 
03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
the 655 has passed by the house
 
03:52:29.330 --> 03:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
I would say no I think if anything it's
 
03:52:32.030 --> 03:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
going to speed up the process and
 
03:52:32.040 --> 03:52:33.250 align:start position:0%
going to speed up the process and
um

03:52:33.250 --> 03:52:33.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
bring resolution to matters both to the
 
03:52:38.450 --> 03:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
benefit of the complaining and the
 
03:52:38.460 --> 03:52:40.309 align:start position:0%
benefit of the complaining and the
licensee

03:52:40.309 --> 03:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
licensee
 
03:52:43.849 --> 03:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
but I I don't see the harm to any
 
03:52:46.849 --> 03:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
constituents in doing this answer that's
 
03:52:48.050 --> 03:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
my my
 
03:52:50.750 --> 03:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
hope that that the matter we're taking
 
03:52:54.790 --> 03:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
up takes us it causes no harm
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify
 
03:53:01.309 --> 03:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
when we go to House Bill 655 it was a
 
03:53:04.490 --> 03:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
huge bill right so what we decided to do
 
03:53:06.590 --> 03:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
was and because it was so huge and there
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
were so many issues that we couldn't
 
03:53:10.190 --> 03:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
really handle within the time frame that
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
we had we chose to take a tiny piece of
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
it and clarify that
 
03:53:18.769 --> 03:53:18.779 align:start position:0%
so what that does is it gives oplc
 
03:53:21.889 --> 03:53:21.899 align:start position:0%
um authority to issue licenses and redo
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
and it ties in hand in hand with their
 
03:53:30.290 --> 03:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
process to go online so now we have we
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
have not impeded that right that's as
 
03:53:36.229 --> 03:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
far as house bills the amendment what
 
03:53:38.090 --> 03:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
we're talking about now is all the
 
03:53:40.610 --> 03:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
leftover stuff that we didn't talk about
 
03:53:43.130 --> 03:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
and it's a little messy because it's a
 
03:53:44.330 --> 03:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
little bit of here and there and
 
03:53:44.340 --> 03:53:45.290 align:start position:0%
little bit of here and there and
everywhere

03:53:45.290 --> 03:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
all at once so you know we can certainly
 
03:53:48.840 --> 03:53:49.490 align:start position:0%
all at once so you know we can certainly
um

03:53:49.490 --> 03:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:52.969 --> 03:53:52.979 align:start position:0%
address it as we see fit so do you want
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
to talk did you have a question
 
03:53:54.239 --> 03:53:55.910 align:start position:0%
to talk did you have a question
representative

03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:53:59.150 --> 03:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
I promise you we will not do any harm
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous promise but I actually have a
 
03:54:06.050 --> 03:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
somewhat specific question and that is
 
03:54:06.060 --> 03:54:07.070 align:start position:0%
somewhat specific question and that is
uh

03:54:07.070 --> 03:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:54:09.769 --> 03:54:09.779 align:start position:0%
as I recall
 
03:54:13.190 --> 03:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
um the cost of the investigation can be
 
03:54:14.929 --> 03:54:14.939 align:start position:0%
charged the person the complaint was
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
brought against
 
03:54:18.830 --> 03:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
at least under some circumstances is
 
03:54:20.990 --> 03:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
03:54:23.030 --> 03:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and what are those circumstances and
 
03:54:25.550 --> 03:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
is there any limit to how much they
 
03:54:27.229 --> 03:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
could end up be
 
03:54:32.510 --> 03:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:32.520 --> 03:54:33.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:54:33.349 --> 03:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:35.389 --> 03:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
so I believe the circumstances have to
 
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
be that it was adjudicated and that
 
03:54:40.309 --> 03:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
discipline was imposed it would have to
 
03:54:43.849 --> 03:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
be found that they did violate the
 
03:54:45.710 --> 03:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
statutory rule
 
03:54:49.010 --> 03:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and that discipline was imposed
 
03:54:51.170 --> 03:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there's a specific
 
03:54:51.180 --> 03:54:53.689 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there's a specific
limit

03:54:53.689 --> 03:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
limit
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
um within the amendment um other it has
 
03:54:58.610 --> 03:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
to be reasonable I think we'd have to be
 
03:55:00.769 --> 03:55:00.779 align:start position:0%
able to justify the amount we couldn't
 
03:55:02.990 --> 03:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
just come up with a number
 
03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:03.830 align:start position:0%
just come up with a number
um

03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:08.630 --> 03:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.640 --> 03:55:11.570 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:55:11.570 --> 03:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:14.570 --> 03:55:14.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at section 310 12
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
proposed page 15.
 
03:55:21.710 --> 03:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
in hb655 is amended by the house
 
03:55:21.720 --> 03:55:24.610 align:start position:0%
in hb655 is amended by the house
um

03:55:24.610 --> 03:55:24.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:28.250 --> 03:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
it's the section on sanctions and if you
 
03:55:30.710 --> 03:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
look down at line 26 by assessing an
 
03:55:32.030 --> 03:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
administrative fines and amounts
 
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
established by the board
 
03:55:35.630 --> 03:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
which shall not exceed three thousand
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
dollars per offense or in the case of
 
03:55:39.950 --> 03:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
continuing that's the fine you're
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
talking about right and what page was
 
03:55:44.269 --> 03:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
that again
 
03:55:48.050 --> 03:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what page was that again 15.
 
03:55:49.969 --> 03:55:49.979 align:start position:0%
um I do remember seeing I think in the
 
03:55:52.189 --> 03:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
case of unlicensed practice there was a
 
03:55:56.510 --> 03:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:59.990 --> 03:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
no go ahead that was so rude uh section
 
03:56:03.710 --> 03:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
310 13 on page 16 beginning at line 17.
 
03:56:06.170 --> 03:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
uh if you go down to line 22 after
 
03:56:08.090 --> 03:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
providing notice and opportunity to be
 
03:56:10.490 --> 03:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
heard and upon making an affirmative
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
finding of unlawful practice the board
 
03:56:16.130 --> 03:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
May impose a fine not to exceed the
 
03:56:18.830 --> 03:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
amount of any gain or economic benefit
 
03:56:20.630 --> 03:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
that the person derived from the
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
violation or up to ten thousand dollars
 
03:56:25.550 --> 03:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
for each offense whichever amount is
 
03:56:28.250 --> 03:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
greater but that's the fine
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like
 
03:56:32.269 --> 03:56:32.279 align:start position:0%
what you're asking specifically for
 
03:56:34.490 --> 03:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
they're being charged to pay for the
 
03:56:36.590 --> 03:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
investigation yeah
 
03:56:38.750 --> 03:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
that was only if they're
 
03:56:41.030 --> 03:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
bound to be
 
03:56:43.790 --> 03:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
um in violation yeah if they're not
 
03:56:45.290 --> 03:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
found in violation they don't pay them
 
03:56:47.389 --> 03:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
well the next question then is what if
 
03:56:48.830 --> 03:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
there's a settlement does that count
 
03:56:50.750 --> 03:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
because there can people can end up
 
03:56:52.729 --> 03:56:52.739 align:start position:0%
settling things even if they don't I
 
03:56:55.250 --> 03:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
believe that in the con in in the
 
03:56:58.250 --> 03:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
comments that Mr dejoy made the fine
 
03:57:00.769 --> 03:57:00.779 align:start position:0%
there was no there was no way of
 
03:57:00.779 --> 03:57:02.210 align:start position:0%
there was no there was no way of
recouping

03:57:02.210 --> 03:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
recouping
 
03:57:09.889 --> 03:57:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:12.170 --> 03:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
I don't think that is I don't think that
 
03:57:13.969 --> 03:57:13.979 align:start position:0%
for some reason I'm not remembering that
 
03:57:16.130 --> 03:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
in this house in the amendment to House
 
03:57:18.290 --> 03:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
Bill six right I when I read through it
 
03:57:19.969 --> 03:57:19.979 align:start position:0%
earlier today I think it said a
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount I don't I I could be
 
03:57:24.530 --> 03:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
mistaken but I don't remember seeing a
 
03:57:26.570 --> 03:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
specific amount in the amended in the
 
03:57:31.969 --> 03:57:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:34.550 --> 03:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
I mean yeah I mean the thing I'm
 
03:57:36.769 --> 03:57:36.779 align:start position:0%
thinking about is you know not accusing
 
03:57:38.210 --> 03:57:38.220 align:start position:0%
about PLC planning to do something
 
03:57:39.889 --> 03:57:39.899 align:start position:0%
horrible but
 
03:57:42.110 --> 03:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
um you know you could end up hiring a
 
03:57:44.210 --> 03:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
few top experts across the country fly
 
03:57:46.610 --> 03:57:46.620 align:start position:0%
them in put them up and you know pay
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
them you know umpteen thousand dollars a
 
03:57:51.710 --> 03:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
day to do the investigation and you know
 
03:57:52.910 --> 03:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
you can argue whether or not that's
 
03:57:56.210 --> 03:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
reasonable but to then take somebody's
 
03:57:58.070 --> 03:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
been accused of something and even if
 
03:58:01.189 --> 03:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
there was some wrongdoing or maybe and
 
03:58:02.990 --> 03:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
it also might be a deterrent to them
 
03:58:04.910 --> 03:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
settling because you know if the
 
03:58:07.490 --> 03:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
potential cost is enormous if they're
 
03:58:11.750 --> 03:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:13.969 --> 03:58:13.979 align:start position:0%
I did find the languages on page 16
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
section five uh line nine for any order
 
03:58:19.130 --> 03:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
issued in resolution of a disciplinary
 
03:58:20.929 --> 03:58:20.939 align:start position:0%
proceeding by the board
 
03:58:22.610 --> 03:58:22.620 align:start position:0%
which would include settlement
 
03:58:24.349 --> 03:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
agreements where the board has found
 
03:58:25.969 --> 03:58:25.979 align:start position:0%
misconduct sufficient to support
 
03:58:27.769 --> 03:58:27.779 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action the board may
 
03:58:29.809 --> 03:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
require the licensee or certificate
 
03:58:31.910 --> 03:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
holder who is the subject of such
 
03:58:35.090 --> 03:58:35.100 align:start position:0%
finding to pay the office a sum not to
 
03:58:36.769 --> 03:58:36.779 align:start position:0%
exceed the reasonable cost of
 
03:58:38.990 --> 03:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
investigation and Prosecuting of the
 
03:58:40.130 --> 03:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
proceeding I'm just pointing out the
 
03:58:40.140 --> 03:58:41.590 align:start position:0%
proceeding I'm just pointing out the
language

03:58:41.590 --> 03:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:58:44.150 --> 03:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
I don't believe oplc made any
 
03:58:45.769 --> 03:58:45.779 align:start position:0%
recommendations on this language so
 
03:58:47.330 --> 03:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
everything in here was either existing
 
03:58:49.070 --> 03:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
statute or at the recommendation of the
 
03:58:49.080 --> 03:58:50.389 align:start position:0%
statute or at the recommendation of the
legislature

03:58:50.389 --> 03:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:58:52.729 --> 03:58:52.739 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:58:55.130 --> 03:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
still have some concern on that but all
 
03:58:58.490 --> 03:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
right thanks that's also why why met
 
03:59:00.769 --> 03:59:00.779 align:start position:0%
doctors have malpractice insurance for
 
03:59:03.710 --> 03:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
example we had a situation
 
03:59:08.570 --> 03:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
roughly 10 years ago with ob gyns I
 
03:59:10.610 --> 03:59:10.620 align:start position:0%
think in general malpractice doesn't pay
 
03:59:13.189 --> 03:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
for fines and charges for things like
 
03:59:14.929 --> 03:59:14.939 align:start position:0%
this so
 
03:59:17.330 --> 03:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna stop this discussion and
 
03:59:20.090 --> 03:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give Dr I mean John dejoy
 
03:59:22.189 --> 03:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
the opportunity doctor to Joy now you've
 
03:59:26.030 --> 03:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
been promoted to um to speak on your
 
03:59:29.330 --> 03:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
issue and then we're going to
 
03:59:34.130 --> 03:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
and that and start the two o'clock
 
03:59:36.650 --> 03:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
subcommittee workshop on
 
03:59:44.229 --> 03:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Lynn Stanley I'm
 
03:59:48.170 --> 03:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the National
 
03:59:49.910 --> 03:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
Association of Social Workers New
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chapter I'm also a licensed
 
03:59:54.410 --> 03:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
independent clinical social worker and I
 
03:59:56.450 --> 03:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
live in Penacook and thank you
 
03:59:58.250 --> 03:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative Grove for allowing us to
 
04:00:01.309 --> 04:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
insert ourselves uh to very briefly
 
04:00:03.650 --> 04:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
again talk about the social work compact
 
04:00:05.870 --> 04:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
the language came out the end of
 
04:00:07.130 --> 04:00:07.140 align:start position:0%
February which is why it wasn't
 
04:00:10.610 --> 04:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
introduced uh during normal times when
 
04:00:13.490 --> 04:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
bills are introduced the social work
 
04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
compact would allow any licensed if
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
passed in New Hampshire would allow any
 
04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
licensed independent clinical social
 
04:00:23.750 --> 04:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
worker in New Hampshire to also practice
 
04:00:26.510 --> 04:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
and see clients in the other states that
 
04:00:30.830 --> 04:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
have accepted and approved the compact
 
04:00:32.510 --> 04:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
I want to highlight some of the reasons
 
04:00:34.910 --> 04:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
why this is important to our social
 
04:00:37.610 --> 04:00:37.620 align:start position:0%
workers if you think about social
 
04:00:40.309 --> 04:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
workers who are even either in private
 
04:00:42.530 --> 04:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
or small group practice they're small
 
04:00:44.030 --> 04:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
businesses right they have their
 
04:00:46.070 --> 04:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
expenses that they need to take on or
 
04:00:48.889 --> 04:00:48.899 align:start position:0%
they're working in an agency which is
 
04:00:51.889 --> 04:00:51.899 align:start position:0%
often a mental health agency a service
 
04:00:54.830 --> 04:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
providing agency which also has a
 
04:00:54.840 --> 04:00:57.849 align:start position:0%
providing agency which also has a
significant

04:00:57.849 --> 04:00:57.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:01.910 --> 04:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh Financial challenges what this would
 
04:01:05.210 --> 04:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
do would reduce the expenses for that
 
04:01:07.610 --> 04:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
social worker to hold their license if
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
they had the interstate
 
04:01:12.290 --> 04:01:12.300 align:start position:0%
license your social workers right now
 
04:01:15.050 --> 04:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
who are licensed in New Hampshire Maine
 
04:01:17.330 --> 04:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts or
 
04:01:19.870 --> 04:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Vermont and Massachusetts
 
04:01:22.969 --> 04:01:22.979 align:start position:0%
would only have to maintain their New
 
04:01:25.790 --> 04:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license and responsibilities
 
04:01:25.800 --> 04:01:27.429 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license and responsibilities
around

04:01:27.429 --> 04:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:01:31.849 --> 04:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
professional development licensing fees
 
04:01:31.859 --> 04:01:32.689 align:start position:0%
professional development licensing fees
Etc

04:01:32.689 --> 04:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
04:01:32.699 --> 04:01:35.870 align:start position:0%
Etc
uh

04:01:35.870 --> 04:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
when considering Workforce
 
04:01:40.610 --> 04:01:40.620 align:start position:0%
I think it was said the last time we
 
04:01:43.150 --> 04:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
talked it's not going to expand
 
04:01:46.550 --> 04:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
significantly expand our Workforce what
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
it will do is when social workers for
 
04:01:52.689 --> 04:01:52.699 align:start position:0%
from another state move to New Hampshire
 
04:01:56.030 --> 04:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
and right now South Carolina and North
 
04:01:58.330 --> 04:01:58.340 align:start position:0%
Carolina are breaking their necks to get
 
04:02:02.689 --> 04:02:02.699 align:start position:0%
get the compact uh enacted first if one
 
04:02:04.370 --> 04:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
of those social workers was to move up
 
04:02:07.010 --> 04:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire they wouldn't have to
 
04:02:10.130 --> 04:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
wait months in order to get licensed
 
04:02:13.130 --> 04:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
here their license would be good while
 
04:02:15.050 --> 04:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
they established their their home
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
license it also provides continuity of
 
04:02:21.769 --> 04:02:21.779 align:start position:0%
care if a social worker has a client in
 
04:02:24.349 --> 04:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that goes on vacation goes
 
04:02:26.750 --> 04:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
to college finds themselves in another
 
04:02:29.389 --> 04:02:29.399 align:start position:0%
state that social worker would be able
 
04:02:32.689 --> 04:02:32.699 align:start position:0%
to continue seeing their client
 
04:02:35.330 --> 04:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
rather than because right now they'd be
 
04:02:36.889 --> 04:02:36.899 align:start position:0%
breaking the law if they are not
 
04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
licensed in whatever state their their
 
04:02:42.050 --> 04:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
client is I'm happy to answer any
 
04:02:43.490 --> 04:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
questions but thank you for the
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
so I think I made some recommendations
 
04:02:57.530 --> 04:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
to Mr dejoy that it would be helpful for
 
04:02:58.729 --> 04:02:58.739 align:start position:0%
us to know
 
04:03:01.070 --> 04:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
the successes of the previous compacts
 
04:03:02.750 --> 04:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
that we've entered
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
and he I believe that you're working on
 
04:03:06.830 --> 04:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
04:03:08.950 --> 04:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct I'm working with director
 
04:03:11.090 --> 04:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
Courtney on that she gave me some
 
04:03:13.550 --> 04:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
preliminary information this morning so
 
04:03:15.410 --> 04:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
Rel there are a number of compacts where
 
04:03:17.330 --> 04:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
that the state is involved in currently
 
04:03:19.090 --> 04:03:19.100 align:start position:0%
one of them is the nursing compact
 
04:03:21.769 --> 04:03:21.779 align:start position:0%
relative to a registered nurse
 
04:03:24.349 --> 04:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
practitioners since the compact New
 
04:03:27.710 --> 04:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has seen an increase of 25 of
 
04:03:29.450 --> 04:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
availability of nurse practitioners in
 
04:03:31.370 --> 04:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
the state to practice that's a
 
04:03:33.710 --> 04:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
significant number I'm trying to find
 
04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
similar data with director Courtney's
 
04:03:38.290 --> 04:03:38.300 align:start position:0%

04:04:20.210 --> 04:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
amendment to HP 65 by and large the
 
04:04:24.070 --> 04:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine is supportive of 655.
 
04:04:26.929 --> 04:04:26.939 align:start position:0%
their concerns were specifically related
 
04:04:30.410 --> 04:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
to complaints and investigations and the
 
04:04:32.929 --> 04:04:32.939 align:start position:0%
amendment Alters that so I have copies
 
04:04:37.010 --> 04:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:37.020 --> 04:04:39.050 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:04:39.050 --> 04:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is a tissue with physical
 
04:04:49.570 --> 04:04:49.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:54.349 --> 04:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
okay because there was also a concern
 
04:04:56.929 --> 04:04:56.939 align:start position:0%
with telemedicine am I correct with
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
physical regarding physician assistance
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
they were not included in the television
 
04:05:03.170 --> 04:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
right yeah but this is separate to that
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay separate from that okay
 
04:05:08.210 --> 04:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
and I know that there was a a brief
 
04:05:08.220 --> 04:05:09.530 align:start position:0%
and I know that there was a a brief
discussion

04:05:09.530 --> 04:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:05:12.110 --> 04:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
um and some testimony earlier regarding
 
04:05:15.590 --> 04:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
um uh the office's ability to vet and
 
04:05:18.889 --> 04:05:18.899 align:start position:0%
utilize professional expertise of
 
04:05:20.330 --> 04:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
individuals separate and distinct from
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
the board the board is very supportive
 
04:05:25.010 --> 04:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
of you know knowing their role and
 
04:05:26.990 --> 04:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
utilizing their role as the jury and
 
04:05:29.389 --> 04:05:29.399 align:start position:0%
likes to stay completely separate from
 
04:05:31.429 --> 04:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
the complaint process and procedure to
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
the best of their ability within the
 
04:05:35.929 --> 04:05:35.939 align:start position:0%
confines of what's proposed with that
 
04:05:38.510 --> 04:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
being said they they're hoping it has
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
been discussed with the office that they
 
04:05:44.150 --> 04:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
want some sort of peer review in place
 
04:05:47.030 --> 04:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
that utilizes the expertise within the
 
04:05:49.250 --> 04:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
medical profession to vet some of these
 
04:05:51.950 --> 04:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
and the board has worked well with the
 
04:05:54.170 --> 04:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
office in regards to that specifically
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
with the enforcement department
 
04:05:58.130 --> 04:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
okay and you're talking about the Board
 
04:06:00.349 --> 04:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
of Medicine correct and this would be
 
04:06:02.570 --> 04:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
like a peer review board
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
um you um that's what they would like to
 
04:06:07.550 --> 04:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
see utilized um is some you know the
 
04:06:09.410 --> 04:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
office under the proposal will have the
 
04:06:11.030 --> 04:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
authority to control contract with
 
04:06:13.849 --> 04:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
necessary experts so some form of peer
 
04:06:16.370 --> 04:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
review right now uh they have physician
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
investigator board investigator actually
 
04:06:20.090 --> 04:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
I believe two physician investigators
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
and then there's the mrsc at some point
 
04:06:25.490 --> 04:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
they just want some you know expertise
 
04:06:28.010 --> 04:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
and 655 would give the office the
 
04:06:29.929 --> 04:06:29.939 align:start position:0%
authority to contract with whatever
 
04:06:32.750 --> 04:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
necessary experts would you know be
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate to vet these okay and I okay
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you does anybody have any
 
04:06:38.330 --> 04:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
questions about this
 
04:06:42.650 --> 04:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
no all right oh yes I'm so sorry
 
04:06:47.090 --> 04:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
so since 655 is out of our hands now we
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
will have to
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
tackle this
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
amendment in a different fashion I
 
04:06:54.650 --> 04:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
believe is that not the correct that's
 
04:06:57.769 --> 04:06:57.779 align:start position:0%
correct so after all these this these
 
04:07:00.950 --> 04:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee workshops I'll call them
 
04:07:02.570 --> 04:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
we're going to put together a
 
04:07:04.969 --> 04:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
non-germaine amendment in the fall and
 
04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
attach it to a bill that were retained
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
in committee
 
04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
right so there's at this point
 
04:07:12.290 --> 04:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
everything is still
 
04:07:13.969 --> 04:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
for discussion
 
04:07:16.070 --> 04:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
understand thank you and we do I have
 
04:07:18.349 --> 04:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
not forgotten that we will add
 
04:07:20.150 --> 04:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
we will discuss adding physician
 
04:07:23.269 --> 04:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
assistance to the television right thank
 
04:07:23.279 --> 04:07:25.250 align:start position:0%

04:07:32.450 --> 04:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
going to discuss that next week so
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
there's lots of little snipply bits that
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
we have to talk about
 
04:07:39.710 --> 04:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much so this ends the
 
04:07:42.170 --> 04:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
discussion and we're going to move to
 
04:07:46.010 --> 04:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 44 which is the m ladak
 
04:07:53.570 --> 04:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:55.070 --> 04:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a three-minute
 
04:09:34.490 --> 04:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:34.500 --> 04:15:27.110 align:start position:0%

good afternoon everybody and thank you

for uh inviting us to speak my name is
 
04:17:53.389 --> 04:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
Jackie avocoff I am uh the former chair
 
04:17:58.490 --> 04:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
of the late act board uh and uh I'm an m
 
04:18:01.070 --> 04:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
ladak and also a licensed clinical
 
04:18:04.610 --> 04:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
social worker and and I'm Kelly ledke I
 
04:18:07.729 --> 04:18:07.739 align:start position:0%
am an M ladak I am the current board
 
04:18:11.030 --> 04:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:16.269 --> 04:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
so just to give you an overview of
 
04:18:20.269 --> 04:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
sb44 as it stands before you today it
 
04:18:23.750 --> 04:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
really looks at doing two things the
 
04:18:27.950 --> 04:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
simple one is it changes some language
 
04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
um taking out a criminal the criminal
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
justice requirement the criminal justice
 
04:18:37.929 --> 04:18:37.939 align:start position:0%
degree as a um
 
04:18:40.849 --> 04:18:40.859 align:start position:0%
as one of the degrees that automatically
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
gets licensed and that's because uh the
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
core the course of study at snhu that
 
04:18:53.809 --> 04:18:53.819 align:start position:0%
that inspired that language in 2008 no
 
04:18:56.809 --> 04:18:56.819 align:start position:0%
longer exists and it was it's the only
 
04:18:59.809 --> 04:18:59.819 align:start position:0%
one that we know of at least locally so
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh it what it does is it moves the uh
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice degree into rule
 
04:19:08.510 --> 04:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
instead of statute
 
04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh the more important piece right now is
 
04:19:15.050 --> 04:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
it looks to further expand the scope of
 
04:19:17.570 --> 04:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
practice for master licensed alcohol and
 
04:19:21.469 --> 04:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
drug counselors so that they are no
 
04:19:24.349 --> 04:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
longer restricted from engaging in
 
04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
mental health practice solely while
 
04:19:30.110 --> 04:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
working with someone who is actively
 
04:19:33.530 --> 04:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
working on a substance use disorder
 
04:19:38.570 --> 04:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
and the logic behind this in 2010 the M
 
04:19:42.769 --> 04:19:42.779 align:start position:0%
laidak scope of practice was expanded to
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
include the treatment of mental health
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the ability to work with someone who
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
understands their addiction which often
 
04:19:53.809 --> 04:19:53.819 align:start position:0%
is a primary illness what what research
 
04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
has told us is that addiction is a brain
 
04:20:01.550 --> 04:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
disease and that it often mimics mental
 
04:20:04.910 --> 04:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
illness and often causes mental illness
 
04:20:07.250 --> 04:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
and needs a special kind of treatment
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
that integrates both substance use and
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
mental health what we have learned since
 
04:20:13.199 --> 04:20:14.750 align:start position:0%
mental health what we have learned since
2010

04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
2010
 
04:20:17.389 --> 04:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
is that the way the language was written
 
04:20:20.330 --> 04:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
it says that the M laidak who has to
 
04:20:22.849 --> 04:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
have exactly the same educational
 
04:20:26.030 --> 04:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
preparation as a social worker or a
 
04:20:28.929 --> 04:20:28.939 align:start position:0%
mental health counselor
 
04:20:33.170 --> 04:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that 300 hours of
 
04:20:35.450 --> 04:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
co-occurring disorder and substance use
 
04:20:38.090 --> 04:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
disorder education
 
04:20:41.330 --> 04:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
um that person could only treat some
 
04:20:43.610 --> 04:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
people with substance use disorder who
 
04:20:45.650 --> 04:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
also have mental illness could also only
 
04:20:48.349 --> 04:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
treat the mental illness while they are
 
04:20:50.689 --> 04:20:50.699 align:start position:0%
engaged in treatment of their substance
 
04:20:53.570 --> 04:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
use disorder what we've learned is
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
people engage in treatment of their
 
04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder they get
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
connected with a recovery Community they
 
04:21:01.790 --> 04:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
get connected with other uh with other
 
04:21:04.370 --> 04:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
supports their substance use disorder
 
04:21:06.290 --> 04:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
goes into remission it may take two or
 
04:21:08.570 --> 04:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
three years they've established a really
 
04:21:11.510 --> 04:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
strong relationship with their therapist
 
04:21:14.450 --> 04:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
but once the substance use disorder is
 
04:21:17.570 --> 04:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
not an active focus of treatment because
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's in remission that therapist can no
 
04:21:24.590 --> 04:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
longer treat the mental illness
 
04:21:27.229 --> 04:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
because it's only while in treatment for
 
04:21:29.809 --> 04:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
the substance use disorder that what
 
04:21:32.750 --> 04:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
we've learned is that interrupts a
 
04:21:34.969 --> 04:21:34.979 align:start position:0%
strong relationship between a therapist
 
04:21:38.090 --> 04:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
and a client it forces that person to
 
04:21:40.490 --> 04:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
begin from the beginning with a brand
 
04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
new person and it often leads to relapse
 
04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
with the substance use disorder because
 
04:21:50.090 --> 04:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
folks don't move on and start with
 
04:21:51.229 --> 04:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
someone else
 
04:21:54.050 --> 04:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
so that is the primary purpose
 
04:21:58.250 --> 04:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder providers have a
 
04:22:01.490 --> 04:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
focus on substance use disorder and they
 
04:22:03.229 --> 04:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
treat the mental illness within the
 
04:22:05.570 --> 04:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
context of that substance use disorder
 
04:22:08.150 --> 04:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's active or not active
 
04:22:10.250 --> 04:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh it's very different than a mental
 
04:22:12.349 --> 04:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
health professional whose focus is
 
04:22:15.170 --> 04:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
mental health and treats substance some
 
04:22:17.870 --> 04:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
of them treat substance use disorder as
 
04:22:20.929 --> 04:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
a as a specialty some of them have no
 
04:22:23.389 --> 04:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
training whatsoever in substance use
 
04:22:26.929 --> 04:22:26.939 align:start position:0%
disorder when I got my license as a
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
social worker
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
I had zero courses in the treatment of
 
04:22:33.769 --> 04:22:33.779 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder that was
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
something that I had to learn when I got
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
my 300 hours of specialized training and
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
education I'm sorry education in
 
04:22:44.510 --> 04:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
substance use and co-occurring disorders
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose what we believe is
 
04:22:49.670 --> 04:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
that what this will do is support
 
04:22:53.630 --> 04:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
continuity of care and expand access to
 
04:22:56.750 --> 04:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate treatment providers for the
 
04:22:58.849 --> 04:22:58.859 align:start position:0%
population that we Target and that is
 
04:23:01.070 --> 04:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
folks with substance use disorder and
 
04:23:02.750 --> 04:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
co-occurring mental health disorders
 
04:23:06.229 --> 04:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you want to add anything does
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions on this yes
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes for pretty damn Schmidt
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again Jackie
 
04:23:17.689 --> 04:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Kelly but I've known Jackie
 
04:23:19.010 --> 04:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
for years
 
04:23:22.130 --> 04:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
um so the thing is that
 
04:23:22.140 --> 04:23:23.570 align:start position:0%
um so the thing is that
um

04:23:23.570 --> 04:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:23.580 --> 04:23:26.090 align:start position:0%
um
I've

04:23:26.090 --> 04:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
I've
 
04:23:28.130 --> 04:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
lived a long life and even though I
 
04:23:30.830 --> 04:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't happen to have substance use
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
addictions at least other than chocolate
 
04:23:37.370 --> 04:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
um the the uh the the reality is that
 
04:23:39.370 --> 04:23:39.380 align:start position:0%
many people are
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
they are sober for a while
 
04:23:44.689 --> 04:23:44.699 align:start position:0%
then they fall off the wagon for
 
04:23:49.550 --> 04:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
whatever reason uh so
 
04:23:51.950 --> 04:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's a very delicate
 
04:23:53.809 --> 04:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
balance that this current situation
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
imposes on you that you can only do this
 
04:23:59.950 --> 04:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
unless it's Tuesday effectively you know
 
04:24:03.490 --> 04:24:03.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes Sundays uh but but
 
04:24:06.650 --> 04:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
does that really make any sense to have
 
04:24:08.990 --> 04:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
that firewall between the two
 
04:24:12.410 --> 04:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
absolutely not and in fact what it does
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
is it contributes to relapse because
 
04:24:17.090 --> 04:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
those people who really need to continue
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
to be in some kind of counseling have to
 
04:24:22.490 --> 04:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
start from the beginning all over with a
 
04:24:25.849 --> 04:24:25.859 align:start position:0%
new person either that or so I'm the
 
04:24:27.969 --> 04:24:27.979 align:start position:0%
director of a small
 
04:24:30.290 --> 04:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
non-profit Outpatient Treatment Center
 
04:24:33.410 --> 04:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
and one of the drawbacks of the way this
 
04:24:37.130 --> 04:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
legislation is written right now is I
 
04:24:40.429 --> 04:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that my M late acts
 
04:24:43.070 --> 04:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
are also licensed as social workers or
 
04:24:45.830 --> 04:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors so we have to
 
04:24:48.769 --> 04:24:48.779 align:start position:0%
make sure that we that our staff is able
 
04:24:51.170 --> 04:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
to carry two licenses that's an ex
 
04:24:53.870 --> 04:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
that's an expense for the organization
 
04:24:56.809 --> 04:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
it's an expense for the the licensed
 
04:24:56.819 --> 04:24:59.030 align:start position:0%
it's an expense for the the licensed
professionals

04:24:59.030 --> 04:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
04:25:01.010 --> 04:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
um I get asked the question all the time
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
of why don't you just
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
work as a mental health counselor
 
04:25:09.410 --> 04:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
and uh the reality is because I'm not a
 
04:25:11.809 --> 04:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
mental health counselor I'm a substance
 
04:25:13.849 --> 04:25:13.859 align:start position:0%
use disorder counselor who treats the
 
04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
entire person
 
04:25:17.689 --> 04:25:17.699 align:start position:0%
and that includes their substance use
 
04:25:20.330 --> 04:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
disorder and my carrying the M laidac
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
lets my colleagues know that's other
 
04:25:26.929 --> 04:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
mental other health care providers know
 
04:25:30.110 --> 04:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
and lets the public know that I have the
 
04:25:32.450 --> 04:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
expertise and that my staff have the
 
04:25:37.610 --> 04:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:43.309 --> 04:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:45.769 --> 04:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
So when you say I'm looking at the
 
04:25:48.649 --> 04:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
amendment that was given to us which was
 
04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
shared by everybody on the subject but
 
04:25:51.649 --> 04:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
on the community
 
04:25:53.689 --> 04:25:53.699 align:start position:0%
I see where you take criminal justice
 
04:25:55.370 --> 04:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
out and you say you were going to
 
04:25:58.429 --> 04:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
address that in real making yes there's
 
04:26:01.490 --> 04:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
there is a um a section in the rules
 
04:26:05.030 --> 04:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
that uh that talks about other degrees
 
04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
see one of the issues with uh with
 
04:26:11.450 --> 04:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
substance use is we license people from
 
04:26:14.570 --> 04:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
all kinds of different professions we
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
have aprns who become M laid acts we
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
have Physicians who become M laid acts
 
04:26:24.349 --> 04:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
because this is who they work with and
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
they want to let the population know so
 
04:26:31.130 --> 04:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
when we say that we have a a section in
 
04:26:34.490 --> 04:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
the rules that says uh substantial uh
 
04:26:36.530 --> 04:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
education that is substantially
 
04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
commensurate with and that's where uh
 
04:26:43.370 --> 04:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
criminal justice is uh is addressed
 
04:26:45.110 --> 04:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
because there are criminal justice
 
04:26:48.050 --> 04:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
degrees that deal only with criminal
 
04:26:50.990 --> 04:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
justice and there are others that have a
 
04:26:53.450 --> 04:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
huge piece on substance use and mental
 
04:26:56.210 --> 04:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
health and if you can show us a criminal
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
justice degree well not me anymore but
 
04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh that um that you have one of those
 
04:27:05.809 --> 04:27:05.819 align:start position:0%
degrees that covers the clinical issues
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
then you will be licensed with a
 
04:27:10.610 --> 04:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
criminal justice degree and actually if
 
04:27:12.649 --> 04:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
I may add there is a National Standard
 
04:27:15.889 --> 04:27:15.899 align:start position:0%
right now for alcohol and drug uh
 
04:27:18.469 --> 04:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
counselors who have a criminal justice
 
04:27:18.479 --> 04:27:19.910 align:start position:0%
counselors who have a criminal justice
degree

04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
degree
 
04:27:24.050 --> 04:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay and you also so I'm looking at the
 
04:27:27.550 --> 04:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
so in the amendment you have some of the
 
04:27:30.590 --> 04:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for your licensing right so
 
04:27:32.570 --> 04:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
you struck out but you've also increased
 
04:27:34.670 --> 04:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
for Certified Recovery support workers
 
04:27:37.849 --> 04:27:37.859 align:start position:0%
and you've changed it to 12 from 12 to
 
04:27:39.530 --> 04:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
24 hours of approved continuing
 
04:27:42.590 --> 04:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
education in the 20 so you've increased
 
04:27:46.130 --> 04:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
the number of hours correct and that's
 
04:27:49.550 --> 04:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
for two reasons so when those rules were
 
04:27:52.490 --> 04:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
written we had no uh recovery support
 
04:27:56.570 --> 04:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
workers and there was a request that we
 
04:27:58.790 --> 04:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
needed these people to get uh to get
 
04:28:02.090 --> 04:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
into the field as soon as possible and
 
04:28:05.630 --> 04:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of hours of
 
04:28:08.750 --> 04:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
Education that they needed to have what
 
04:28:12.530 --> 04:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
we understand now is most of our crsws
 
04:28:15.250 --> 04:28:15.260 align:start position:0%
are getting more than that education
 
04:28:18.530 --> 04:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
required by their centers but also there
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
is now a National Standard that requires
 
04:28:24.769 --> 04:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
24 hours and so this gets us to not be
 
04:28:27.349 --> 04:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
12 hours below the National Standard and
 
04:28:30.110 --> 04:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
allows our recovery support workers to
 
04:28:32.689 --> 04:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
have reciprocity with any other state
 
04:28:35.950 --> 04:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
that has a similar credential
 
04:28:39.050 --> 04:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
okay and you say past testing procedures
 
04:28:40.969 --> 04:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
are naturally recognized credited
 
04:28:43.729 --> 04:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
credentialing into entities specified by
 
04:28:45.290 --> 04:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
the board
 
04:28:48.590 --> 04:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
and then you've crossed out
 
04:28:51.290 --> 04:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
either holding a current license issued
 
04:28:52.910 --> 04:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
by the board of mental health practice
 
04:28:56.389 --> 04:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
or pass the examination approved by the
 
04:28:58.370 --> 04:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
board of Licensing for Alcohol and Other
 
04:29:00.050 --> 04:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
Drug use professionals to demonstrate
 
04:29:02.450 --> 04:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
competence too so why did you strike
 
04:29:03.530 --> 04:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
that out
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry could you repeat which this
 
04:29:09.649 --> 04:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
isn't this is I'm still talking about
 
04:29:12.530 --> 04:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
the licensing right right this is this
 
04:29:14.950 --> 04:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
is not for crsws is it
 
04:29:17.510 --> 04:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is in your Amendment right okay
 
04:29:17.520 --> 04:29:26.030 align:start position:0%
this is in your Amendment right okay
right

04:29:26.030 --> 04:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:26.040 --> 04:29:31.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:29:31.849 --> 04:29:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.910 --> 04:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
right well what they did was it there's
 
04:29:39.469 --> 04:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
been a national movement to uh to for M
 
04:29:41.630 --> 04:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
later for Masters prepared latex to
 
04:29:44.210 --> 04:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
begin working uh with co-occurring
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
disorders and so what they did was uh we
 
04:29:50.510 --> 04:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
used to have to take two exams uh what
 
04:29:52.490 --> 04:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
they did is they've now combined the
 
04:29:54.530 --> 04:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
exams into one
 
04:29:58.969 --> 04:29:58.979 align:start position:0%
so that's just taking out the uh the the
 
04:30:01.370 --> 04:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
requirement to take an exam that no that
 
04:30:03.590 --> 04:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
no longer exists
 
04:30:03.600 --> 04:30:06.649 align:start position:0%
no longer exists
okay

04:30:06.649 --> 04:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:09.830 --> 04:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that
 
04:30:11.990 --> 04:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
we as a committee
 
04:30:14.990 --> 04:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
have agreed to look at is
 
04:30:18.110 --> 04:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
removing hurdles from
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
allowing people to practice in the field
 
04:30:23.090 --> 04:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
of mental health because of the
 
04:30:26.809 --> 04:30:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
um so this would be the only
 
04:30:32.809 --> 04:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
and as amended this doesn't seem to do
 
04:30:32.819 --> 04:30:34.010 align:start position:0%
and as amended this doesn't seem to do
that

04:30:34.010 --> 04:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:30:37.490 --> 04:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
but is there any do you have any are
 
04:30:39.050 --> 04:30:39.060 align:start position:0%
there any
 
04:30:41.210 --> 04:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
of course you want people that are
 
04:30:45.170 --> 04:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
qualified to practice in your field
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
is there anything that you think
 
04:30:50.210 --> 04:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
can be done to
 
04:30:50.220 --> 04:30:51.849 align:start position:0%
can be done to
expand

04:30:51.849 --> 04:30:51.859 align:start position:0%
expand
 
04:30:54.889 --> 04:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
legal Workforce I think this does do
 
04:30:57.290 --> 04:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
that okay the only thing because of the
 
04:31:00.170 --> 04:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
because it allows you to continue okay
 
04:31:03.769 --> 04:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
right it absolutely does do that it uh
 
04:31:06.170 --> 04:31:06.180 align:start position:0%
it allows you to continue to work with
 
04:31:08.450 --> 04:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
someone rather than having to transfer
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
them to another provider wait on wait
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
lists until another provider becomes uh
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
becomes available and then if they
 
04:31:18.710 --> 04:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
relapse wait on wait lists to come back
 
04:31:23.210 --> 04:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
to see you but this does not change the
 
04:31:25.990 --> 04:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
um the reciprocity between or the the
 
04:31:28.670 --> 04:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
ability to move between a mental health
 
04:31:32.570 --> 04:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
license and a um and an alcohol and drug
 
04:31:36.290 --> 04:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
license so there is credit given if you
 
04:31:42.050 --> 04:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
have a us an licsw you get 1500 hours of
 
04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
experience credit uh towards your M
 
04:31:47.689 --> 04:31:47.699 align:start position:0%
laidac because what we're saying is we
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
at least want you to get the experience
 
04:31:52.250 --> 04:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
in working with alcohol and drug drug
 
04:31:55.550 --> 04:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
and co-occurring disorders similarly if
 
04:31:59.030 --> 04:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
I hadn't gotten my licsw as long ago as
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
I had I would now have the opportunity
 
04:32:05.689 --> 04:32:05.699 align:start position:0%
to count 1500 hours of my practice as an
 
04:32:08.570 --> 04:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
M late act toward my licsw if I wanted
 
04:32:12.889 --> 04:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
both licenses so it shortens that okay I
 
04:32:15.110 --> 04:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
understand thank you does the committee
 
04:32:16.729 --> 04:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
have any other questions yes
 
04:32:19.250 --> 04:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
representative Fitzpatrick what's an M
 
04:32:22.010 --> 04:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
latex Master licensed alcohol and drug
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
counselor just a little tip you you want
 
04:32:26.990 --> 04:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
to be careful using acronyms because oh
 
04:32:28.670 --> 04:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
I apologize because we don't all you
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
know Master licensed alcohol so we have
 
04:32:35.210 --> 04:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
four credentials under the board of the
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
laidac board one is the master licensed
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drug counselor the other is
 
04:32:42.590 --> 04:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
the laidac which is the licensed alcohol
 
04:32:45.769 --> 04:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
and drug counselor which is a narrow
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
scope of practice only alcohol only
 
04:32:52.189 --> 04:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
substance use disorders then there there
 
04:32:54.889 --> 04:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
is What's called the LCS which is the
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
licensed clinical supervisor and the
 
04:33:00.889 --> 04:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
crsw which is a Certified Recovery
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
support worker
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
and those are the four credentials all
 
04:33:08.929 --> 04:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
of which focus on the treatment of of
 
04:33:12.289 --> 04:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder at various levels
 
04:33:17.449 --> 04:33:17.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:21.289 --> 04:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.090 --> 04:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
this isn't a question but I totally
 
04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
agree agree with the logic
 
04:33:29.209 --> 04:33:29.219 align:start position:0%
of what these women are testifying for
 
04:33:30.769 --> 04:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
it's it certainly seems that we're
 
04:33:32.510 --> 04:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
hurting ourselves by
 
04:33:34.429 --> 04:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
because it's my understanding that even
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
though someone has recovered from a an
 
04:33:41.631 --> 04:33:41.641 align:start position:0%
alcohol or drug addiction never really a
 
04:33:43.369 --> 04:33:43.379 align:start position:0%
recovery there's always a struggle
 
04:33:43.379 --> 04:33:45.470 align:start position:0%
recovery there's always a struggle
always

04:33:45.470 --> 04:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
always
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:33:48.959 --> 04:33:50.810 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
okay

04:33:50.810 --> 04:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:33:50.820 --> 04:33:52.010 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

04:33:52.010 --> 04:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
so we have an amendment that was
 
04:33:57.051 --> 04:33:57.061 align:start position:0%
presented to us that was sent to the
 
04:33:57.061 --> 04:33:58.369 align:start position:0%
presented to us that was sent to the
committee

04:33:58.369 --> 04:33:58.379 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
so do we want to adopt that Amendment
 
04:34:02.869 --> 04:34:02.879 align:start position:0%
the amendment addresses some of the
 
04:34:04.429 --> 04:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
language in the bill
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
that was originally
 
04:34:11.209 --> 04:34:11.219 align:start position:0%
um put in and it also addresses the
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
issue with the dupas the the the joining
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:23.631 --> 04:34:23.641 align:start position:0%
um he do addresses the use of the um
 
04:34:25.609 --> 04:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
let me say
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
it changes
 
04:34:27.959 --> 04:34:29.269 align:start position:0%
it changes
um

04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:33.051 --> 04:34:33.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:35.631 --> 04:34:35.641 align:start position:0%
it adds mental health disorders as
 
04:34:36.670 --> 04:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
04:34:41.209 --> 04:34:41.219 align:start position:0%
addressing substance use disorders
 
04:34:41.219 --> 04:34:42.170 align:start position:0%
addressing substance use disorders
um

04:34:42.170 --> 04:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
it's really mostly
 
04:34:47.269 --> 04:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
I would imagine these things I think
 
04:34:53.349 --> 04:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:55.730 --> 04:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
no that came from
 
04:34:58.429 --> 04:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
um Mr Berry who worked with them with
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
the board to address this and a lot of
 
04:35:03.051 --> 04:35:03.061 align:start position:0%
these things are within the preview of
 
04:35:06.051 --> 04:35:06.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:13.369 --> 04:35:13.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:15.830 --> 04:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
so with your recommendation do you have
 
04:35:17.330 --> 04:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
it I'm looking
 
04:35:19.609 --> 04:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
for I sent it uh it was okay here it's
 
04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:35.209 --> 04:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
what do you think
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
oh I'll be happy to move or to pass on I
 
04:35:40.670 --> 04:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
don't have my paperwork here but I'm
 
04:35:42.830 --> 04:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
asking about the amendment I'm asking to
 
04:35:44.330 --> 04:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment actually the
 
04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
amendment hasn't been
 
04:35:48.289 --> 04:35:48.299 align:start position:0%
hasn't been sent to OLS right just
 
04:35:51.529 --> 04:35:51.539 align:start position:0%
happened then we can't vote on it
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
we can't vote okay so this is what we're
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
going to do it's my fault it smells
 
04:35:58.250 --> 04:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
pretty so what we'll do is before
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
I will go to OLS I'll have the amendment
 
04:36:04.609 --> 04:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
filed and then we will send it to to the
 
04:36:04.619 --> 04:36:05.929 align:start position:0%
filed and then we will send it to to the
committee

04:36:05.929 --> 04:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:36:09.650 --> 04:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
and um I'll have a subcommittee work
 
04:36:12.890 --> 04:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
session to adopt the amendment
 
04:36:15.170 --> 04:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
and I don't see why we would not
 
04:36:15.180 --> 04:36:16.551 align:start position:0%
and I don't see why we would not
recommend

04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
04:36:19.730 --> 04:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
otph the committee based on what I've
 
04:36:22.369 --> 04:36:22.379 align:start position:0%
read in the amendment and what I know if
 
04:36:24.650 --> 04:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
we don't have an objection to the board
 
04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
with the amendment then we can have an
 
04:36:31.369 --> 04:36:31.379 align:start position:0%
agreement in in no and and we can do
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
that Spirit if you will and then we'll
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
meet a quarter of an hour before the
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
committee meets to have the subcommittee
 
04:36:44.029 --> 04:36:44.039 align:start position:0%
to vote on the amendment all right I
 
04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
think I'm not actually on the committee
 
04:36:48.051 --> 04:36:48.061 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee so I can't move it
 
04:36:52.090 --> 04:36:52.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
who's on the subcommittee it's oh me
 
04:36:59.631 --> 04:36:59.641 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan and representative
 
04:36:59.641 --> 04:37:01.670 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan and representative
Fitzpatrick

04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick
 
04:37:02.929 --> 04:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
there's the three of us because
 
04:37:05.631 --> 04:37:05.641 align:start position:0%
representative Sanchez was not here and
 
04:37:07.250 --> 04:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
around and neither is representative
 
04:37:07.260 --> 04:37:08.631 align:start position:0%
around and neither is representative
Wilhelm

04:37:08.631 --> 04:37:08.641 align:start position:0%
Wilhelm
 
04:37:08.641 --> 04:37:10.010 align:start position:0%
Wilhelm
so

04:37:10.010 --> 04:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:12.769 --> 04:37:12.779 align:start position:0%
you can still have an um you have a you
 
04:37:14.449 --> 04:37:14.459 align:start position:0%
have a majority of the subcommittee
 
04:37:14.459 --> 04:37:15.551 align:start position:0%
have a majority of the subcommittee
absolutely

04:37:15.551 --> 04:37:15.561 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:37:18.410 --> 04:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
so as long as you're in business you can
 
04:37:20.750 --> 04:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
still agree in principle that we'll have
 
04:37:24.769 --> 04:37:24.779 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee meeting okay
 
04:37:26.449 --> 04:37:26.459 align:start position:0%
you can't do anything without the
 
04:37:26.459 --> 04:37:34.010 align:start position:0%
you can't do anything without the
amendment

04:37:34.010 --> 04:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:37.551 --> 04:37:37.561 align:start position:0%
right so what I might do is I might have
 
04:37:39.529 --> 04:37:39.539 align:start position:0%
I don't think you all need to come
 
04:37:41.810 --> 04:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
that's up to you
 
04:37:43.849 --> 04:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
um we would have we're gonna have a work
 
04:37:47.390 --> 04:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
session on other things next week and I
 
04:37:49.310 --> 04:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
will have the amendment and the
 
04:37:51.470 --> 04:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can vote for it then all
 
04:37:53.929 --> 04:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
right that make sense
 
04:37:55.789 --> 04:37:55.799 align:start position:0%
but I don't expect any
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
coffee Falls
 
04:37:57.600 --> 04:37:58.970 align:start position:0%
coffee Falls
okay

04:37:58.970 --> 04:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:38:01.010 --> 04:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
so once with that I will end the
 
04:38:02.929 --> 04:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting on house bill
 
04:38:05.449 --> 04:38:05.459 align:start position:0%
Senate bill I mean Senate Bill 44 thank
 
04:38:05.459 --> 04:38:07.580 align:start position:0%
Senate bill I mean Senate Bill 44 thank
you
