00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
good merits I think there's many flaws
 
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
within the bill even the Cardinal agreed
 
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
on the wording of reasonable was flawed
 
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
I think they are going to address it
 
00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 align:start position:0%
through rules especially the want and
 
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
waste which we all agree and the nice
 
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
thing about rules is it gives them
 
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility that if one thing doesn't
 
00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 align:start position:0%
work they can speedily fix it rather
 
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
than having to wait for the whole
 
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
legislative process again so I think
 
00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
this bill should Ito thank you thank you
 
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
um what I was going to say as well is
 
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
that uh given the fact that he's told us
 
00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen in rules
 
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
anyway I think I prefer to let them
 
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
handle it in rules and see where it goes
 
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
than to try to pass legislation that may
 
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
be flawed and then have to deal with
 
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
trying to clean it up in another year um
 
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
represent tutor you had your hand up
 
00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
I'll wave up wave off okay
 
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Fox you haven't spoken
 
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
yet I'm going to let he might say it
 
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair does he have the
 
00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
ability to create rules around the
 
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
hunting contest piece or just the want
 
00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
and waste piece they can create rules
 
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
around any part that they they want to
 
00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 align:start position:0%
do um they oversee most of the contests
 
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
that are currently done as far as like
 
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
the deres and such um so they they can
 
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
create rules around those as well um
 
00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 align:start position:0%
good question
 
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
though any yeah representative Harvey so
 
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
that was kind of my question when maybe
 
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
I misheard but when they were discussing
 
00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 align:start position:0%
it I thought that the rules was only
 
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
going to ad address the want and waste
 
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
and Not the Killing contest which they
 
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
might need um help from the legislature
 
00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
to um definitely ban killing contests uh
 
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
maybe I misheard he did not address that
 
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
they were going to take up the the
 
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
contests in rules yet um but I know that
 
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
there is a framework around those that
 
00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
they can craft rules around whether they
 
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
need some extra legislative I think when
 
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
they look into it they'll probably come
 
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 align:start position:0%
back and tell us what they need if they
 
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
decide to go that route um but he has
 
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
definitely promised to deal with the
 
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
want and waste which is one of the
 
00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
things that we all agreed on in this
 
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
committee and I I think that I would
 
00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
love to see what they do with the direct
 
00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
the new director and the the uh Colonel
 
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
and the and the Commission in drafting
 
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
those rules and having those public
 
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
hearings to find out what they come up
 
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
with representative tutor
 
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
first yeah I think
 
00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh that that that uh the contest should
 
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
definitely be done in Rules by the by
 
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
the fishing game I mean that contest
 
00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
have so many little nuances of you know
 
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
of all the little private pools that go
 
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
on that I don't think anyone really
 
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
cares about that you and I have a pool
 
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
on who gets the biggest buck or the
 
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.670 align:start position:0%
on who gets the biggest buck or the
biggest

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
biggest
 
00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
turkey um and there's you know hundreds
 
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
of those kind of pools that go on for
 
00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
different kinds of things out there and
 
00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's probably the best place to have
 
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 align:start position:0%
fishing game write the rules on rather
 
00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
than us try to
 
00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
legisl I I think two
 
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
we have to look at you know the scope
 
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
because to say during regular season if
 
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's just taking their one
 
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
regular deer that you know I got the
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
biggest one yay that's different than a
 
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
killing contest so I think there's
 
00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of nuance there that we
 
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
need to have fleshed out first as well
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative Harvey did you have
 
00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 align:start position:0%
another comment um well maybe it's a
 
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
strange comment but um I actually agree
 
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
with everything that you're saying but I
 
00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 align:start position:0%
really still can't I am not going to
 
00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 align:start position:0%
support the itl motion because I really
 
00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
think that what you're saying is
 
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
addressed in Colonel Jordan's Amendment
 
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
and I really would like to see that um
 
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
take the place of this
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill noted representative Smith thank
 
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman if they address want and
 
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
waste through the rules process which
 
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.190 align:start position:0%
waste through the rules process which
clearly

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
defined and someone then goes and does a
 
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
killing contest you have want and waste
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
so that killing contest can then be
 
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
overseen by fishing game through the
 
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
want and waste in the rules process so I
 
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
don't even know if killing contests need
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be regulated directly but they will
 
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
be regulated through the want and waste
 
00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
rules good point representative Khan
 
00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr chairman as I
 
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
was asking questions one thing came out
 
00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
to clearly that uh the chairman of the
 
00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game Commission mentioned that
 
00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
he does not know any contest going on in
 
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and also the cornal said
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
that that the Fish and Game Commission
 
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 align:start position:0%
is looking into this for any kind of um
 
00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh new rules that they're going to make
 
00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
so you know I don't think that we need
 
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
to make a new law that they are taking
 
00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
care of it they have the organization
 
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
who take care of this kind of item that
 
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
we always see it thank
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Jacobs thank you um
 
00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
did they address whether or not the
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
contests have to be approved if someone
 
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
were to hold one no they're not approved
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
I don't remember hearing anything about
 
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
that so for example a club could just
 
00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 align:start position:0%
have one so it wouldn't NE they wouldn't
 
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily know about it if it was
 
00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 align:start position:0%
happening um right I guess only if they
 
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
saw it advertised right um and then I
 
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
guess my second point is there was a lot
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
of support in Banning these killing
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
contests and so I just I find it hard to
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
um simply walk away and just say it's
 
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
not feasible I would really like to
 
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
address it so
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ulette uh thank
 
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
you uh just to to reply to uh
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative Jacobs I I understand
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and I don't disagree
 
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
but more a lot of the testimony we heard
 
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday was on
 
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
coyotes and but there's no limit on
 
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
coyotes so if someone is having a a
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
contest in the this 50 coyotes they're
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
not doing anything wrong legally morally
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
they are but legally they're not
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
and that's where it gets a little a
 
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
little fuzzy I
 
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
think representative Harvey then Khan
 
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
well unless they're killing the coyotes
 
00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
at night and they did testify that a lot
 
00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
of these contests take place at night
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
you cannot hunt a coyote at night except
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
for the certain particular season for
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
night hunting coyote which ends after
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
December or starts after December 15th
 
00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
when deer hunting ends and runs
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
through end of February I I believe so
 
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
but but yes you're right except for the
 
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
season for night hunting correct you
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
can't hunt them at night correct and I
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
did not hear whether those night hunting
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
was actually happening during that
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
season or if they were saying that it
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
was illegally being done if it's being
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
done illegally anyway then it's illegal
 
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
anyway and they could arrest every
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
single person taking part of that um
 
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
because it is illegal representative
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
Khan thank you Mr chairman my colleagues
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
I just want to mention one thing I just
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
remembered that is when I asked about
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
those pictures that was distributed
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
those pictures the you know the person
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
who was Distributing they should know
 
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
that where these pictures came from it
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
could be 10 years old it could be that
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
time when they used to do business with
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
those uh skins and those kind of FS it
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
could be 20 years ago so you know they
 
00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
try to you know tell us these are
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
happening but it's probably it's not
 
00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:22.879 align:start position:0%
nothing you know it's old maybe 25 years
 
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
old thank you representative Durkin uh
 
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:30.879 align:start position:0%
make one note not uh
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
everybody although I live and spent most
 
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
of my life here in New Hampshire I've
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
lived down south and I haven't seen any
 
00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:38.879 align:start position:0%
place in New Hampshire here that I've
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
ever haunted that has that many coyotes
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
to begin with that you could kill that
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
many down south yes I'll agree um I
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that's an issue up here like
 
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
the colonel said there are no hunting
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%

00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
chair um one quick note representative
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
KH on the uh when they were mentioning
 
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
the crow hunting um just for a point of
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
reference somebody did cite an ESPN
 
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
article that article is over a decade
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
old so I just wanted to at least put a
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
time frame along with it that being said
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
um morally and ethically it is you know
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
they may or may not be taking place I
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
know that there was mentioned that that
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
they do take place um in the state and
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
people have seen them on social media um
 
00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:48.519 align:start position:0%
there are times too I I think it
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
behooves us to get ahead of something
 
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
like this if it is indeed a trend which
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that it
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%

thing going um so surprisingly um as
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
um uh two of the um Commissioners were
 
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
speaking I actually AG age with like
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
95% of what they were saying uh
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative um stole or commissioner
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry commissioner stole read to us
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
the duties of uh the commission and
 
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
Commissioners a it's right from statute
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
I even um abbreviated those at the end
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
of my testimony absolutely agree there
 
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
there's uh no um uh I find no fault with
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
that and they don't change with this
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
bill this isn't changing anything that
 
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners would do they would
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
still be held responsible for the duties
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
that are in statute uh just because you
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
submit a bill doesn't mean oh everything
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
else you did goes away no you're still
 
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959 align:start position:0%
held responsible to what what the
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
statute says nothing would change on the
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
duties um or the mission statement of
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
the commission or the New Hampshire
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
fishing game um I also agree with them
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
commission and Commissioners and the
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
director uh would work hand inand they
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
they do now they should continue that
 
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't change that
 
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
whatsoever you you cannot run a
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
department if you're at odds between
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
your board of directors and your
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
director if you are at odds then chances
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
are the board of directors can fire the
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
director and get a new one um so it's
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change the way the um
 
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.550 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change the way the um
the

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh consult advise and work
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
together on that um it also would not he
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh there was testimony that um possibly
 
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
this would eliminate public input no it
 
00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't there's nothing in this bill
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
that says you would not hold public
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
input although public input is not
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
required by law except for the sale of
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
land I don't know of any organiz ation
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
that does not open up part of its floor
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
time for public input so that would that
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
just would not change um what I do
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
disagree with is um I did not submit
 
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
this bill in any way shape or form to be
 
00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839 align:start position:0%
dismissive or disrespectful of the
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I've worked with these
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners for the like I like I told
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
you i' I've gone to Fish and Game
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
Commission for meetings for for 9 years
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
I've worked with them for nine years
 
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
different ones I've gone to breakfast
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
with them and to lunch with them I've
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
been on the phone with them so I I'm not
 
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
it was not a bill um as I felt
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative green was trying to
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
convey that I was trying to be um
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
disrespectful or um uh dissing The
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or their work in any way
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
shape or form it is so difficult for
 
00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
them to do their work in the pres setup
 
00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
they have they meet once a month for two
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
hours can you imagine how long it would
 
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
take our house to get anything done if
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
we worked once a month for two hours it
 
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
it it just is so hard for them to do
 
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
what they need to do to to complete
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
their duties and their mission statement
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
and all this bill is does is simply
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
allow them a more efficient way of
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
working so that they can accomplish what
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
they need to accomplish for for our
 
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
Anglers for our hunters and for our
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
Trappers in New Hampshire not taking
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
away any rights from hunters and Anglers
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
and um uh Trappers they have still the
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
same rights that they have now it's just
 
00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:18.759 align:start position:0%
a little bit more of an efficient way to
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
work so that they can get their their
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
work done um in a reasonable and um you
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
know it keeps coming back to the word
 
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
efficient way that's all the bill is
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you point taken
 
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
um I like the comparison that was
 
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
made uh to the fact that the the
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
commission is like the board of
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
directors that sits over the
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
CEO and I can't imagine any company
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
running well if the board of directors
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
was advisory only over the CEO not only
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
do we not have that situation but the
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
board of directors is is personally
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for overseeing the health of
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
the company in the interest of the
 
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
shareholders much like the commission
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
is making sure that things are run in
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
the interest of the hunters and
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
Sportsmen across all of the 11 areas
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
represent and a board of directors can
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
take the Extreme Action of being able to
 
00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
remove a CEO if they need
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
to we don't have that ability for the
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
commission but they do have authority
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
and I think they need that authority to
 
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
be able to make sure that the will of
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
the sport man around the state is what
 
00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
governs things and not one person who
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
sits there as a CEO over the department
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
I really think that that that analogy of
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
board of directors answerable to the
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
people overseeing the CEO is what we've
 
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
been working with all these years and um
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm not in favor of taking away
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
their Authority and making them advisory
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
only I think that they need to keep that
 
00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
Authority um we could debate whether
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
they should be able to remove a direct
 
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
ctor who's
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
ineffective um right now that's got to
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
happen with the executive Council and
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
the governor but um I think in the past
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
we have seen some ineffective directors
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
I know that representative Harvey was
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
here when when I first had to deal with
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
one of them uh one who stood out in
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
front of the room and actually told me
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
um I don't hunt and I don't fish and as
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned having more people
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
in the woods means more problems for me
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with that's the wrong mentality
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
for a director of fishing game
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
and uh somebody who's supposed to be
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
trying to increase the number of
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
Sportsmen we have out there in the field
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
should not be of the opinion that more
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
people out there mean more problems to
 
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.669 align:start position:0%
people out there mean more problems to
deal

00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
deal
 
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
with uh so I definitely uh would not
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
do would not support this bill to to
 
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
make them advisory only and if if I was
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
ever going to support such a thing I
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do it in the first year that we
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
have a brand new director from another
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
state when we don't know what that
 
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
director's like and give them full
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
control of the entire thing so that
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
being said that's all my piece is
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative Durkin yes
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um I agree with all of that
 
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
and one thing I would like to add to
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
this is if uh you remember clearly the
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh said that if this bill
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh was passed that uh you would be
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
getting his resignation resignation the
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
very next day um they're hard to come by
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh and there may be more uh that would
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
resign so keep that in mind
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else representative
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chairman I just
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
mirrors on what you said regarding
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
advisory only could you imagine the
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
commission is closest to the people they
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
represent the 11 districts or regions
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
excuse me just like we of 400
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
represent various towns and we are
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
closest to the people could you imagine
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
removing our capacity to have a binding
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
vote and changing it to advisory only
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
make that to Senate and then the
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
governor has
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
a unanimous decision on what we
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
represent I but we can also override
 
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
that through the appropriate process so
 
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
not not not entirely so it's it would be
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
full hearted to take away that
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative of the people
 
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.750 align:start position:0%
representative of the people
representative

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
Fox thank you Mr chair uh representative
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
Durkin to your point um you know I I I
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
also wonder what component of that might
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
be somewhat of an idol threat because I
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
I do understand their his passion for it
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
obviously um you know it's but there are
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
numerous boards that I serve on because
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
I can't say no to anything ever um but
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
there are numerous boards that I serve
 
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
on where I am in an advisory capacity
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
but I'm doing it because of um my
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
passion for the uh the organization as a
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
whole so um you know I don't doubt what
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying and I feel like he's a man
 
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
of his word and he would um however it's
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know I I I'm always is um a little
 
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
skeptical of things like
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
that representative Khan thank you Mr
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr chairman you covered all
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
four corner of uh the things I had in my
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
mind especially the director just came
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
in from a new job we like to see that
 
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
how she does and everything in future
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
maybe it happen but right now we are
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
fine thank you Representative ulette no
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
wave off I thought I saw your hand
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
before representative
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
Jacobs um most of the uh testimony
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday was in opposition to the bill
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
was there any online support oh I forgot
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
to look that up thank you thank
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
discussion we're doing well TimeWise
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
we'll still have
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
lunch do we

then for that too and let most the
 
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.909 align:start position:0%
then for that too and let most the
majority

00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
report and that is it I closed the
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
hb22 that ends all of the house bills
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
from this committee thank you very much
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
for all your dedicated time and for
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
dealing with such a long day yesterday
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry we ended up right against
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
the wall there um but I'm glad we were
 
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
able to finish this off now without
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
calling everybody in for a special uh
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
hearing just because especially because
 
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
we have several people from Coos County
 
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
and they would have to drive 2 hours and
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
45 minutes to sit here for 20 minutes
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
and then go home 2 hours and 45 minutes
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
which I think is kind of ridiculous and
 
00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
it would cost a state money so thank you
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
very much represent representative
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
Durkin I'd like to make a motion that
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
Murphy buys us
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
the committee until after crossover so
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%

00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
yeah crossover happens around the end of
 
00:24:52.919 --> 00:24:55.789 align:start position:0%
yeah crossover happens around the end of
March

00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we probably won't schedule things
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
right away way because it takes a while
 
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
