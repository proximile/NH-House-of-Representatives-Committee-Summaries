00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 align:start position:0%
have one so it wouldn't NE they wouldn't
 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.469 align:start position:0%
have one so it wouldn't NE they wouldn't
necessarily<00:05:09.280><c> know</c><00:05:09.479><c> about</c><00:05:09.680><c> it</c><00:05:09.840><c> if</c><00:05:09.960><c> it</c><00:05:10.080><c> was</c>

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily know about it if it was
 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.909 align:start position:0%
necessarily know about it if it was
happening<00:05:11.479><c> um</c><00:05:11.880><c> right</c><00:05:12.320><c> I</c><00:05:12.400><c> guess</c><00:05:12.560><c> only</c><00:05:12.720><c> if</c><00:05:12.800><c> they</c>

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 align:start position:0%
happening um right I guess only if they
 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.430 align:start position:0%
happening um right I guess only if they
saw<00:05:13.080><c> it</c><00:05:13.199><c> advertised</c><00:05:14.080><c> right</c><00:05:14.720><c> um</c><00:05:15.000><c> and</c><00:05:15.160><c> then</c><00:05:15.360><c> I</c>

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
saw it advertised right um and then I
 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.550 align:start position:0%
saw it advertised right um and then I
guess<00:05:15.680><c> my</c><00:05:15.880><c> second</c><00:05:16.160><c> point</c><00:05:16.479><c> is</c><00:05:16.880><c> there</c><00:05:17.039><c> was</c><00:05:17.280><c> a</c><00:05:17.400><c> lot</c>

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
guess my second point is there was a lot
 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.189 align:start position:0%
guess my second point is there was a lot
of<00:05:17.720><c> support</c><00:05:18.039><c> in</c><00:05:18.199><c> Banning</c><00:05:18.680><c> these</c><00:05:18.840><c> killing</c>

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.270 align:start position:0%
