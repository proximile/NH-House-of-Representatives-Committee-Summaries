what this amendment does the first
 
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.790 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does the first
the

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
the first thing is um
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's pretty simple
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
obviously the mechanics of that will
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
worked out with
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
with safety
 
00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.510 align:start position:0%
with safety
but

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i know that mr lavoy is here and
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
more than happy to discuss
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
what he projects
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
is how we will do it
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
but you can see on line 14
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
it just says that the rebate check
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
will be sent to the permanent mailing
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
address on file with the department
 
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.390 align:start position:0%
address on file with the department
so

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.589 align:start position:0%
so
hopefully

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:28.710 align:start position:0%
hopefully
people

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
that may have moved
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
address corrected with
 
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.270 align:start position:0%
address corrected with
safety

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
the second
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph seven is that um
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
we the appropriation is that we
 
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.869 align:start position:0%
we the appropriation is that we
anticipate

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's currently 1.6
 
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.110 align:start position:0%
uh there's currently 1.6
million

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
registered vehicles of one type or
 
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.309 align:start position:0%
registered vehicles of one type or
another

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
and so it's estimated that this will be
 
00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:04.869 align:start position:0%
and so it's estimated that this will be
some

00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:05.830 align:start position:0%
some
place

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.029 align:start position:0%
place
around

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
this amount of money the 25 dollars
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%

and it is not in a condition at this
point

00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
where it where it
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
make makes any sense whatsoever
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
to uh repair
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
that parking garage
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
so the proposal that is here is to build
 
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.550 align:start position:0%
so the proposal that is here is to build
the

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
parking garage right out there
 
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.509 align:start position:0%
parking garage right out there
and

00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
it's currently
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
houses the
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
justice department
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
and we are appropriating the sum of 35
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
towards this now
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
not all of this 35 million is going to
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
just build the parking garage we have to
 
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
just build the parking garage we have to
raise

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
raise
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
raz race
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
the building
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
that is currently there
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
move the people that are in there to
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
another location
 
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.790 align:start position:0%
another location
and

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
we also have to
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
get rid of stores
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
now tear that down
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
so that's what the
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's what the 35 million is all about
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
and i know it says the appropriation
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
shall not lapse
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
and i agree with that
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
but i do think that we need to add a
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
sentence there that says
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
any money not expended on this project
 
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.949 align:start position:0%
any money not expended on this project
will

00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
lapse to the general fund or whatever
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
whatever those
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
right words are mickey so
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
and i know that that you can
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
take care of that without a without any
 
00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:34.949 align:start position:0%
take care of that without a without any
problem

00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
so are there any questions that anyone
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
has on this
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte for a question
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for the
 
00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:52.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for the
testimony

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
a couple questions on uh start with the
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
item six and line nine
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh could you just explain what is the
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
purpose behind
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
instituting this rebate first of all
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
we started out with the concept of a
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:22.270 align:start position:0%
and we found out that
 
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.430 align:start position:0%
and we found out that
[Music]

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
it was going to require 92 additional
 
00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:28.389 align:start position:0%
it was going to require 92 additional
people

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:29.990 align:start position:0%
people
to

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
monitor or manage the gas tax rebate
 
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.630 align:start position:0%
monitor or manage the gas tax rebate
and

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
somebody would get maybe
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
ten dollars if if you were driving a
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
regular passenger car
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
and so we felt that with all of the
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
administrative costs
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
amount of gas tax rebate that that
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
probably was not
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
the most efficient use of
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the money
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
and we also looked at
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
we found out well we found out i knew it
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
but i forgot that we have an obligation
 
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.190 align:start position:0%
but i forgot that we have an obligation
for

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
seven hundred thousand dollars a month
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
for a bond
 
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.990 align:start position:0%
for a bond
so

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
that didn't make
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
that didn't make a lot of sense either
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
and so as we worked with
 
00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:41.509 align:start position:0%
and so as we worked with
safety

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
this was one of the areas that
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
we felt we could manage
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
without a lot of
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
extra cost
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
and provide our residents with
 
00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:56.069 align:start position:0%
and provide our residents with
um

00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
you can call gas tax relief
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
in in a different form
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
and so we believe that this was the best
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.870 align:start position:0%
 
relief

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
relief
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
to and and we also knew
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
that by doing this that the only people
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
that would receive the rebate would be
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
so that was why we chose to go
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you mr chairman thank
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
you for the answer and the next question
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
i notice it's a fixed 25 cost
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
or 25
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
for each vehicle registered uh the first
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
question would a
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
a business that has a 18-wheel truck be
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
eligible and then the second question
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
was there any thought given to
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
making it a percentage
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration so that somebody
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
who pays a thousand dollars to regis
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
register versus somebody who pays a
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars every time you add
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
it costs money
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
extra extra money
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
your first question was will the um
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
owner of a a registered semi received
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
the 25 the answer to that is yes
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
but the minute that you start adding
 
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.069 align:start position:0%
but the minute that you start adding
complexities

00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
complexities
 
00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:25.269 align:start position:0%
complexities
into

00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
how you are going to
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
provide the you know provide the rebate
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
it just simply adds more administrative
 
00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:38.710 align:start position:0%
it just simply adds more administrative
cost

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.310 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
members

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%

it came to
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
our attention in the office
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
store street parking garage
 
00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:44.230 align:start position:0%
store street parking garage
was

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
at maximum had a lifespan of five years
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
put the issue of
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
a new parking garage
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
pretty high on our menu
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we had to put on the fast track
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
and as i
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
heard representative ember talking i
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
mean we had to find a place to move the
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
we had to obviously find a new building
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
so there was a lot of pieces of the
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
some have suggested maybe we wait until
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
we can't wait another year to put this
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
on hold
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
to see if it's going to happen
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
we need to move forward now we've got an
 
00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:35.509 align:start position:0%
we need to move forward now we've got an
opportunity

00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
to move the ag
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
and we've got a building that will work
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
they've looked at it i haven't had a
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
chance to get over there yet but they
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
have been done a tour of it in this new
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
facility will work
 
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.269 align:start position:0%
facility will work
so

00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:54.230 align:start position:0%
so
i

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
talked to karen
 
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.670 align:start position:0%
talked to karen
about

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.030 align:start position:0%
about
putting

00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
putting
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
this in the amendment
 
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.309 align:start position:0%
this in the amendment
because

00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
i do not believe we can we can wait
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
another year
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
i don't want us to be in the position
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
three years down the road
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
of not having a place
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
for our members to park
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a
 
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.789 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a
600

00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
space parking garage
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
that will cover
 
00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:28.230 align:start position:0%
that will cover
all

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the i mean we're still going to have
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
the yellow b you know the upper and
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
lower and probably some street parking
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
but this will get you know a good
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
portion of our people off the street
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
you know the architects
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
have looked at it
 
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.590 align:start position:0%
have looked at it
and

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
the the obviously the money we're
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
estimating that the 35 million will
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
cover the destruction
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
of both
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
store street and the
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
building now and building a new garage
 
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.029 align:start position:0%
building now and building a new garage
um

00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
do i want to spend 35 million dollars on
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
a parking garage no
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
do we have to
 
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:17.990 align:start position:0%
do we have to
yes

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's it it is getting it is getting
 
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:39.270 align:start position:0%
it's it it is getting it is getting
critical

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
you didn't want to ask me any questions
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
anyways did you can
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
afternoon representative
 
00:18:56.799 --> 00:19:06.070 align:start position:0%
afternoon representative
um

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
the best estimate we've gotten so far is
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's where that's for moving
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
you know moving the ag out the
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
destruction of the garage
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
the planning purposes and all that
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
i mean that's the estimate we have right
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
now is two and a half to three years
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
so that's putting that's putting right
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
now store street at just about its end
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
at ends of its life cycle at that point
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
and that's why i i i'm
 
00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:40.630 align:start position:0%
and that's why i i i'm
i'm

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's prudent to wait another year to see
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
if we want to put this in the capital
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
budget and move forward uh you know in
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.909 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:14.870 align:start position:0%
i
i

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
i thought about that representative
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if we could delineate it
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
maybe we could
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
again it's it's uh it's it's going to be
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
you know our decision the legislature's
 
00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:31.590 align:start position:0%
you know our decision the legislature's
decision

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
whether we want to use the money we have
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
available to us now or we want to
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm just throwing figures i'll
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
take 15 million you know right now and
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
then bond the other 20 million
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
i i guess that
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know would probably be an option but
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
i'm figuring if we've got the money to
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
pay for it let's pay for the thing and
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:11.590 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
some of it might i mean it it's it's
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's something that obviously we have to
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
sit down and figure out all the details
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
right now representative
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're at the uh position
 
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.149 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're at the uh position
of

00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:27.029 align:start position:0%
of
our

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
session right now
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
you know all the pieces aren't in place
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
right now but
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's something that um
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
i didn't feel we could i guess i didn't
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
yes we have
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
the funding is the policy decision the
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
general court will have to make
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
but the goal of the general court's
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
always been to work in conjunction with
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
the department of uh administrative
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
services and the city of concord
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
to accomplish a new parking garage
 
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.630 align:start position:0%
to accomplish a new parking garage
somewhere

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
store street
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
is well documented about
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
becoming into life the
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
study committee's first study committee
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
you have fixed it
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
so we're online now
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
so in 1988 was the first study committee
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
and they had a legislative parking
 
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.990 align:start position:0%
and they had a legislative parking
facilities

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
committee established by the general
 
00:24:23.679 --> 00:24:24.630 align:start position:0%
committee established by the general
court

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.470 align:start position:0%
court
1993

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
1993
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
there was the doj lot purchased
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
and that was purchased for 2.25 million
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
i believe from new hampshire savings
 
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.310 align:start position:0%
i believe from new hampshire savings
bank

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
bank
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
and and that was um when we established
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
also during that discussion in
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
facilities it was made mention that it
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
was going to eventually work with the
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
city of concord on some sort of parking
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
facility to
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
migrate from store street now for those
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
of you who don't know store street was
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
built and we obtained a lease from the
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
city of concord for the air rights to
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
establish that
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
parking facility it was a lightly built
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
parking facility out of steel i-beams
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
and decking
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
and was established to be actually moved
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
and taken apart and moved at one point
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
and we've had a lifespan of
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
approximately 20 years or so it's well
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
exceeded that because it was built in
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
1990 1974
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
our air lease we still have about 51
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
years left on the air lease with concord
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
it was established for a dollar got a
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
good deal on the air lease
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
but but currently
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
going to 93 we did talk about at that
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
point establishing a cooperative
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
effort with the city of congress
 
00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:32.950 align:start position:0%
effort with the city of congress
to

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
establish a parking facility
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
everybody knew in 88 it was a problem
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
had another design
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
and committee looking for parking
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
facilities in 2004 again
 
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.870 align:start position:0%
facilities in 2004 again
and

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
the acting chairman right now was on
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
that committee actually
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
so it's this issue has been well
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
established that the facility is failing
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's gotten to a point now where the
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
bolts are really on the foundations
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
aren't even secure they're rusted off
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
quite frankly
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
and the stabilization project was just
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
that just a stabilization project it
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't a rehabilitation of that garage
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
it didn't even really take into account
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
much of the decking just prior to this
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation we actually had to
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
condemn four
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
to six spaces on there because there was
 
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:16.870 align:start position:0%
to six spaces on there because there was
um

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
debris falling from below them every
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
time a car parked on it
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
so i think the establishment of the fact
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
that store street is uh is really
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
rapidly approaching the life has been
 
00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:28.789 align:start position:0%
rapidly approaching the life has been
there

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
there's been several
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
concepts done and we worked with das to
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
get us some
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
rfp established in 2019 we had a meeting
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
developed to re-engage
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
an actual sighting an actual project a
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
development team put together to try to
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
get the project off the ground and get a
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
refocus on the parking garage itself we
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
pulled together the city of concord the
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:26:56.799 --> 00:26:57.909 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
um

00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
in the department of justice together in
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
room 210 211 in 2019 had a meeting there
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
and then we spun off from that to really
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
get it going even further to get to a
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
point where we put out rfps and we had
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
responses from engineering firms to
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
establish a design at that point
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
now at that point there was a design
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
that was going to uh and the concept was
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
to include a portion of the garage site
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
on doj to include some office space
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
at that point we were thinking
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
at the time and asking the engineers to
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
develop a plan to include a space for
 
00:27:30.159 --> 00:27:31.430 align:start position:0%
develop a plan to include a space for
doj

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
doj
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
for some of doj a space for uh
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
legislative offices and oversized rooms
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
at that point we were considering um and
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
that and then the pandemic hit
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
so that got kind of scuttled because
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
there were other areas that were in play
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
at the time around that state house
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
capital complex area
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
and that pandemic put all that on hold
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
and actually took some of those things
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
off the table
 
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's two years have passed since that
 
00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.470 align:start position:0%
it's two years have passed since that
point

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
the deterioration of store street has
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
become to a critical need as it has been
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
for decades really but it's really to a
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
point now that it's it's in a failure
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
state almost
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
so that stimulated
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
the re energizing of this concept and
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
project to build a parking garage there
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
the goal has always been to put
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
something on that site but one of the
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
gates to doing that has been the doj
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
resides there so we had to find a
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
conduit for them to go somewhere so
 
00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:30.389 align:start position:0%
conduit for them to go somewhere so
working

00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
with some local developers and looking
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
at different spots the problem is
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
there's 58 000 approximately square feet
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
needed for a doj to relocate
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's what they're
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
i believe currently enjoying and that's
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
what they would want to have
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
in their new site
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
there's not too many places that have
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
that kind of footprint around the city
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
of concord right now in one spot and so
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
what we looked at was
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
what was satisfied by the
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
supreme court and the
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts was
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
a facility over at one granite place
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
that they had
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated and entered into a 10-year
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
lease with an option to buy so that said
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
what's happening over there it ends up
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
there there may be some opportunities in
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
the south building of the same complex
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
so that's where we went to look and so
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
we brought folks together from the
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office from the uh
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
and did a review of that space it looks
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
like it may be a pathway to have those
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
folks have a place to go
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
that being said there's nothing tangible
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
about that yet it's still a negotiated
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
and even an exploratory point at this
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
point and i'm sure the commissioner of
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
services will echo that it's really
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
conceptual right now we're looking at it
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
and looking at reaching out to the
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
developer and seeing what can be done in
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
that in that phase
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general's office has
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
also visited there as i said so they're
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
looking at you know what are the
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
requirements how would it be up fitted
 
00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:58.950 align:start position:0%
requirements how would it be up fitted
to

00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
and what will the cost be associated for
 
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.470 align:start position:0%
and what will the cost be associated for
that

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
so then it comes to the actual
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
construction of the garage the garage is
 
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.310 align:start position:0%
construction of the garage the garage is
uh

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
we've had conceptual drawings done and
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
on what that's going to look like it
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
really is a capacity of approximately
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
600 or more spaces is what's going to be
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
required on that footprint
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
the footprint and the
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
ground underneath it has had geo um
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
surveys done to it and to see what the
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
grounds were like we have all those
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
documents it's not the best of sites
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's not the worst of sites it's a wet
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
site everything here is a wet site you
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
go down nine and a half feet on a
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
drought year and you get water here so
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
going below grade isn't really an option
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
you can always de-water a site it gets
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
to be expensive when you do things like
 
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
that so there are challenges to the site
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
nothing that i don't think that the
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
engineers will be not be able to
 
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.389 align:start position:0%
engineers will be not be able to
overcome

00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
overcome
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
the cost of course is up to uh in this
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
bill indicates up to 35 million dollars
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
so you look at a pre-pandemic cost with
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
from valley benzinger we had estimates
 
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.830 align:start position:0%
from valley benzinger we had estimates
of

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
30 to 32 000 per uh per space
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
and that was uh for a
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
facility that would reflect
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
the dignity and the nature of this
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
historic district so you could build a
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
straight out parking garage for much
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
more economical i think but when you
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
look at how it has to fit the
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and what folks
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
would be expecting from their capital uh
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
historic capital district i think you
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
have some other things to consider
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
so the post pandemic estimate was forty
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a square foot from la
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
valley that was pre-war
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
so the pre-war uh escalation and uh
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
costs we don't even know about except
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
for the it's reflected in the some of
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
the gas costs and some of the escalating
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
costs for transportation
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
so generally a parking garage is made
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
with pre-stressed concrete these days so
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
it's basically like a lincoln log set
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
there's two companies in new england who
 
00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:58.149 align:start position:0%
there's two companies in new england who
currently

00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
do those pre-stressed concretes and
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
there's approximately a two-year lead
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
time to get into the queue for those
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
so that's with depending on design
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
um and the other companies are out west
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
and transportation costs bringing those
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
big pieces would be kind of ridiculous
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
to engage those
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully it won't have to happen once
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
this gets to fruition
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
you asked about a timeline i we had
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
talked with the folks and our partners
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
over in public works and said how quick
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
can we do if we do a design for this and
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
get engineers engaged he said
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
approximately nine months nine or so to
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
get uh because it's a parking garage
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
it's nothing really um
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
dramatic but you do have to include ev
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
sites you have to include now uh the
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
modern garages are designed with
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
autonomous car sites which are
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
interesting because you can get more
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
cars in there because you don't have to
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
get out of them when they're driving
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
themselves so it's the things you learn
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
are very interesting our clientele here
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
in the general court as you know has an
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
average age that's a little older than
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
in some places
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
and so you have to bring that into
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
consideration too when you're looking at
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
proximity and what you'd whether you
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
have covered access over to the
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislative uh complex
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
anything on our state house complex so
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
would that either mean a sky bridge just
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
a covered area a tunnel perhaps
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
so those things are included into the
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
design requests that would be put out as
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
well to say what are the options for
 
00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.310 align:start position:0%
well to say what are the options for
there

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
we've had many discussions with the city
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
of concord uh over the potential uh and
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
possibility of perhaps closing half of
 
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.230 align:start position:0%
possibility of perhaps closing half of
capitals

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
capitals
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
to look at that to see whether there'd
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
be a
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
a working park a area that you could
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
make something over or not they've
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
they've offered and considered that to
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
consider that and that's what we've
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
discussed at one point nothing's uh
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
written in any kind of engineering plan
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
for that yet but it could be a part of
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
the overall complex when you look at it
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
so is this need been established i think
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's very well established and it's
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
almost bordering on continuing with
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
store street becoming a liability
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
for those who don't know and don't
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
happen to park over there there's now
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
double layers of netting there to
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
protect the people who are parking
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
underneath it and people who are
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
traveling and going back and forth on uh
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
store street to keep any kind of debris
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
that may fall from reaching uh
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
any of the
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
people cars
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
uh anybody transporting back and forth
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
so that needs been established the
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
costs are associated with this are 24
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
million or so for 40 000
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
per square i mean per space costs that
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
would include a decent facade for it
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
approximately three and a half billion
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
to raise three and a half million to
 
00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:40.629 align:start position:0%
to raise three and a half million to
raise

00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
raise
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
33 capital about 1.5 or so is estimated
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
to raise the store street facility
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
itself and then the balance of that
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
to look
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
whether there's escalation cost no
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
escalation cost whether there'd be a
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
need to assist doj with the move perhaps
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
those things would have to be ironed out
 
00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:02.950 align:start position:0%
those things would have to be ironed out
and

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
facilitated one way or another is this
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
the best process to get get it going
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's the one the speaker and
 
00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.750 align:start position:0%
it's the one the speaker and
representative

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
berger has endorsed it's it gets it on
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
the table it gets the money's encumbered
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's one way to fund it it's a policy
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
decision you folks have to make about
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
funding i'm here to certainly discuss
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
the need and the critical need for this
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
critical facility
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
and continuity of government quite
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
frankly to keep them going
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
and and limiting liability in my opinion
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh because that garage is
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
rapidly becoming a liability to um the
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
state in my opinion
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll gladly field any
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
questions and appreciate the opportunity
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
to testify a lot of talk without a
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative murray for a question
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and thanks for taking my
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
question i'm just kind of curious uh are
 
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.510 align:start position:0%
question i'm just kind of curious uh are
there

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
new regulations pertaining to new
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
garages with regards to a certain number
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
of ev spaces or a percentage of ev
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
spaces given the size of the garage i'm
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
not qualified to answer that at this
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
point that would be an engineering and
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
design feature i do know that we in the
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
general court went forward and did
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
establish a
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
along with our partners in das over at
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
the new
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
boiler plant where the green street
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
parking is we have four ev
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
level 2
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
charges over there
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
currently and so but it is i believe
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
future proofing is what i like to call
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
it when you future proof something you
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
really look ahead and see what's going
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
to be established what the needs are
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
going to be and try to predict those
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
needs and certainly ev
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
cars and trucks if you look at all the
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
major manufacturers that's where they're
 
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.349 align:start position:0%
major manufacturers that's where they're
headed

00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
headed
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative lynn for what
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know you mentioned that that the um
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of where doj is going to go you
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh one granite place as as one
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
possibility i guess the the only thing
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
that would concern me is if if it it
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
sounded like from what you were saying
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
that that seemed like it was maybe the
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
only place that was big enough or
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
suitable enough and i guess my question
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
is if it
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
you know if it's not kind of clear that
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's actually going to work out
 
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.589 align:start position:0%
that's actually going to work out
um

00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
do we have do we run the risk of having
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
to you know we
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
we sort of commit to tearing down the
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
building across the street and then we
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
have to build another building for doj
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative mr chairman i think that
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
those are some of the things that you
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
have to discuss is i don't believe that
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
new building would be required to house
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
those folks i think you could find them
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
spaces it's whether you keep them whole
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
or not if you keep them in one spot
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
obviously one granite place has a south
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
and a north building i don't think that
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
you want to co-mingle the
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
department of justice with the supreme
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
court or the aoc or anybody that may
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
move in there on behalf of the the court
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
system because they have some separate
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh ideas and
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
and tasks and missions so i think that
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know there there's space and smaller
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
square footages probably available but
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
they would separate them
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
these days everybody works
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
electronically so whether that would be
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
problematic or not i'm not sure but to
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
find some place consistent
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
with that kind of square footage in the
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
city is is pretty much uh negligible
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
here right now you can't find it you can
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
go to the mall in the mall up there and
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
that's probably the only places that
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
have something around 50 000
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
plus square feet
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
so would you have to build a new
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
building i don't think that that's in
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
the in the books to do right now for the
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
house doj but
 
00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:46.390 align:start position:0%
house doj but
something

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
i doubt would happen
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative mooney for a question
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr faf
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
have any personal injuries or damage to
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
property been reported over the years
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
because of store street i'm fully aware
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
of its condition but i'm curious as to
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not any have been reported or
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
we're just anticipating that as a matter
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
of time thank you
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you mr
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
chairman uh quite frankly friday was our
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
most recent report of an injury it was a
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
trip injury on the ramp coming from
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
store street's top deck we've had
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
several reports of trip and falls over
 
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.630 align:start position:0%
several reports of trip and falls over
there

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
we've had reports of cuts on the rails
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
from the rust
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
people using a handrail for its intended
 
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.270 align:start position:0%
people using a handrail for its intended
purpose

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
the handrail is not in the appropriate
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
condition therefore cut the person's
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
hand so i've had regular reports of
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
things along those lines i've had
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
reports of people
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
locked into the
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
stairway towers
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
because the doors don't function
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
because of settlement because of
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
hinges falling off so it's a constant
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
issue over there its proximity from the
 
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.270 align:start position:0%
issue over there its proximity from the
complex

00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
complex
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
even though we have cameras to be able
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
to view that we've had vandalism over
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
there we've had concerns from members
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
and had them escorted over there when
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
they worked later at night and you folks
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
do a lot of your work in the winter so a
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
lot of times it's dark when you leave
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
even at four o'clock we've had to escort
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
folks over there uh because of their
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
concerns for their own safety we gladly
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
do that with our protective services
 
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.550 align:start position:0%
do that with our protective services
team

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
team
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
so there's a an array of issues from the
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
proximity of that garage the condition
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
of that garage and to answer your
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
questions specifically just as recently
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative hatch for a question yes
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just want to go
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
back to the department of justice and
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
where they're going has there been some
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
exploration by them or anybody in terms
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
of placement because this is happening
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
rather quickly in our terms so
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious thank you
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative patch mr chairman um yes
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
in fact we did have a discussion uh
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
we've had some meetings
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
as recently as last wednesday the
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
attorney general and his chief of staff
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
and um commissioner arlinghaus and and
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
um his assistants have uh and members of
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
his team have met with uh
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
with us here for the general court in
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
the webster room as a matter of fact and
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
we've had an on-site visit to
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
the potential site uh to see and do a
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
walk-through and a condition assessment
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
so we've done some exploratory
 
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.910 align:start position:0%
so we've done some exploratory
efforts

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
because the gate quite frankly is that
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're still occupying the site where
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
is the best potential to place the new
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
garage well i didn't question your dude
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
no further saying no further questions
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank you chief
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman members
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
we'll next call on commissioner
 
00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.790 align:start position:0%
we'll next call on commissioner
arlinghaus

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
from department of administrative
 
00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.630 align:start position:0%
from department of administrative
services

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
which could be accompanied by karen
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
say the last name
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good guess
 
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.670 align:start position:0%
that's a good guess
uh

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
well you know who i am you just
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
introduce me um so i'm the commissioner
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
vet administrative services and and
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
karen is here because she's the director
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
of plant and
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
um she's an engineer whereas i've never
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
even tried to drive a train
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh to talk about excuse me can i have
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
your last name again please i wouldn't i
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't writing fast enough karen
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
rantamacki director of plant and
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
and we are only going to talk about
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
section 8 and nothing else
 
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.309 align:start position:0%
section 8 and nothing else
um

00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
before we start i want to say the sore
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
street garage is not semi-safe it's safe
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
and i think that's an important thing to
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
say we would not operate a garage that
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
was semi-safe that's i know what you
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
were saying i'm just i don't want anyone
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
to think that they're in imminent danger
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
that there are any problems it's
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's like that's an important
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
thing otherwise we would put a gate at
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
the end of the ramp and you wouldn't be
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
allowed into it um
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
so there are a couple things uh and i'm
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
not here to vouch for the 35 million
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
dollars that that estimate was developed
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
without our assistance and and i i can
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
look into that
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and if you wanted to talk about
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
engineering at some point we could have
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
public works talk to you about the
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
process um we did do as as terry
 
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.829 align:start position:0%
process um we did do as as terry
mentioned

00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
um we had meetings in 2019 there was a
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
and at that time there was a thought
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
about following the traditional legal
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
department of public works process for
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
for building a building a garage and
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
there were meetings with uh
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
design selection we actually picked a
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
design firm
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
consisted of an architect and then also
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
a garage firm for lack of a better word
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
and then we canceled them a week later
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
there was a there were questions about
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
other options downtown
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't know all the details but
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
there was a thought about
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
doj somewhere else and and building a
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
garage so what i would love to do is if
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
you go forward with this process and i
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
understand that your intent is to not
 
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
follow the traditional public works
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
process and just have the legislature do
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
it on its own
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
which is fine but
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
i would it would be great if you gave
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
some credence to that process just
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
because we invited
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh five or six different companies to
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
come in and spend enormous amounts of
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
time and money to make a presentation to
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
us and i
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
and in the back of my head i can't help
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
thinking we did that we should at least
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
if you want to build a parking garage
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
and that's your choice
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
tear down that building
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
if you want to tear down that building
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
you have to get rid of the people in it
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
or do it on a weekend
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
and they have to have somewhere to go
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
the moving costs to move the department
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
of justice would be roughly and this is
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
a ballpark estimate 1.25 million and
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's derived based on uh an
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
extrapolation from the cost of moving
 
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.390 align:start position:0%
extrapolation from the cost of moving
oplc

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
and everyone else who was in philbrook
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
last year but it's a good ballpark
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
number 1.25 million
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
it is true that there is almost no space
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
in concord that would suit 50 000 square
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
feet the only one is the old lincoln
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
financial building
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
known as one granite place
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
we did both tour that facility um
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
ish somewhere like that it's about a
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand square feet there's a
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
lot of space you'd have room for other
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
people to go into it
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the purchase price
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
would likely be in the neighborhood of
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars to buy that building
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the rental the leasing
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
cost would be but the buying cost is
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
about 20 million dollars
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
if you don't do that i don't know
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
exactly where else they go but you'd
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
have to break them up and move them
 
00:45:53.839 --> 00:45:54.950 align:start position:0%
have to break them up and move them
about

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
and we don't have extra the state
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
manages about 2 million
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
square feet of space in concord in terms
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
of office space not counting
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
corrections and hospitals and stuff
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
and we don't have extra
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
there's some buildings falling down
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
that probably should fall down that
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
you could try to convert but that's kind
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
of where things are that's sort of the
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
big picture on that on that part of it
 
00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.030 align:start position:0%
big picture on that on that part of it
um

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%

another commitment that i have to be at
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%

okay
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
okay i'll talk about the garage over the
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
last couple of um
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
terms we've sunk some money into sorcery
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
to keep it so that it is usable and
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
that's all been bonded money i want to
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
reiterate what the speaker said about
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
let's do it with cash if we bond 30 40
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars to do this it will
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
impact our next capital budget
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
we do about 130 million dollars a year
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh term
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
in capital budget expenditures if we
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
take a quarter of it for a parking
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
garage there will be needs within the
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
state that are not met so if we have the
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
cash let's use cash let's not let
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
anybody in this body or the other talk
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
about bonding it if we can i would
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's about all we do need to do it and
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
i nobody i don't think is going to say
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
we want to try to fix stores
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's just not gonna work um
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
if we are talking about um
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
additional monies for
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
another building we'll have to talk
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
about that whether that should be
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
included in this or we talk about it
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
next term to buy another building for
 
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.030 align:start position:0%
next term to buy another building for
doj

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
doj
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
but that's another big chunk of money if
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking as we just said 20 million
 
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.630 align:start position:0%
we're talking as we just said 20 million
dollars

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
and i would ask that at some point
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
we asked public works um charlie uh
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
commission charlie allen has his people
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
to actually look at the cost to make
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
sure that 35 million dollars is going to
 
00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:27.990 align:start position:0%
sure that 35 million dollars is going to
cover

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
cover
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
with escalating costs we just don't know
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
so we should do that but we need to move
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
forward with this and get it to the
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
senate and that can be done in the
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
senate since we only have a week and a
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
half left of of our work
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
on the rebate um as i said i came up to
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
talk about the other i just want to make
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
sure that when we're talking about the
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
rebate that
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
it means that
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
um whoever has paid the registration
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
going forward too has paid it and that
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
the 12 that goes to cities and towns is
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
being taken out and giving it before
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
they get the 25
 
00:50:06.559 --> 00:50:07.750 align:start position:0%
they get the 25
back

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
because that's important for all of us
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
because that maintains our local roads
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
part of my concern with with the other
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
suggestion but this works and having
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
talked with safety i know it would cost
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
a whole lot more to do rebates than to
 
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.829 align:start position:0%
a whole lot more to do rebates than to
do

00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
the registration rebate well that's all
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um didn't mean to be abrupt
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your input any questions
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
from the committee members
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'm going to assume that many of the
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
other cards are
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
talking about the parking garage i want
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
to go through those testimonies before i
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
get to the rebate on the
 
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.750 align:start position:0%
get to the rebate on the
registration

registration
i

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
like commissioner jasper wants to say
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.630 align:start position:0%

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
i members of the committee i'm really
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
here as a former speaker maybe a little
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
bit into my role as as commissioner and
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
how the parking relates to the
 
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.030 align:start position:0%
how the parking relates to the
department

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to reiterate what you've
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
heard from the previous speakers
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
i think you all know that the parking
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
garage is
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
beyond its life
 
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.230 align:start position:0%
beyond its life
span

00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
span
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
i'm really pleased to hear that that
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
double netting was put there only for
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
aesthetics and had nothing to do with
 
00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.069 align:start position:0%
aesthetics and had nothing to do with
safety

00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:52:10.079 --> 00:52:11.910 align:start position:0%
safety
um

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
so that's that's comforting
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
um that parking garage when i got here
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
to the legislature i was elected in
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
1984 so the parking garage was only
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
about nine years old it's interesting to
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
note when we talk about average age that
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
after all those years i'm still younger
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
than the average member of the
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
legislature i got a few more years to go
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
to catch up to the average
 
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
but this is not a project that
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
was just thought up
 
00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.549 align:start position:0%
was just thought up
recently

00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
when i was speaker this was something
 
00:52:44.319 --> 00:52:45.109 align:start position:0%
when i was speaker this was something
that

00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
my then chief of staff
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
terry poff and i were very concerned
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
about at that time and i've been out of
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
the speaker's chair for uh four and a
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
half years at the at this point and
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about it for for
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
longer than that and that was the site
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
we were considering at at the time
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
i believe that everybody understands we
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
need to have a new parking garage
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
everybody has for probably decades the
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
problem is we keep getting into these
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
details of will where's doj going to go
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know where doj
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
started out
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
many years ago
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
speaker roberts
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
told me that when he was the majority
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
leader for uh
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
a former speaker whose name escaped
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
marshall cobley marshall sent him in to
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
say to warren rudman who was the
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general at the time do you want
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
to move now or after christmas or before
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
or after christmas
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
moved over actually interestingly into
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
the office that i now occupy
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
in the annex so moving the doj around is
 
00:53:53.359 --> 00:53:54.549 align:start position:0%
in the annex so moving the doj around is
uh

00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
is something that has happened several
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
times and and that can't be our primary
 
00:53:58.559 --> 00:53:59.990 align:start position:0%
times and and that can't be our primary
concern

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know not only from the safety
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
concerns that you've heard about
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
from the fact that we have a volunteer
 
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.870 align:start position:0%
from the fact that we have a volunteer
legislature

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
what we've been asking them to do for
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
all these years by walking
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
um you know what a block and a half
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
is disgraceful
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know this is something that should
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
be done anyhow when i was a young clerk
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
of the judiciary committee i had a
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
parking space right out in front of the
 
00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.790 align:start position:0%
parking space right out in front of the
annex

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
annex
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
and over the years we've had more and
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
more people elected the legislature who
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
have walking disabilities and now the
 
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:35.510 align:start position:0%
have walking disabilities and now the
clerks

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
clerks
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
can't have those those spaces and in
 
00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.549 align:start position:0%
can't have those those spaces and in
fact

00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
the city's been very gracious over the
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
years and i want to thank the mayor for
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
his cooperation during my time as
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
speaker and um even now as commissioner
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
we've had to to turn to him a few times
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
for for some help but the city shouldn't
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
have to constantly give up that revenue
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to do what we know
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
we need to do we let the details
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
drive this discussion and so we move
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
decade after decade
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
some someday that garage is going to
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
be unusable
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
and then what are we going to do with
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
our members let's worry more about what
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to do with 400 members
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
if the parking garage becomes unusable
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
then all right what are we going to do
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
with the doj we can solve that problem
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
we can solve that quickly we won't be
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
able to solve the parking problem
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
quickly at all so i would encourage you
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
even though we know this is not a
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
perfect plan that it's come in late
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
we have time to fix it going to have
 
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.150 align:start position:0%
we have time to fix it going to have
time

00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
even in the next session if this isn't
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
perfect to make adjustments to a plan
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
but now we have the cash you've heard
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
that look we're going to affect other
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
capital projects if we bond it
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do that now we just
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
need to bite the bullet we need to do
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
what has needed to be done for well over
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
in my estimation you know 30 years at
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
this time and have a permanent solution
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
so that all the members of the
 
00:56:02.319 --> 00:56:03.670 align:start position:0%
so that all the members of the
legislature

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
are treated equally and with the respect
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
they deserve not have second class
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
legislators and in fact that is what we
 
00:56:10.799 --> 00:56:11.750 align:start position:0%
legislators and in fact that is what we
have

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
by the way we have dealt with this i'll
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
be glad to answer any questions
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
but and thank you for your time
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay as anyone else want to comment on
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman and
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
my name is dan mcguire i'm from epsom
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today on behalf of granite
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
state taxpayers the state's
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
oldest statewide taxpayer organization
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we're opposed to this parking garage
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
on on a couple of different grounds
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
one is process i know you heard from the
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
chair of public works who thinks this is
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
just fine
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
but in fact this is a capital project
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
and this the
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
legislature has a very good procedure
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
for capital projects which is they do a
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
bi-annual budget and all of the
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
different projects get considered by the
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
public works committee
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
who look at those things year after year
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
and have a lot of experience in
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
judging one project compared to another
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
a building that would be around for who
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
knows how long 40 years or more and
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's a capital project and it should be
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
part of that process rather than as a
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislative special thrown in here
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
for a very quick vote
 
00:57:52.839 --> 00:57:54.390 align:start position:0%
for a very quick vote
financially

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
financially
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
i do think this is a time to
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
consider borrowing
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're in a time of low interest rates
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
and high inflation so borrowing is
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
something to think about even pushing
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
the the limits of the normal capital
 
00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.150 align:start position:0%
the the limits of the normal capital
budget

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh next time
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
um then there's the overall cost of the
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
project you're adding a considerable
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
amount i mean i understand that that
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
that location would be great for the
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
comfort of the legislature there's no
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
question about it
 
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:27.829 align:start position:0%
question about it
but

00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
that location adds a huge amount of cost
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
to the whole project the the three point
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
something million to tear the building
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
down the one point something million to
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
move the department of justice
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
the extra three four five million to
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
make it look commensurate with the
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood the aesthetics of the thing
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if they've considered an
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
alternative of simply replacing the
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
parking garage at its existing location
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
right that that wouldn't have to be
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
fancy could be built as a as an
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
inexpensive as possible parking garage
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's not a location that needs any
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
special architecture or whatever so
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
so that's something to consider then you
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pay you would keep this
 
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
building you wouldn't have to move
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
anybody all those kind of things that
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
would certainly save i don't know if it
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
would save half the cost but it might
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
save a third or something i mean it
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
would it would be a lot of money
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
um and then the other thing to think
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
about is more the
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
the sort of long-term aspect of this
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
there are technological changes in
 
00:59:31.119 --> 00:59:33.349 align:start position:0%
there are technological changes in
progress

00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
progress
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
that would make a parking garage in
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
particular kind of a white elephant long
 
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.910 align:start position:0%
particular kind of a white elephant long
term

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking of two things one is
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
self-driving cars
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
you know it's not something that's going
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
to happen next year or the year after
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
but 10 years 20 years 30 years from now
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
you're going to drive to a place get out
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
and your car will go park itself
 
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.309 align:start position:0%
and your car will go park itself
somewhere

00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
right it doesn't need a garage nearby
 
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.630 align:start position:0%
right it doesn't need a garage nearby
so

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
your estimate of when that's going to
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
happen would have bearing on
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
how long term you know do you really
 
01:00:07.599 --> 01:00:08.710 align:start position:0%
how long term you know do you really
want

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:09.630 align:start position:0%
the primo
 
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:11.109 align:start position:0%
the primo
[Music]

01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
beautiful garage that's permanent here
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
or is it something to think about what's
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
the temporary solution what's the short
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
term intermediate term solution
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
similarly there's also
 
01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.470 align:start position:0%
similarly there's also
um

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
virtual reality
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
right that's something that's not there
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
yet but it's getting better and better
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
all the time and if it was to the stage
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
where you could interact with other
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
people as though you're sitting in the
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
same room with them
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that there's plenty of
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
representatives hopefully is maybe such
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
as our the chairman here who doesn't
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
want to drive two hours a day each
 
01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.910 align:start position:0%
want to drive two hours a day each
direction

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
to get here and do the work you know so
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
so both of those things long term
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
speak to parking garages is not a good
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
business to get into i guess is the best
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
way i can put that so thank you mr
 
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.109 align:start position:0%
way i can put that so thank you mr
chairman

01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
all right now
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
now i will okay
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk about the garage
 
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.630 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk about the garage
okay

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i apologize if i jumped in too soon
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
i'm representing timothy horrigan that
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
represents stratfor county district six
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
the towns of durham and madbury and
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
the new garage is long overdue and i
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
know it's
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
goes against our grain here in the
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
legislature to spend money especially to
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
spend money on ourselves and also to
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
spend money before we absolutely need to
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
but i think this project needs to be
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
built and it um needs to uh
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
the honorable terry faff who's a former
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
former state legislator he said it right
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's like we're about three years from
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh the building collapsing that's about
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
how long it'll take us to do it if we uh
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
do it right so i um
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
i think 35 million is probably not an
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
unrealistically high figure i think we
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
should uh go the extra shovel to build a
 
01:02:19.359 --> 01:02:20.470 align:start position:0%
should uh go the extra shovel to build a
uh

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
build a good building one that looks
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
good and it's structurally sound not
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
building on the cheap like we apparently
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
did um well it's almost 50 years ago
 
01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
that we built a building dates back to
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
1975 when my uh
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
father was a member and um
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh we should probably
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
talk about future proofing it we should
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
probably be making it uh expandable i
 
01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.390 align:start position:0%
probably be making it uh expandable i
know

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
we all have a wish list of things we
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
might want to add to that site and i
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
certainly do i certainly um
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
i would certainly say one particular
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
priority is uh the
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
expanding the system of tunnels from uh
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
from the state house the tunnel collect
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
the llb the state house
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
it's prone to flooding and it's also
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
like extremely um inconsistent with
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
the you know dis americans for
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
disability act requirements so that
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
we could probably add a tunnel from the
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
new parking garage to the state house
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
annex across the state house for a
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
relatively uh small cost and that um i
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
think also some versions of plan even
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
consider putting
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
offices a retail space in there which is
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh worth worth considering and
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
i've even thought a good idea would be
 
01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.470 align:start position:0%
i've even thought a good idea would be
to

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
keep the reps hall just as a the
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
historic reps haul and build ourselves a
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
slightly larger facility to meet and i
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
think we found out the last couple of
 
01:03:43.839 --> 01:03:44.630 align:start position:0%
think we found out the last couple of
years

01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
even though it cost a lot of money was
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
inconvenient to meet offsite uh there
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
was more space and that
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
was helpful in a variety of ways in
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
terms of uh
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
doing our work on session days
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
res mcguire brought up a virtual reality
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's a long time before uh we'll
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
be ready to do that um even though i've
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
worked in virtual reality and certainly
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
we already have um
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
the zoom technology which we
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
could theoretically have used i may
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
democrat our party has a lawsuit saying
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
we should have used it but um you know
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
we made a decision that wasn't suitable
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
for our needs and that's uh
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a few years before
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a few years before
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
we're ready to make a different decision
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
on that one and that still doesn't
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
update the need for uh
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
for us to gather you know gather in
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
person i don't think it ever replaced
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
that and um so
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
so i think i think we should go ahead
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
and start building building the garage i
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
drove when i drove here today i drove
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
behind the new uh
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
grand stand for the football stadium and
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
that cost 25 million dollars plus a few
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars for other ancillary
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
processes and um you know they
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's a fairly simple facility but it
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
looks good it should last them a long
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
time and i think um
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
the same same issue for the parking
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
garage which i think is a project of
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
about the same same scope so i hope you
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh hope we begin quickly i hope we make
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
something that's uh
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know easily future proofable and
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
mutually easy easily expandable and um
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
even though it's a little bit
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with how they usually do
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
capital budgeting here in the state
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
which in turn is inconsistent with how
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
they do in the private sector i'm
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
if the uh
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
if the money if the money if the money
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
if the cash is there we may as well uh
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know set it aside now and get
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
started uh started now rather than
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
waiting you know a couple of years to do
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
what's already going to be a very long
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
project and um
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
another wasn't recognized for the uh
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
part about the rebate certainly that's a
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
lot simpler than
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
that thing with
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
collecting receipts for the gas tax that
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
would probably have taken more than 92
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
people to do so that was like just a
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
very complicated scheme and this lease
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
is simple whether it make much
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
difference to anyone you know
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'll probably take the 25 and uh you
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
know spend it on a uh spend it on a
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
burger and a beer at hopping grind in
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
durham and i suppose if they had also
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
had a
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
room to meals tax holiday that would
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of my meal by another
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
couple of bucks but anyway so
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
let's anyway i agree we should um it's a
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
good plan let's make a good plan for the
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
parking garage and we may as well start
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later and uh yeah i
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
think we should probably do it
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
do a good job rather than a bad job and
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
um hopefully
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
oh yes and also i'm on the judiciary
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
committee so i've toured both the one
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
granite place that's a very beautiful
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
facility that certainly would be a good
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
fine home for department justice or any
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
other uh
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
or any other state agency and also
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
the bank building as ever said i mean it
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
at least it looks nice from the outside
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
cramped the roof leaks it's uh
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know they do great work in there but
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's not a good you know it's not a
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
suitable situation for them so like you
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
know that's uh both
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
although maybe it keeps them humble just
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
like that uh terrible looking parking
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
garage keeps me a little bit humble you
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
know i drive in every morning and i sort
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
of know i'm really not that big a deal
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
if i have to park my car in that place
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
that looks like something out of a
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
dystopia but
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
so let's build a new parking garage
 
01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.029 align:start position:0%
so let's build a new parking garage
thanks

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
i can answer any questions if you still
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
have any
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you representative
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
well next call on
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner steve lavoie from
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
are you
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
in a rush to go anywhere representative
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
lads yeah i'm trying to get up to my
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
good afternoon steve lavoy director of
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
administration for the department of
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
safety and with me is scott breyer the
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
chief of our road toll bureau
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
first i'd like to start by thanking
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative umberger for um listening
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
to the concerns that the department had
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
related to the first uh draft of the
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
amendment um and and for putting this
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
amendment forward um
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
we we we believe this is really a policy
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
decision for the legislature and so
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
for or against this
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
but i'm here today to really talk about
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
the administrative component of this of
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
this mechanism so as written
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
there would be a rebate provided of 25
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
to any individual or business for each
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
of their
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle registrations as written
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
this includes
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
all registrations so that would be
 
01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.590 align:start position:0%
all registrations so that would be
trailers

01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
trailers
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles commercial motor vehicles
 
01:08:38.159 --> 01:08:39.829 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles commercial motor vehicles
motorcycles

01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
motorcycles
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
there are about 1.6 million
 
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.749 align:start position:0%
there are about 1.6 million
registrations

01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
registrations
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
as in during february that number could
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
change by the time the bill
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
becomes effective
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at about 40 million
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
dollars 40.1 million dollars in total as
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
it stands today
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
assuming that the language in paragraph
 
01:08:59.679 --> 01:09:00.709 align:start position:0%
assuming that the language in paragraph
7

01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
7
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
is really referring to general funds
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
that addresses our big concern about the
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
impact of the highway fund so if general
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
funds are used for this rebate
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know we can maintain this this
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
neutral position
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
if the highway fund were going to be
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
impacted that would be a concern
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
for for us and for
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
any of the other departments who utilize
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
the highway fund because it's not the
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
healthiest of funds from a revenue
 
01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.590 align:start position:0%
healthiest of funds from a revenue
perspective

01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
there would need to be some coordination
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
between the dmv and the department of
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
administrative services and also the
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
state treasury
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
there'd be over a million
 
01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.189 align:start position:0%
there'd be over a million
1.6

01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
1.6
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
there'll probably be about a million
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
over a million checks that would need to
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
be processed in order for this to happen
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
not sure of a time frame as of yet we
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
would need to coordinate with those
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
other agencies to make sure we didn't
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
overwhelm our existing processing
 
01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.309 align:start position:0%
overwhelm our existing processing
systems

01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
but there are a few pieces too that that
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
i'd offer for consideration to make this
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
more effective from an amendment
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
perspective one is there should be some
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
sort of consideration related to those
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
administrative costs to produce those
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
checks in such a large quantity postage
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
alone is going to be over eight hundred
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
there would also be some special check
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
stock that that i believe is utilized
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
and there may even be special ink
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
toner printing related to the check
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
stock that's used i don't know what
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
those costs are those are something that
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
administrative services would have to um
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
help provide and weigh in on but that is
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
a consideration related to this bill
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
the other piece that uh
 
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
is is has to do with the use of the of
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
the term rebate so currently
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
registrations uh they vary in in amount
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
some registrations um can be
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
significantly expensive and are above 25
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
others for example a motorcycle a
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
motorcycle registration is 15
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.669 align:start position:0%
motorcycle registration is 15
so

01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
using the term rebate
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
and then having a set amount equal to 25
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
brings up a few questions about whether
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
or not a motorcycle would receive the
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
full 25 amount or would they receive a
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
15 amount um there'd be a couple of
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
options to address that we could
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
look for maybe different language for
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
rebates to say it's a flat 25 fee
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
or if the rebate stays we'd have to
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
determine how do we how do we deal with
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
that moving into the future registration
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
periods is that a credit on a customer's
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
account if it exceeds the 15 but that
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
that can all be worked out um through
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
work sessions and in other discussions
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
but those those are the two areas that i
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
think um
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh would be able to to make this easier
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
to administer um and ensure that we
 
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
could do so based on the intent of the
 
01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.390 align:start position:0%
could do so based on the intent of the
bill

01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to address any questions
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
that anybody might have
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
just the concern about the highway fund
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
i would say for the administrative
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
pieces it's just reinforced that should
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
yes commissioner i wonder um a are
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
trailers going to be included and what's
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so as
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
written uh the trailers would be
 
01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.830 align:start position:0%
written uh the trailers would be
included

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
they could be excluded with a change in
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
one could argue that a a trailer
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
exerts a toll on the vehicle that's
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
pulling it and so you would lose gas
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
mileage and therefore consume more gas
 
01:12:36.239 --> 01:12:37.350 align:start position:0%
mileage and therefore consume more gas
and

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
receive some sort of a benefit related
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
to that a relief related to that
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte for a question
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr levoy
 
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr levoy
for

01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
coming today uh quick question on
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
i know you mentioned 800 000 for postage
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
or because with checks
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh could you do you have a rough
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
estimate on the number of man hours that
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
would be involved in
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
taking care of this
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
um i don't at this point um
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
we we're we're confident that we could
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
absorb those costs with existing
 
01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.950 align:start position:0%
absorb those costs with existing
staffing

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
but that would be the piece that we need
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
to coordinate with the other state
 
01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.149 align:start position:0%
to coordinate with the other state
agencies

01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
and and really true up what type of a
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
schedule we'd be looking at
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
this is not something i think that we
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
could generate overnight and the state i
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
don't think would be in a position to
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
produce a million checks tomorrow um so
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
my thought would be with looking at over
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
a several month period uh of coordinated
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
processing on a day-to-day basis to work
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
through that that
 
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.149 align:start position:0%
through that that
volume

01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:46.159 --> 01:13:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
you could do it with existing staffs
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
without the necessity of going to
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
overtime or anything like that
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh there would likely need to be some
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
overtime associated uh with this um how
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
much is is unknown at this point would
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
it all depend upon
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining daily workloads while while
 
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
processing these types of this type of
 
01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.510 align:start position:0%
processing these types of this type of
data

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.350 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
gentlemen

01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
now we'll call on representative land
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%

um i'd like to address this this
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
amendment in terms of 1661.
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
from the policy perspective
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
house education working with the
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
advisory council on career technical

education working on subcommittee
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
working with directors working with
 
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.830 align:start position:0%
working with directors working with
business

01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
have been working for the last seven to
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
eight years and you see the culmination
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
of that effort would 1661.
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want to see this bill
 
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.229 align:start position:0%
we don't want to see this bill
jeopardized

01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
jeopardized
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
next when i look at this amendment and
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
getting on to the amendment i know that
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative want me to talk directly
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
to the amendment
 
01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.750 align:start position:0%
to the amendment
that

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
there's two parts basically section six
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
and seven
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
and part eight and then with the
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
effective dates nine
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
i'm reticent and i would be reticent on
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
the house floor to even think of voting
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
for section six and seven
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration rebate checks don't
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
rise to the level of an emergency
 
01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstance or a safety
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
issue that the latter part of this
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
amendment does
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
now we've had 103 bills this year in
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
house education
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
i've had my clerk who's new
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
walking back to stores in the middle of
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
the dark which we're concerned for her
 
01:16:16.159 --> 01:16:17.830 align:start position:0%
the dark which we're concerned for her
safety

01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
and we know that there's issues within
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
the building but just walking from here
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
to there that's tough for
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
young people to do alone
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's a need to do something with
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
stores i agree that is
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
a significant emergency extenuating
 
01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.470 align:start position:0%
a significant emergency extenuating
circumstance

01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
and safety issue
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
which needs address
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
and i i can support that
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think if we got the bill on the
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
floor and had this amendment
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
alone in other words divide this thing
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
out with a new amendment there's a
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
stronger possibility of seeing it going
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
forward my chief concern is that
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
we have a number of students throughout
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
this state that need
 
01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.030 align:start position:0%
this state that need
1661.

01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
1661.
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
we have a number of businesses talk to
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
the bia talk to the chamber talk to the
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire bankers association
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're all saying help us get more
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
skilled employee
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
people prepared for the career pathways
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
we have a demographic problem we can't
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
see this one go down the toilet
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to amend it for
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
something do it right
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
look at the issue in this latter part of
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
this amendment stores i know there's a
 
01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.910 align:start position:0%
this amendment stores i know there's a
process

01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes but we have an emergency we have
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
extenuating what we haven't done to this
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
point that's under the bridge we need to
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
go forward make sure things are safe so
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
in conclusion i'd like to emphasize tear
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment apart get rid of part of
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
it and move forward with the part that
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
we really really need thank you
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your input any questions
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
from the committee members
 
01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.830 align:start position:0%
from the committee members
saying

01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
none representative heath thank you mr
 
01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.510 align:start position:0%
none representative heath thank you mr
chair

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today i we
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
don't often agree
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
but on this i agree i i am really
 
01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.070 align:start position:0%
but on this i agree i i am really
troubled

01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
troubled
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
um by the amount of work the garage i
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
completely understand it is an emergency
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
and we do need to act on it but the
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
other element of this amendment
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
there are other things that i think rise
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
to a level of much greater need in our
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
state i think about the department of ed
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
there are no curriculum people there i
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
think of health and human services i
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
think of so many other ways that we
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
could spend the money that we thankfully
 
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
have available to us right now so
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
what is your feeling in terms of a
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
better use for this money
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
there are there are a lot of better uses
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
just looking the title of the bill 1661
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
career tech education we're at the end
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
of a round of capital improvements out
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
there we've gone through the 23
 
01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:58.950 align:start position:0%
there we've gone through the 23
buildings

01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
now it's time our how are we going to
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
start going back through this process we
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
need to look at that process but to
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have proper equipment and
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
technology in these cte centers we're
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
talking capital money so that's just one
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
that i can just right off the bat tell
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
any further from the committee members
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%

kathy mulcahy hampson i
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
my privilege to appear before the
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee this afternoon on behalf of
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
the department of transportation as the
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison and the senior
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee um
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
the department has
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
appreciated your support especially the
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
support from madam chair and members of
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
division two for the past several
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
sessions and i know you're familiar with
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
the state of the highway fund
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
i have less to say this afternoon when
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment changed from a road toll
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
rebate to
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
a registration fee rebate
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
issue i'd like to raise one issue the
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
department has with the
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
language of the amendment and i
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
recognize that the amendment was very
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
recently pulled together and i think it
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps is a point that was overlooked
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
but as drafted it could impact the
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
highway fund though though not intended
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
and steve lavoy and scott briar from the
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
touched on this
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to miss an opportunity
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
to protect the highway fund amendment
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
number 1162 specifically appropriates
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
the general funds for the the rebate
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
checks but there's no mention of how to
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
pay the costs that department of safety
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
would incur with the rebate check
 
01:21:14.719 --> 01:21:16.070 align:start position:0%
would incur with the rebate check
process

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the time and resources that they
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
spend translates to money and that money
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
would come from the highway fund unless
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's specifically
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
stated otherwise in the amendment
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much it costs for this
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
state to
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
issue a check i think it's a little
 
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.189 align:start position:0%
issue a check i think it's a little
cumbersome

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
cumbersome
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
it does cost money and there would be a
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
million checks or more issued
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
so we don't want that to impact the
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
highway fund i don't know if it would be
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
less expensive to
 
01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.350 align:start position:0%
less expensive to
issue

01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
charge 25 dollars less at the time of
 
01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.950 align:start position:0%
charge 25 dollars less at the time of
registration

01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what the cost involved
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
with that would be but it's something
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the committee could look at
 
01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
but i asked that and further discussions
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
on this amendment that the costs not be
 
01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:01.910 align:start position:0%
on this amendment that the costs not be
incurred

01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
incurred
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
processing the rebate checks
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
against the highway fund
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i thank you
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the members of the
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee representative mooney thank
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman thank you for your
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
testimony it's interesting you mentioned
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
that about almost a discount a discount
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
is forward-looking
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
a rebate is retro i'm hearing the
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
department of safety talking about all

committee thank you mr chair and thank

you committee members uh for hearing my
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
testimony today i'll be brief
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
um as someone who worked a lot of hours
 
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
working with the cte tuition and
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
transportation committee
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
on the original bill in the original
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
text of the bill and someone who's been
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
in the trenches with cte for 15 years
 
01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:56.629 align:start position:0%
in the trenches with cte for 15 years
now

01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
really trying to advance some of these
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
challenges particularly with
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
calendar alignment and embedded credit
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
without getting into the the build text
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
i was
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
really surprised that we took a really
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
nice clean bill and now
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
we've really muddied the waters and it
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's gone from being the cte bill
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
to being the parking garage bill or the
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
rebate bill so i'm just i have concerns
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
in that regard i don't doubt that that
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
facility based on what i'm hearing today
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
is in dire need of replacement and i'm
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
not opposition to that but my concern is
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
that we've taken a bill that sailed
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
through house education
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
and was expected to sail through this
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
committee with minimal
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
financial burden and now we've attached
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of money to it so
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
my concern is that what is the fate of
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
this bill going to be now
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
based on this amendment
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
mr dodge if i could uh
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
away some of your fears from my
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
experience when we put in
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
these non-uh germain amendments it's
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
generally on a very safe bill that we
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody wants to kill
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the reasons why it gets
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
amended to a bill that's
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
on its way safely
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
we add things to it and they can always
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
be amended out
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
in my opinion there's no need to be
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
fearful of cte
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
and what you've worked on so hard and i
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time you spent on that
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
because thank you i agree with you we
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
need to encourage it more and just just
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
bearing in mind that some of the some of
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill is is
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
a game changer for us as part of that so
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll make sure it moves
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee seeing
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
none we'll next call on
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
steve rothberg for the uh
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
also a cte supporter
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is steve
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
rothenberg i'm the principal at the
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
korean technical center here in concord
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
i don't need to hash over what was said
 
01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:04.790 align:start position:0%
i don't need to hash over what was said
already

01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
has some themes in it that are
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
positioned korean technical education
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
not for today but for a number of years
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh the concept of embedded credits
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
is very very important it changes the
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
way students think about high school
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
whether they earn english credits and
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
math credits in an area they're going to
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll remind the committee and
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
represent wildlife i appreciate what you
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
said a minute ago so there are 14 000
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
give or take graduates every year in new
 
01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:31.430 align:start position:0%
give or take graduates every year in new
hampshire

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
which is obviously seniors mostly
 
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
of those
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's 9 500 korean technical kids in
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire so um out of
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
28 000 students who are juniors and
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
seniors plus or minus 9 500 are
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
occurring technical education
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
so we start talking about money and
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
investments uh investing in those 9 500
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
students which represents a significant
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
portion of new hampshire high school
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
students is huge and uh this little bill
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate what you said earlier
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative weiler and i know
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative berger is very passionate
 
01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
about it too and there are other folks
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
here who have been very involved how
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
important it is to
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
build a new building give the rebates
 
01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's not my comment in fact building a
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
building be great because our
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
construction students love places to
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
work um but in a larger sense it's just
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
so important that uh these this bill
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
continues on and is seen as as a
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
separate entity whatever whatever
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr rothenberg
 
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
principal rothenberg any questions
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
well mcguire did you want to add
 
01:27:32.719 --> 01:27:36.709 align:start position:0%
well mcguire did you want to add
anything

01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
so first of all just briefly to
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
speak to representative lad's point i
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
it's likely
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
this is not likely to cause a problem in
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
the house in the sense that if off to
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
pass with amendment doesn't doesn't go
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
through i would think that the speaker
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
would allow you to divide the question
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
and vote separately
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
on sections one through five and the
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
other sections and so on um it does it's
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
it still is a possible problem when it
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
gets to the governor because he can
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
either only veto the whole thing or not
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
but but as far as the house goes i don't
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
think it's a serious problem
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
and obviously the senate is used to
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with bills of multiple issues so
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
it might be worth
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
giving them a little of their own back
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.470 align:start position:0%
but um
anyways

01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to speak i came here today
 
01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:29.130 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak against the original
 
01:28:29.130 --> 01:28:30.870 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak against the original
[Music]

01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
reduction for the exact same reason that
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
the department of safety objected to it
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
because it's easy to see that the
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
highway fund is going to be in trouble
 
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
in the next budget cycle
 
01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
right the cost of gas is way up that
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
means the cost of asphalt is up
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
the cost of diesel is up and so on and
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
also people will be driving less so the
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
gas tax revenues will be down you don't
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
have to be nor major to figure that out
 
01:28:55.679 --> 01:28:56.390 align:start position:0%
have to be nor major to figure that out
right

01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
so so anything that hurts the highway
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
fund is something you want to stay off
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
of uh this year but if it's strictly
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
general funds then it's certainly up to
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
you how you spend them and whatever i
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
mean there's plenty of other places to
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
to do things with the general funds but
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh including leaving them for the next
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
budget so but that's up to you thank you
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments any uh
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
