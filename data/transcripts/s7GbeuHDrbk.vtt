morning good morning um and best wishes
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
from commissioner Weaver who of course
 
00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
is at Governor's commission which seems
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
to have found a way to conflict with us
 
00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:09.469 align:start position:0%
to have found a way to conflict with us
um

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
frequently um but we thought today for
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's update we talk a
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
little bit about uh a topic first you
 
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 align:start position:0%
know a lot about which is the the YDC
 
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
rebuild and then also go into a little
 
00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
bit more detail for the record about the
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
system of care assessment work that
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner Tilly um is
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
helping Spearhead and builds on many of
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
the conversations around uh building out
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
our Behavioral Health System and um and
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
in particular increasing uh alternatives
 
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
to residential treatment which you've
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
been also quite deep on so good
 
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
morning so first on the uh YDC rebuild
 
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
so we have been working very hard since
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
selecting The Architects um to build the
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
new Youth Development Center facility
 
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
it's been about a month intensive
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
process of Designing a state-of-the-art
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
architecturally secure therapeutically
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
oriented facility um that is very much
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
first of its kind in the US for uh
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
avoiding a highly Correctional approach
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
and instead uh leveraging a a
 
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutically centered one um and as
 
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
part of that it will be located on the
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
same campus as Hamstead hospital and
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
residential facility um in Hamstead New
 
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um in a very good neighborhood
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
I might add of course and so it has been
 
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
this intensive process um actually come
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
to think of it it's almost closer to a
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
year of design development um and we're
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
now at the at the stage of uh actual
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
construction documents being finalized
 
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
those will be posted for prospective um
 
00:07:58.749 --> 00:07:58.759 align:start position:0%
construction vendors to view uh on the
 
00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:00.919 align:start position:0%
basically the very beginning of August
 
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
um and that gives bid biders about a
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
month to decide and to prepare their
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
bids um and then those bids are due in
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh September or October I forget the
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
exact date with the goal of making a
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
November governor and council meeting to
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
bring the contract forward um gives us a
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of wiggle room recognizing
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
that the arpa dollars need to be
 
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
encumbered by the end of this calendar
 
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
year um construction will then begin
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
immediately uh and we expect final
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
completion by the summer of
 
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919 align:start position:0%
2026 um allowing the closure of the
 
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
current Sno Services Center and movement
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
into the new facility thereafter so um
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
so lots of great work going on it's been
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
highly collaborative um you of course uh
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson serve in a number
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
of capacities including on our DHHS
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
convened stakeholder advis committee um
 
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
we've been um having a lot of
 
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
conversations also with Senator bird
 
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
cell's um Community impact commission
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
around the variety of issues from Land
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
water safety programming Staffing
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
traffic and every other imaginable um
 
00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:17.959 align:start position:0%
impact and I think are committed to
 
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining that that process of
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
collaboration but also really engaging
 
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
with our teams on the most um effective
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
Staffing and uh training model to make
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
this place uh one of of great um
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
habilitation and healing um and setting
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
youth on a on a very bright uh path
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
forward um and so happy to take any
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
questions on that before I hand it over
 
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
to associate commissioner Telly by
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
encumbered how is that defined so the
 
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
funds have to be actually in contract
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
with a cont yep so there has to be a
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
contract signed with a construction
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
build also uh when the construction
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
documents are posted say ballpark August
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
one will that be open to the public to
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%

today for a presentation so um I have
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity today to talk a little
 
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
bit about our children's Behavioral
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
Health System of care and how we're
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
setting a path towards a new s so that
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
we sometimes call that system of care so
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
2.0 um before I get there I want to do a
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
little history and then sort of come
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
back to where we are right now so this
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
session the department had the privilege
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
of tracking just shy of 680 bills we
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
provided fiscal analysis on about 185 of
 
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
those bills on a huge array of topics
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
from privacy confidentiality Health Care
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
child care that you're going to hear
 
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
more about cannabis all sorts of fun
 
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
things um but some of the most important
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
policy conversations in my mind really
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
centered on Mental Health um the child
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
protection system and our children's
 
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
residential um care so for years the
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
legislature has recognized and has been
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
supportive of the needs of kids and
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
their families um sometimes in Leaps and
 
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
Bounds and sometimes in small increment
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
increments we have built we have sort of
 
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
put together this system that we have
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
right now in my role previously in
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
public health you know I have been
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
around for several permutations of this
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
development quite frankly for decades in
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
2010 I was on the original behavoral
 
00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
Health collaboratives partnering with
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
Advocates philanthropy providers the
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
department and that laid the foundation
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
of sort of the hopes and dreams of what
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
a system of care could be we learned a
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
lot from families we learned a lot about
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
what was working but really more
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
importantly what wasn't working and
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
that's where we really started to build
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
this out by 2016 we um sp sp 534 created
 
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.710 align:start position:0%
this out by 2016 we um sp sp 534 created
RSA

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
135f which required the state to develop
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
and maintain this integrated
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Service delivery approach
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
for children's Behavioral Health needs
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
that is the first time you really start
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
seeing system of care in legislation is
 
00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
right about 2016 after that we have the
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
10e mental health plan in the 2018 area
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
with more investments from the Governor
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
from the legislature and by 2019 we had
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
even more legislation signed and we
 
00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:05.959 align:start position:0%
connected that system of care to other
 
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
child serving systems like DCF so fast
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
forward to today um and throughout all
 
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
those long hearings and longer
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
amendments that we all sat through this
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
session um we I believe we have
 
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
strengthened and started to refine the
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
system of care um but you still for
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
those of you who aren't in this work all
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
the time like you and I are um there may
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
be some questions about what what
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
exactly is that um you know and so I'd
 
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
like to just spend just a couple of
 
00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
minutes reminding folks about this thing
 
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
called a system of care in that it is
 
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
both a strategy and a particular set of
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
services it offers an integrated
 
00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:50.839 align:start position:0%
delivery structure for comprehensive
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Services it is also a
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
work in progress um on the handout in
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
front of you um you'll see a DI diagram
 
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
that has been used often to visualize
 
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
what a tiered and coordinated system
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
that organizes services and exp um
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
supports into five layers so you'll see
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
what that looks like that is a document
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
that we've used many times before at
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
least a visual that we've used many
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
times that talks about um the from the
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
lower levels of tier tier one to higher
 
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
levels of intensity which is tier five
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
which is an acute psychiatric hospital
 
00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
setting so across that entire system
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
so um what I'm going to do this morning
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
is we know that needs have changed since
 
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
those early days in the 2000s notably in
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
the volume and the complexity um and so
 
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
we need to ensure that this system that
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
we've envisioned that Circle those five
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
tiers is able to continue to grow and
 
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
continue to respond to those needs of
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
families so I'm going to walk you
 
00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:53.759 align:start position:0%
through what we have give you an update
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
on what's the work ahead of us and of
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
course we would love to to hear your
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
feedback so Where Do We Begin and and
 
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just walk very quickly
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
through those five tiers because I think
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's important because often times in
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
legislation amendments we throw numbers
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
out oh that's like a one or that's like
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
a two or that institution is a level
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
five and I think that that can become um
 
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's time to step back and just
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
sort of go what how do we put that into
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
context what does that really mean so
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
again tier one is exactly what you would
 
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959 align:start position:0%
expected to be it is the entrylevel um
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
area of the system it's where you go it
 
00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:30.519 align:start position:0%
is screening an assessment it's work
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
with your pediatricians your family docs
 
00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:36.519 align:start position:0%
your schools and where basic assessment
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
happens basic screening happens um for
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
General Health and Wellness this is much
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
like your well child visit you know you
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
go you get your shots you learn about
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
all sorts of things or even as an adult
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
you go for your annual physical and you
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
talk about your overall wellness and so
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
we need to support that we can't just
 
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
start thinking about the system of Care
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
at residential care we actually have to
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
start at this very beginning thinking
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
about what happens in those trusted
 
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
relationships with your health care
 
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
provider and your family so that's where
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
we start in tier one by tier two you you
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
sort of start moving from screening to
 
00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
treatment um tier 2 Services include
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
outpatient treatments that address
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
specific mental health conditions like
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
depression anxiety perhaps aggressive
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
behavior in a kid kiddo um these
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
Services can also include alation
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
treatments for um to treat a youth's uh
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
alcohol or drug use these services are
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
provided by Behavioral Health
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
Specialists or agencies sometimes within
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
the context of a school who are by staff
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
who are specifically trained or
 
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
credentialed to provide that type of
 
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
treatment so again one step up from your
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
pediatrician set you know having a
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
conversation about your child's Wellness
 
00:16:50.189 --> 00:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
into treatment that is actually about a
 
00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:53.079 align:start position:0%
specific condition um tier 2 Also may
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
have some case management As you move
 
00:16:57.069 --> 00:16:57.079 align:start position:0%
forward but again you know if you think
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
about it in the medical um healthc care
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
system I I go to my doctor I get
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
screened for diabetes I may get treated
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
for diabetes this is sort of at that
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
level where I'm treated for that
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
condition yes what uh level of direct
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
oversight does the department have on
 
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
these agencies and schools who are now
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
intervening at step two sure so at step
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
two I mean that I you know the
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
department may have some role in there
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
um but it would be through our regular
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
systems whether that's the community
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers whether it's the
 
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
that's really the standard of care and
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's the the degree to which we would
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
have oversight we have supported special
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
projects such as um you know uh
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
interesting collaborations with
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Center like
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
Amis Health who is now providing that
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
care within the school so we have some
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
contractual oversight but we expect that
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
everyone follows the standard of care
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
that they would have that they have for
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
their particular certification or level
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
of care it's good to expect it do you
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
supervise it to make sure your
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
expectations in the same way in the same
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
way that we don't oversee necessarily if
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
you get the standard of care for your
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
diabetes okay so you know it's at that
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
level standard care outpatient we have a
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
relationship with some programs um but
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
really the expectation is that folks are
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
following um what they are credential to
 
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
do and within the scope of their it
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
would it would be akin to what I know in
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
the medical world absolutely okay thank
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely so you know then we get a
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
little bit closer and then we get to a
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
place where the department has a closer
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
touch to this which is around tier three
 
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
and this is really what I like to think
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
about tier three is where we prevent
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
escalation one and two is just standard
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
of care getting the care that you need
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the community Guided by a family in
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
the case of children Guided by the
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
family they're getting the care that
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
they need in a routine outpatient
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
setting by tier three we start looking
 
00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
at complex situations where families
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
caregivers and providers are doing what
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
they can but something might not be
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
working tier three services are meant to
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
bring families and youth together with
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
all of the people in their support
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
networks in their clinical support
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
networks and their home support networks
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
to meet their needs and you know this is
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
where we start seeing this idea of a
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
wraparound this is where we start
 
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
wrapping services around a family they
 
00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
are more intensive this is where the
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of children's behavioral
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
health is more likely to get involved
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
and have a a closer touch on those
 
00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
Services um so and I think for me as you
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
know I step into this work this is where
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
we need to spend a lot of attention
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
because it's these Services these
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
wraparound that are happening within the
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
community within a family's you know
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
keeping kids at home um and out of more
 
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
restrictive care this this is where we
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
need to invest in our promising
 
00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
approaches um and make sure that this
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
work is done really well because again
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
it it's designed to prevent escalation
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
into higher needs and quite frankly into
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
what's tier four which is Residential
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
Treatment you know there is um I want to
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
say that residential treatment is an
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
important part it you know it is part of
 
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
our budget conversations it is part of
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
our policy conversations it's critical
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
need for some families and for some
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
youth um but this is where Services
 
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
become intensive quite frankly also
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
expensive you know the goal is always to
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
keep youth in their families and within
 
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
their communities but there are times
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
when youth may just need to go into a
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
residential program to be safe and to
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
get the treatment they need would this
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
be Hamstead Hospital not yet no not the
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
new building the existing building so so
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
yes to some degree so tier four this is
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
where we get some numbers sort of flying
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
around so this is tier four in our
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
system but within this tier four if you
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
look at little document there are
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
multiple levels of care there are five
 
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
levels of care so yes the prtf at
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
Hamstead would be level five but there
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
are four levels before you even get to
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
Hamstead prtf okay um could I have a
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
list at some point of what descriptors
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
of each level is because last time I
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
wandered through my neighborhood Mental
 
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
Health Center um somebody was so excited
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
because we're retrofitting this to go
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
from level two to level three and all I
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
could say was that's nice yeah
 
00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely I mean level one is usually
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
treatment programs where um we are
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
working towards older youth often that
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
have been in the dcyf system and they're
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
becoming more independent aging out of a
 
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
children's services program and so this
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
is where there may not be ex um
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
extensive therapeutic um work but really
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
just working on transitioning kids out
 
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
into the community as they get older
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
we've had about 16 kids in that level of
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
service in back in May um then we get to
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
level two which again is Residential
 
00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
Services these are 24 hours a day you
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
know supervision 24/7 they include a
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
combination of targeted Residential
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
Treatment Services and community-based
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
treatment services you then sort of ramp
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
up to level three again all in this
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%
level four box but you ramp up to level
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
three services and this is um treatment
 
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
that includes you know really structured
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
behavioral health treatment and
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
educational programming provided within
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
the facility to and it often what you
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
want to do is you put that investment so
 
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
that ultimately you can get kids back
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
down back into closer to their community
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then when you get into levels four
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
and five that's when you get into
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
intensive Subacute acute care um
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
residential care for kids that's where
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
you start getting to the prtf that is
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
located at Hampstead so again lots of
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
levels we're happy to provide you a a
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
little cheat sheet that sort of talks
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
you through it but it's been my
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
experience that you know I think in many
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
of these conversations we start throwing
 
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
numbers around and I think it probably
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
can be mindboggling to anyone who's not
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
in this world every single day I would
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
call it an education enhancement device
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
but cheat sheet will work that's great
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
so you know again level five prtf
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
psychiatric residential treatment
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
facilities they provide immediate safety
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
physical and mental health assessment
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
and monitoring they provide medication
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
when it's needed and treatment for those
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
kids who are experiencing a serious
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
psychiatric emergency you know this
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
really should be at the very highest
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
level of need um in may we had 11
 
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
children um New Hampshire children who
 
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
were receiving level five care so and
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
then then so that was still tier four of
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
our system of care and then you get to
 
00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
tier five which is the acute
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
hospitalization Hamstead hospital that
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
is for that acute level of care
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully a shorter time in duration
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
where we're really stabilizing children
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
who are in immediate need and have a
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
very high level of Acuity of care okay
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
question on that because when I did that
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
walk around of Hamet hospital they were
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
retrofitting a unit and they did use an
 
00:24:24.669 --> 00:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
ascending number we're moving it from I
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't know 2 to three or 3 to four so
 
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:29.559 align:start position:0%
does that fit under tier four descriptor
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
or tier five I'm not sure the timing was
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
this pretty
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
recent was was was this in the past year
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
or longer ago okay so the renovations um
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I don't know the
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
reference to the number it probably had
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
to do with a sort of architectural
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
security but two of the impatient units
 
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
were were renovated to have more um
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
basically to remove drop ceilings to
 
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
avoid um youth pushing up the ceiling
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
tiles and having issues so it just seen
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
as a safer um Improvement and also some
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
effects to reduce some of the noise
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
echoing so it's it's it was some
 
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
intensive um construction work but it
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
was it's still within the impatient
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
environment it could well be that that's
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
what the the numbers referred to is yeah
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps I haven't heard any numbers on
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
that but that's different than the the
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
Myriad levels uh that the associate
 
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner is talking about the cheat
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
sheet would be welcome yes absolutely
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
more happy to do that so you know I
 
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
think this is all oh I'm
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
sorry yes representative Merchant thank
 
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you Mr chair I just
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
want to be clear where I'm think we're
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
going but when I look at the word
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
behavioral versus mental health I think
 
00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:39.559 align:start position:0%
of them as being really distinctly
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
different and when I think of mental
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
health I think of something that's
 
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
really rooted into a medical condition
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
like psychosis schizophrenia whatever
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
else is going on which is beyond the
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
individual ability to control it I
 
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.510 align:start position:0%
individual ability to control it I
alluded

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
alluded
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
to type 2
 
00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
diabetes you can do a L with type 2
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
diabetes with the treatment but you
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
could do a lot more with prevention by
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
changing one's lifestyle so in this
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
process here are we focused
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
on children that we need to treat
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
because we doing up on the prevention
 
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
side I mean part of it comes down
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
to family and modeling of behavior and
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
if you have children that are raised in
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
a family with dynamics that are not
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
healthy they will eventually transcend
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
themselves into behavioral issues so
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
what are we doing to help the family the
 
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
children a very young age to begin to
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
understand what is appropriate modeling
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
of what's appropriate behavior versus
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
waiting until they get to be a teenager
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
when it's sort of out of control so
 
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to get to in here
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
how does this address that that that is
 
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
like the million-dollar question
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant so I think in
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
here that's where the efforts that I
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
feel like we need to have even stronger
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
work or more coordinated work is sort of
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
in those Beginnings that tier one tier 2
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
area where you're working with families
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
very early on from Early Childhood
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
you're providing opportunities for
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
support for families Family Support
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
parent education home visiting programs
 
00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:18.919 align:start position:0%
um we uh we also have some Early
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
Childhood wraparound programs for uh
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
youth at the very young stage who are
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
exhibiting behavior that is concerning
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
but we also know that we want to make
 
00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:30.039 align:start position:0%
sure that we are reducing any impacts of
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
trauma um many of the children who are
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
within our children's system of care are
 
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
also in our division for children youth
 
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
and services they have been impacted by
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
trauma in their own life by Family
 
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
instability so this is where really
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
where it does take a village this is
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
where concrete supports for families
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
making sure that they have the care so
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
that they can provide the best care for
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
their their own children um and have uh
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
supportive environments to um ensure
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
that we can address some of those
 
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
behaviors you know your question around
 
00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:02.519 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health we use that very
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
consciously because we know that there
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
are both mental health conditions which
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
certainly can um be experienced by even
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
very young children but we also know
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
that there's some behavioral context as
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
well as issues with things like
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
substance use so we want to put that all
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
with under that same umbrella because
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
the system Sim similarly works in the
 
00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
way that you want to do the preventative
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
work early on and then get into the more
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
um acute needs as you you know hopefully
 
00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
prevention thank it's very
 
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519 align:start position:0%
helpful where I'm sort of trying to get
 
00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
to is that in partnering with people and
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
the I think individuals or professions
 
00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:55.519 align:start position:0%
that could be extremely valuable here
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
and we have another discussion coming up
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
in this later is the role of the school
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
nurse my wife spent 25 years in the
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
school system and she could articulate
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
the students who had issues way before
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
they became a problem so what are we
 
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
doing to engage the school nurse and
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
help them become part of the solution to
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
at least get either identify the student
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
who needs help or get them to the
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
resources need help because it's a
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
vastly underutilized resource in our
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
system is there are the and years of
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
what's really going on out there both in
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
behavioral issues food insecurity issues
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
they're for the most part of what I call
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
a safe trusted individual within the
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
school system they don't judge students
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
they don't give grades they're the ones
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
that give the Band-Aids hold their hands
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
so what are we doing from the
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
Department's point of view to fully
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
engage with a school nurse sure so I I
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
think you're you really hit an important
 
00:29:56.509 --> 00:29:56.519 align:start position:0%
point they are clearly an
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
underutilized set of Professionals for
 
00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:00.919 align:start position:0%
us within the department individually
 
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
when we get to those areas of wraparound
 
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
care you know our teams are deeply
 
00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
engaging with individual School nurses
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
on individual children's care that
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely is happening I think there's
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of opportunity though to even step
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
back a little bit and really engage
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
earlier in that process in some of those
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
ideas around prevention and early
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
screening school health is remarkably
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
important and those nurses are on the
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
front line you know I always go back to
 
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
my experience in public health we could
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
not have done what we did without school
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
without nurses you know we were on the
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
phones with nurses every single day and
 
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right they um fill
 
00:30:40.269 --> 00:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
that void they make they know who who
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
had dinner or who had dinner or who had
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
breakfast before they came to work they
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
know who has clean clothes to wear they
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
know who's experiencing problems they
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
know when someone come you when a kiddo
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
comes with a tummy ache that that might
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
represent a whole number of issues and
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
so you're absolutely right I think
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of opportunity for us to
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
be more intentional in the way that we
 
00:31:01.389 --> 00:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
work with the school nurse the school
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
nurse world even in a much more
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
preventative way than when we work with
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
them on a specific
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
child so we've got this fancy system and
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
I don't want to take too much of your
 
00:31:14.909 --> 00:31:14.919 align:start position:0%
time what we're really excited about
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
though is um we are looking at the need
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
to to relook to assess where our system
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
is today we have seen that um you know
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
know we all want kids to be safe healthy
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
thriving in their communities we want to
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of kids that are in
 
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
need of residential inpatient treatment
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
I think that's a common goal for all of
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
us we want to improve the Alternatives
 
00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
and step down from and to out of home
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
placements including the most complex
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
youth for whom specialized trauma
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
informed care supports are really needed
 
00:31:56.909 --> 00:31:56.919 align:start position:0%
so we have put our heads together to say
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
to to work with Partners out um
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
specifically with the University of
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
Connecticut to help us look at where we
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
are today give us a point intime
 
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
assessment understand where we are in
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
relation to our goals but also
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
understand where we are in relation to
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
the experiences that we're having right
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
now we can all think about the traumas
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
that we have collectively experienced
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
since when we first put those in those
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
initial building blocks of the system of
 
00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:26.519 align:start position:0%
care together we have lived through a
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
global pandemic we lived through an
 
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
opioid EP a pandemic as well we have a
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
different set of constraints and
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
challenges in front of us our schools
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
are are experiencing different
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
challenges our Workforce is experiencing
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
different challenges all slightly change
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
from when we originally you know first
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
started drawing that circle with those
 
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
five tiers the other reason we're
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
interested in in thinking about a path
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
forward and looking at sort of a system
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
of care 2.0 is really the timing um
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to start where're we hope to
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
have a contract in place in July um and
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
you can probably put that together in
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
your own mind why this fall this summer
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
in the fall is particularly critical to
 
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
us because it's really as we're starting
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
to tee up what we need in terms of
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
budget and policy requests for the new
 
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
bium so we are prepared uh we're working
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
on entering into an agreement with the
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
University of Connecticut to conduct an
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
assessment these experts at the
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
University of Connecticut have helped
 
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and many other states work
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
through their own challenges in creating
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive system of care they are
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
going to be tasked with learning what's
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
working what needs Improvement um
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
hearing from policy makers hearing from
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
Community Based agencies hearing from
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
families also to understand what's
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
working what's not working and together
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
with DHHS and all of these Partners
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to develop some
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations priorities and an and
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
what the implementation steps are that
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
will align with our fundamental visions
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
and goals around system of care so by
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
2025 we hope we're going to take those
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
initial findings to design and maybe
 
00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:10.839 align:start position:0%
redesign the infrastructure the people
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
processes places technology policies all
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
of those things that we would need to
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
implement to to create any system design
 
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations and new ways potentially
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
to contract with vendors um
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities for new policy
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities for new financing
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
strategies the financing piece is really
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
important to all of us it's of
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
considerable interest to me in my role
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
and um I think as we enter this new bium
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
that bium and that budget is going to
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
require some hard decisions and some
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility on behalf of all
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
of us and so we need to spend some time
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
about looking how does how will our
 
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
system fit within those parameters so um
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
we have an exciting year ahead of us um
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
I hope that you will help us as we go
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
through this assessment I think it takes
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
some continued intention and attention
 
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
to mature and evolve this system uh we
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
have a really great dedicated State
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
staff and we have leaders and we have
 
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
great policy Advocates and partners in
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
the community who have put in long hours
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
and and I know that we can count on them
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
to grow and adapt as we move forward um
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
we're really lucky to have them and
 
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
we're lucky to have all of you who also
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
help us go through those and guide us
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
through that process so you know I will
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
close out by saying that there are
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
thousands of children that are depending
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
on us to get this right um and so I look
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
forward to all of our continued
 
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
partnership and doing that as we work
 
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
through these new assessments I'm very
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
glad we have a representative of finance
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
committee with us today because you're
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
making your your wish list which becomes
 
00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
my wish list too my question is that I
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
see an overlap here between children and
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
family law and Health and Human Services
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh coincidentally I overlap
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
that too and um if there is
 
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that you think you might
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
need to be filed this fall please link
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
up those who are interested uh I don't
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
write bills um as you know which is a
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
good thing but I hope bills along and uh
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
if there are people that any of us would
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
be interested in working with um uh
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
please let us know because we'd like to
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
throw our weight behind it thank you
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much we absolutely need and
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
and appreciate all of the partnership
 
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
that we've had with all of our policy
 
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
makers I think you speak to the trifecta
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
of Finance child and family law and HHS
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
you know those are the the Committees
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
that we work most closely with and our
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
job this summer is to do the homework
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
and do the assessment so that we can
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
come back with plans that make sense
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any further
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chairman um I don't
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
know I'm trying to form a question here
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
um I I love what you're doing I I I love
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
um uh because well I love it because we
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
have a big need in families today and I
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
was just talking to representative
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant in the hallway about um I'm not
 
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
running next time and so what are you
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
going to do and um and so somebody like
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
me who's not going to be a legislator
 
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
and writing bills to help you out how
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
can somebody like myself help your
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
organization that is a great question I
 
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if Deputy Commissioner wants
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
to be thinking about that as well but I
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
I'll start and and look forward to you
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
to add in you know I I think there are a
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
number of Our Community Partners that
 
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
need um Advocates and supporters whether
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
those that are provide those
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
preventative levels of care those home
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
visi those programs Our Family Resource
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
Centers our um and then all the way up
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
through our community mental health
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
centers need more active volunteers and
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
supporters within there folks that
 
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
understand the issue I think even just
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
translating for your friends in your
 
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
community what this is about and why
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
there is a need I think all of us have a
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
mental model or a sort of a narrative
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
around kids these days and I think it's
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
much more complex and we need everyone
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to speak to that um to be
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
able to speak to the needs and the fact
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
that there's hope that this isn't a lost
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
cause that we have a system of care it's
 
00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
important it's important to have an
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
acute Hospital psychiatric hospital but
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
the reason to have that is so that we
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
can put Youth and families onto a path
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
of healing and hope and and really
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
optimism and reintegration within their
 
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
community so that's a big wide answer
 
00:38:56.109 --> 00:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
it's not a specific ask I don't know
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
depy if you I mean I think I would just
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
add that it seems like in today's um
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
political politically divis divisive
 
00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:05.079 align:start position:0%
climate that U mental health and youth
 
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
mental health remains one of these
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
unicorns of areas of bipartisan
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan engagement and I think it's
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
really important that we protect that
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
Common Ground space of saying right now
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
this is an area that almost every
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
legislator can get behind and I think
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
how do we use that salience to move a
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
little bit beyond as you heard um the
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
ass commissioner describ you know
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
facilities and programs into real
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
systems change which um cost money
 
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
requires um going against the status quo
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that type of the political
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
Savvy that you've Acquired and the
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
ability to engage in common ground um
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
work will serve us all well so thanks
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
for that offer though I would say to the
 
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
representative that in previous editions
 
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
of the House calendar there has been an
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
announcement about how uh at a county
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
level at a state level there are all of
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
these different boards that a person
 
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
could volunteer for that would be one
 
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
thing to look at secondly as I looked
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
over the Secretary of State's list of
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
who has signed up to run there were
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
several people who vowed I will never do
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
it again and took a term out and the
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
wife said yes you will and so we may see
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
see anything else
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%

hi I'm maryan barter I'm the chair of
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire childcare advisory
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
Council so thank you for um thank you
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
for your leadership and thank you for
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
having us here
 
00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
today the childcare advisory oh and this
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
is the handout we're looking at is it
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
yes good looks like this this hand
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
that's the last page but
 
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
yes it looks like this on the front
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
page so the childcare advisory council
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
is a legislatively enacted group that
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
exists really to to advise on the
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
affordability and the accessibility of
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
childcare in New Hampshire so that's our
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
lens we're of course concerned about
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
things like the quality of child care um
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
you know whether parents are getting
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
their needs met all of those things are
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
really really important to us but our
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
priority and the lens that we use is
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
accessibility and affordability and the
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
work that we've done has really been to
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
with those guiding principles to ensure
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we have a steady supply of child
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
care that meets the needs of children
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of parents in New
 
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so our work for the last year
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
has been primarily regulatory so one of
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
the burdens that that one of the things
 
00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
we realized that was keeping people from
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
being entering the child care field
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
staying in the child care field were
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
things like confusion around regulations
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
confusion around um zoning and um
 
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
different fire codes for different towns
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
things like that so a lot of the work
 
00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
that we've done for the last year has
 
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
been around addressing those issues and
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
seeing if we can make it easier for
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
child providers to function in the state
 
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
we work closely with um the child care
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
licensing unit to um they actually
 
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
reached out to us and we developed a
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
workg group to go through the child care
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
licensing regulations line by line to
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
see if we could not weaken them but at
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
least streamline them get them to the
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
point where um they were not over a 100
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
pages long they were not I mean we're
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
humans doing tasks remembering a 100
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
pages of regulations is going to be very
 
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
very difficult but we went through to
 
00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
kind of streamline them to look at
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
things that were in rule but maybe
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
should just be in policy that um if a
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
center has a procedure for handling
 
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
something well maybe licensing doesn't
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
really have to have a rule around that
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
they just need to know that you have a
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
procedure for handling it we've just
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
completed that work it took slightly
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
over a year and very soon that'll be
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
going out for public comment we also
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
engaged heavily with um the special
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
committee on child care there was a
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative from the childcare
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
advisory council at every one of those
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
meetings to ensure that the legisl that
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
was being considered in the state was
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
something that's functioning for the
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
field and I will say one of the things
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
we take most seriously is that we do
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
speak for the field we hear from
 
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
providers every day we hear their
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
struggles we hear their triumphs and we
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
really want to make sure that their
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
stories are Amplified and and that
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
people in the state understand the
 
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
challenges and successes that that um
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
you have providers are facing we also
 
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:54.559 align:start position:0%
worked very closely with DHHS and our
 
00:43:57.549 --> 00:43:57.559 align:start position:0%
partner Jesse Davis to implement
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
the um increased Child Care um um income
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
eligibility and so when
 
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
dhj announced that the eligibility for
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
child care scholarship was going to
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
increase and include many more families
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
um childcare advisory Council started
 
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
talking to Providers saying that's great
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
for families that's wonderful that
 
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to have child care more
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
affordable for their families but how do
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
we get you engaged with the process how
 
00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
do we convince the provider that yes
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
you'll have to bill and yes it'll be a
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
little bit challenging but here's why
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
you should do that that was sort of our
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
work on this process and um it's been an
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
incredible year for the first time ever
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
we were awarded by the couch Foundation
 
00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:41.079 align:start position:0%
enough funds to actually hire a director
 
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
and we've never had that before but
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
because we were asked to do so many
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
things it really helped kind of elevate
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
our work and make it possible for us to
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
take on some of these projects that were
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
really truly time consuming the rest of
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
the committee is really volunteer we're
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're stakeholders we're child I mean I
 
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
run a Child Care Agency um we are people
 
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
anything I don't really have much to add
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
other than I think that the work that
 
00:45:14.829 --> 00:45:14.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to be doing this year to um
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
strengthen the current systems we have
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
and make it easier for families to um
 
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
become enrolled in scholarship and
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
easier for programs to engage in the
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship program is a priority goal
 
00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:31.430 align:start position:0%
scholarship program is a priority goal
for

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
US Representative
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
thank you taking the
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
question can you speak
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
to trying to create a more Dynamic
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
private public partnership in other
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
words when I look on page five and
 
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
looking at what's there for the return
 
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
investment I don't think it should fall
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
completely on the state the
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
business Community industrial Community
 
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
Bia if you will has a tremendous amount
 
00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
to gain by this so where are they in
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
teaming up with you folks on trying to
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's money put into the
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
system to help health uh child care
 
00:46:16.549 --> 00:46:16.559 align:start position:0%
workers in the agencies do their job
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
because ultimately if you don't have
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
workers you don't have a job and you
 
00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
don't have a business so there is some
 
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
logic to trying to team up with the
 
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
business Community as well as with the
 
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
state so where are we with a public
 
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
private partnership So currently um we
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
are engaging in business roundtables all
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
across the state to identify partners
 
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
and um the the new state plan calls out
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
these public private Partnerships and so
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
we will be exploring that um and
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
identifying those partners and those
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
communities who are willing to braid and
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
blend funds to solve this problem
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
actually follow up I'm sorry could I
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
speak to that sure so the childcare
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
advisory council is actually our biggest
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
concern is the amount of wages that
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
child care workers make they're low
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
they're lower than every other area in
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
New England um if you looked at a chart
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
we would be this glowing sort of
 
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
horrible statistic in the middle of it
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
and I completely agree with you and the
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
childcare advisory Council completely
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
agrees with you that child care has been
 
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
Pro been providing an unpaid benefit to
 
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
the business community for decades and
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely time for us to look at
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
our business partners and say we're in
 
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
this together how can you support us and
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
we actually do have a very concrete plan
 
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
that we're hoping to introduce as
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
legislation this fall to support to
 
00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
create a fund to support the Child Care
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
Community specifically through wages and
 
00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
benefits um I'm afraid Jesse does not
 
00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
know very much about this plan it's
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
still in its implementation plan on
 
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.589 align:start position:0%
still in its implementation plan on
stage

00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
stage
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
but you know we've passed a lot of
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
legislation that helps child care you
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
know it's a little bit here and it's a
 
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
little bit there but when we look at the
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
real problem can people afford to do
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
this work can people raise their
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
families while doing this work the real
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
problem comes down to the money in the
 
00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:15.559 align:start position:0%
pocket of providers and so how do we
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
look at that as a Statewide problem and
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
how do we look at that with our business
 
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
Community saying yes when I hire someone
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
you get to hire eight people and that is
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
a huge benefit to you so how do you
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
support my hiring someone and we we
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely do have a
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
plan the
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
other concern I have is how we sort of
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
balance child safety with portability
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get to is that we
 
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
need a certain amount of regulations to
 
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
protect the child but not so much that
 
00:48:50.829 --> 00:48:50.839 align:start position:0%
we kill the business so therefore how do
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
we balance that between being sure the
 
00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
child's safe but not so honorous on the
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory side that it becomes very
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
expensive for somebody who wants to run
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
a child care facility to comply with all
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
the rules and regulations we put in
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
there because it's just onerous and it
 
00:49:09.789 --> 00:49:09.799 align:start position:0%
also gets to the point where the more
 
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
regulation in my opinion that you have
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
the more you squeeze out M and PAW
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the resources to
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
comply and deal with all the regulatory
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
issues 100 page document if you Mom and
 
00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:23.799 align:start position:0%
P you're not going to go through it so
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
therefore you eliminate that out
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
completely out of the marketplace so how
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
do we balance child safety with
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
affordability and what can we do on the
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
regulatory side to help you folks
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
minimize the regulations that we think
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
we don't need but still need to have
 
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
child so I think our work with child
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
care licensing is really addressing this
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
so the work group that the childcare
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
advisory Council was able to put
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
together was actually providers
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
childcare providers there were
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
representatives from every region in the
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
state and there were representatives
 
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
from every type of child care that's not
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
true licensed child care that's
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
available in the states we had after
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
school programs we had family providers
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
we had Center providers so it really was
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
a very comprehensive group and we did go
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
through this line by line I completely
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
agree with you having 100 pages of
 
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.829 align:start position:0%
agree with you having 100 pages of
regulations

00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
although I understand child safety and
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
how important it is it's discouraging
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
right you open this up and you're like
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
why on Earth would I do this to myself
 
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
um the childcare advisory Council has
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
been in talks with the um Community
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
Development Finance Authority to create
 
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
a document that would pull out the
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
family child care regulations so they
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
would have a much shorter document and
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
that was a little bit more um easily
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
understood and easily digestable and
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
then the center base so basically
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
dividing the the book we've not received
 
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
permission to do that yet but that is
 
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
part of our plan moving forward there's
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
no reason why a family provider needs to
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
know how to run an after school program
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
but so help me understand
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
what's in rules that create the issue
 
00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
versus what's in statute statute the
 
00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
department has have any choice to comply
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
with if it's a rule interpretation of
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
the statute is that part of what we need
 
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with on the legislative side
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
because if there are statutes that are
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
in play that are causing concerns for
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
the Department either in the
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
interpretation of and so forth then I
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
think Mr chairman legislatively we
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
should understand what those statutes
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
are and start to deal with it from the
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
leg set of side of the equation it's
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
primarily rule so there are a few
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
statutes but really in general Child
 
00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
Care is implemented through rule I will
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
say we have a couple of things that are
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
really issues zoning and fire
 
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
regulations so an example of this would
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
be there's not any family child care in
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
conquered because of the zoning issues
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
and because of the fire regulations so
 
00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at something like
 
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at a place like
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
conquer where I run an agency that has a
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
weight list that's over 200 children
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
long you know Child Care could
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
definitely lessen the burden for people
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
and how do we how do we address child
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
safety that we're worried about fire I
 
00:52:04.589 --> 00:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
mean we're worried about fire
 
00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:05.799 align:start position:0%
inspections we're worried about all of
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
families just
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
King yeah I guess I guess I guess this
 
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
is uh along the same lines as what
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant was talking
 
00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
about and it was actually brought up in
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
the debate last night although I don't
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
know if anybody either one of them
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
actually addressed this but um the
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
workforce is is short
 
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
people and what I hear from a lot of
 
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
people is uh is one of the spouses is
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
staying home because it's actually
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
cheaper to stay home and not go um go go
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
to work and then have to pay and make
 
00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
just a few dollars more than what
 
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
they're actually paying and so I I
 
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
couple that with one of your statements
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
that wages is one one of the
 
00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.430 align:start position:0%
that wages is one one of the
reasons

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
but knowing how business works and uh
 
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
supply and demand when you have a long
 
00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
list of kids on a list and only a few
 
00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.030 align:start position:0%
list of kids on a list and only a few
Supply

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
Supply
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh suppliers or
 
00:53:32.589 --> 00:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
providers then you can end up jacking
 
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
the rates up and uh and it just seems
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
like we need to figure out how to get
 
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
more of these um uh child care providers
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
out there and and I I think back to when
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
my kids were small and I wanted my wife
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
to stay home with the kids we she
 
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
actually took kids in so I don't know if
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's a way of promoting grassroot
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
systems like that can you speak to that
 
00:54:01.789 --> 00:54:01.799 align:start position:0%
sure I know the DHHS is also committed
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
to doing this work but childcare
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
advisory Council understands and truly
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
respects the the place that family child
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
care has in the child care ecosystem in
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
the state so it is really important and
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why we have such a
 
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
crisis in child care right now is
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
because so many family child care
 
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
programs have closed either because
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
zoning or Fire or the death of a
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
thousand paper cuts so absolutely that
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
is completely true um Child Care is
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily expensive I can use as
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
an example my own agency um so I spend
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
about 70% of our income on labor that
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
leaves 30% for insurance which is
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
incredibly expensive you know and
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
everything else that it takes to I mean
 
00:54:47.549 --> 00:54:47.559 align:start position:0%
right this second I'm sure one of our
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
toilets is clogged right so all of that
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
stuff is extraordinarily expensive so it
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
is a really labor intensive industry and
 
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
it's just not going to get less
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
expensive so it's really I think for the
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
childcare advisory Council what our
 
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
concern is how do we invest wisely we
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
have limited funds right so ccdf has
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
limited funds the state has limited
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
funds so how do we invest these in the
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
smartest way possible to ensure that we
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
get the biggest bang for our buck and um
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
I think when you invest in people and
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
people who do the work that's the best
 
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's always going to be your best
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
investment representative King
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated something I was going to ask
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
let's say Mrs Smith for whatever reason
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
decides to stay home with her little one
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
but her cousin has a little one and
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
their friend from church has a little
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
one so now you have three little ones
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
staying over what could go wrong with
 
00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
this well there are a few things that
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
could go wrong with this and I would
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
neither want the state to come in with
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
onerous regulations that would shut this
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
down or totally ignore the situ
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
situation in case there are genuine
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
Hazard some of which could be remediated
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
or this is not a fit person to have
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
other children in the home maybe not
 
00:56:08.349 --> 00:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
even her own where is The Sweet Spot
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
there sure well for three children you
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
would not need a light to be licensed so
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
the state would not be coming in unless
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
you received Child Care development
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
funds in which case you would be visited
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
by the state um unfortunately when
 
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about family child care
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
home the parents not unfortunately
 
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
regardless of the situation the parent
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
gets to decide who is the safest and
 
00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
most appropriate caregiver for their
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
child right this is their baby they have
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of philosophies about how they
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
want their child raised they get to
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
choose who is the right caregiver
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sometimes that is someone
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
that the rest of us on the planet think
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
would be inappropriate but the break
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
spot is three the break the break spot
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
is now four if the governor signs at the
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
break spot will be
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
four irrespective of whether the other
 
00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
three sets of parents individual parents
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
pay money or not correct so it would be
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
three children right now it's three
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
children who are not your own if soon it
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
will be four children who are not your
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
own so if I had a child I could take in
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
three other children and not be licensed
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
by the the parents of those other
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
children would be The Regulators in
 
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
effect they would be The Regulators good
 
00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:18.910 align:start position:0%
effect they would be The Regulators good
thank

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant thank you
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
clarification on the number of children
 
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
that are not own is there a limit on the
 
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
number of children you have that are are
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
your own that are your own yes so um we
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
my agency also sponsors something called
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
a CH child and adult care food program
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
and it it's kind of like school lunch um
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
we have a license exempt provider who
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
has three of her own children and cares
 
00:57:46.589 --> 00:57:46.599 align:start position:0%
for three Community children so in her
 
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
program she has six children she's
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
operating legally three of them are her
 
00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:51.799 align:start position:0%
own through your community so the
 
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:53.559 align:start position:0%
question is there a limit on the number
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
of children you can have that are your
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
own no I think you could have 47 of your
 
00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
own children and as long as you only
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
have three Community children you are
 
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:03.039 align:start position:0%
licensed exemp it's the number of
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
children that are not your own that's
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
limitation corre okay thank you okay
 
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
then you need a consult from the mental
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
health department got commissioner T
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
Tilly steps in at that point but
 
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
yes anyone
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
else thank you so much for your
 
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:26.230 align:start position:0%
else thank you so much for your
presentation

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:26.240 align:start position:0%

Partners so um New England College back
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
in the um early spring of 2021 did a
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
listening tour of New Hampshire
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals to try to understand a little
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
bit about the needs of our HealthCare
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
Partners in the region and learned um
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
about the nursing shortage and um the
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
exacerbation that was the nursing
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
shortage being exacerbated by the
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um pandemic at the time I have
 
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
been a nurse for 24 years I was um an
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
academics the last 10 in a various in
 
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.920 align:start position:0%

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
um I was asked by New England College to
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
consult on this idea about a Cooperative
 
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
education model in nursing um this model
 
01:00:26.029 --> 01:00:26.039 align:start position:0%
has been used in the past um and in my
 
01:00:27.549 --> 01:00:27.559 align:start position:0%
experience from the institution I used
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
to work at in Resort and Hospitality
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
management where business students
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
worked and um learned and um um um lived
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
all at this Resort in Vermont and so the
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
idea behind it was that students would
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
go into this Resort and they'd work in
 
01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
all capacities and they would have their
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
instructors come to um the resort and
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
teach them and then of course they lived
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
there it was their residence and so um I
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
was asked to think about Nursing
 
01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:03.559 align:start position:0%
education everything I knew and then
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
sort of everything that I have ever
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
wanted um and if I could create
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
something U really Innovative what would
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
that look like and so I thought about it
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
for a little while and um you know
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
there's not enough room in our hospitals
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
right now for our patients so you know
 
01:01:22.109 --> 01:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
obviously our students can't live there
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
um really conference room space is a
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
little bit tight so we really can't send
 
01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:28.839 align:start position:0%
our instructors there but the one thing
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
that we could really impact was
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
providing students with an authentic
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
experience in clinical and so what does
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
it really look like to be a registered
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
nurse how do I really um what are the
 
01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
things I need to know the things I need
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
to do um the pillars of this program as
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
I was um I really had a blank slate and
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
sort of a Blank Stare on my face really
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
on July 12th 2021 thinking okay I really
 
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
need to figure this out um fortunately
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
for me on July I don't know 14th I um we
 
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
had an inaugural partner in conquered
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
hospital so I came to New Hampshire I
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
met with the team and we started working
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
on this together and so through this
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
process have been able to establish what
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
we'd like to call a designated education
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
partnership and so we are truly sharing
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
in the responsibility of educ ating our
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
future nursing Workforce and what does
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
that look like and so we are using the
 
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
earn as youlearn model where students
 
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
work um part of their education they
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
actually spend 30% of their education
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
immersed in a clinical setting in our
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
Hospital Partners throughout New
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they um earn money as an LNA
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
and also earn academic credit through
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
that process they spend um one clinical
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
shift a week during each Cooperative
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
experience working oneon-one with
 
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital partner um registered nurses
 
01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
who are staff um NEC provides those
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
preceptors with an education um so they
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
essentially come from a preceptor
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
perspective where they would normally be
 
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
working with um new graduates or with
 
01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
new employees um orienting them to the
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
hospital to now clinical teachers so we
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
spend the time with them in the very
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
beginning to help educate them on how to
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
work with our nursing students and in
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
conjunction with that they're also they
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
have a clinical faculty member who is
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
there on site during each of their RN
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
precepted shifts to help support not
 
01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
just the students education but to also
 
01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
help support the preceptor because we'd
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
like to call this a preceptor student
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
team a care team and so what this looks
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
like is um very similar to to what
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
diploma programs used to look like um
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
where it's an internship practicum type
 
01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:04.839 align:start position:0%
model but instead of having that resered
 
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
to the end of the program it's right
 
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
from the very beginning and so so I was
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the pillars and so the
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
nursing Workforce shortage is really
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
where I was leading from and I wanted to
 
01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
be able to impact that in several ways
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
and the very first way was providing the
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals with LNA support year round
 
01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:29.799 align:start position:0%
because without them care would not be
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
able to happen in hospitals and there
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
was such a big um need for them and so
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
that became part of our
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
program the other way that I really
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to impact um the nursing shortage
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire was instead of in a
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
traditional nursing model where nursing
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
students will um spend some of their
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
clinical time let's say at conquered
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital they'll spend some time at um
 
01:04:59.549 --> 01:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
Portsmith or Parkland or name you know
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
insert Hospital name and they move
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
around a lot in their clinical practice
 
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
and they don't necessarily get a sense
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
of Jesus might be where I want to work
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough time to really
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
experience the system and so in our
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
model our students are immersed in one
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hospital partner site for three years
 
01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
and so right from the very beginning
 
01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
they are LNA employees at our Hospital
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
partner as hospital employees part of
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
the benefit is that academic um work
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
time goes towards their academic credit
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
and they're there for three years and so
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
they get to experience different they
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
have three years vested when they
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
graduate they're part of the choosing of
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
where do I maybe want to work we get
 
01:05:47.549 --> 01:05:47.559 align:start position:0%
very strategic around this student lives
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
in this sort of um demographic area so
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
maybe they want to work at conquered
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
Hospital maybe we should put them at
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
Port Smith so that because they live
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
down by the Sea Coast and we want them
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
to stay in New Hampshire that was really
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
The Hope um the other way to impact this
 
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
is by by the nursing shortage is by
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
giving them a truly authentic experience
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
throughout their Nursing education in
 
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
that transition to practice right after
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
they graduate in that first year we lose
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
between I think it's 30 and 37% of
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
nurses in that first year of practice
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
because they don't know what it is
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
actually like to be a nurse until they
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
get into practice and do it and they're
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
like I didn't sign up for this well
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's good and bad right so but now it
 
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
happens sort of at the beginning of our
 
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
program so we've had to build in some
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
supports for them and it also tells them
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
right away is this something that I
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
really want to spend three years or and
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
it helps us offset them to another area
 
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
that they might want to work so it it
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
it's um hopefully preserving that in
 
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
that on that end but it's also a
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
professional develop M opportunity for
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
the preceptors so in partnership with
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
the hospitals providing preceptors with
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
that additional
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
education so that they can provide
 
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
students with a really good experience
 
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
but it will perpetuate hopefully that
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
preceptor mentality and those preceptors
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
will precept again our students will
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
precept and precept again and then we'll
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
be able to hopefully move a model
 
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
similar to this out to other schools of
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
Nursing in the state because everybody
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
right now um I was fortunate in
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
developing this program at a perfect
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
time I was developing this program when
 
01:07:40.109 --> 01:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
all of the standards were changing and I
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
could go with the most up toate
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
standards and um sort of philosophies
 
01:07:48.269 --> 01:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
around accreditation and um the Board of
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
Nursing has done a lot of innovative
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
things since I've come to New Hampshire
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
not because of me but it's just I'm a
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
lucky timing um
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
and so other programs in other schools
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
of nursing are all wonderful and we do
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
have a great um Nursing education um
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire but everybody is
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
changing to this new system they have
 
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
they're starting to have to change their
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum and move into these
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
directions and so we're hoping to really
 
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
grow this into not just um an NEC thing
 
01:08:27.309 --> 01:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
but a New Hampshire nurs in thing um
 
01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
similar to the board of nursing right
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
now um there's a pilot study that um
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
we're working through um at Portsmith
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
Hospital the exter nurse externship
 
01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
program which would be great if we could
 
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
make that a permanent um thing so that
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
it can be implemented at other hospitals
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
not just in one area um so I asked Emily
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
to come because um working with her for
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
the last 3 years um we have some um
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
results um from our first cohort of
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
students and some of the impacts that
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
this has had on conquered hospital um in
 
01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
general so I'll just turn this over to
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
you uh so some of the key results of our
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
program in our first class we had a
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
reduction and sorry for the small font
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
on your papers but um so we had a
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
reduction in LNA Staffing vacancy rates
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
from 20.8 FTE deficit it to 5.8 um we
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
also had 71% of them stay on as per DM
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
through their dactic semester so they
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
were still working and contributing to
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
the LNA Workforce at conquered hospital
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
and we also surveyed our preceptors and
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
it we had really positive results and I
 
01:09:45.309 --> 01:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
think um giving back to the profession
 
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
and teaching the students for those who
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
weren't quite ready to like take on a
 
01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
new grad um give satisfaction to our
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
preceptors which will keep them in the
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
field as we know we lost a lot so I'm
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
also a Adjunct professor for nhti and I
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
could see uh partnering with the ccsnh
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
system and their nursing programs I know
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of um students are second time
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
students so maybe they were in
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
Babysitting and now they want to be a
 
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
nurse or what have you um and they tend
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
to stay in New Hampshire so I could see
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
them wanting to work as alanas and stay
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
on perdm and we could like Branch into
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
that Realm um with the ccsnh uh
 
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
community colleges for nursing too
 
01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
but couple things as I shared with you
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
before the meeting um I am chief
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
executive officer of a facility in
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
Kingston that combines family practice
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
medicine counseling and massage and we
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
have people uh both at the um
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
osteopathic physician level and also
 
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
nursing level do rotations with us so
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
I'm keenly interested in this you may be
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
aware that if you go up Huntington
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
Avenue in Boston you'll bump into a
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
facility called
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
Northeastern and they know about
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
Cooperative education yeah it's a
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
wonderful model and secondly you may not
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
know that uh 50 years ago as a young
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
Episcopal Deacon visiting hospitals I
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
could tell you in five minutes who was
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
in a college program versus who was in a
 
01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
old tradition school of nursing program
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
and being the kind of mind I have I
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
often thought why couldn't we have the
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
best of both so you're 50 years in
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
coming but thank you for coming this can
 
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
be wonderful this kind of Cooperative
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
education that um when I was a theology
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
Professor we had with some of our
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
Seminary students on the way to
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
ordination not just three years of
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
academics and now out in the real world
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
but overlapping integrative so I think
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
this is a model that picks up both of
 
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:02.870 align:start position:0%
this is a model that picks up both of
the

01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
Traditions uh and could be variously
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
implemented in many places right um I
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to um Express so last our
 
01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
students began their first Cooperative
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
in the summer term so last summer I
 
01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time at conquered
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
hospital because I wanted to make sure
 
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know you just have to make
 
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
sure that you're what you think is going
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
to be good actually is and it was really
 
01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
interesting to see that our students
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
were the same as any nursing student on
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
their first day of clinical they show up
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
they're terrified they get off the
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
elevator their knees are knocking they
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do with themselves
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
they don't know how to introduce
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
themselves to a patient um they're
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
afraid to like expose anybody to listen
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
to Heart or lungs they're just not quite
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
sure what to do with themselves um and
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
so we work with them through that but I
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
I can honestly say that watching them
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
move from that knee knocking scared to
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
death you know student nurse on the
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
elevator to just week six the learning
 
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
that they have it's what I want them to
 
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
take care of me independently six weeks
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
in no that AB no that's not what I'm
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
saying but what I'm saying is that
 
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.550 align:start position:0%
saying but what I'm saying is that
they're

01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
learning because they are exposed to
 
01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
everything and so like with all of the
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
standards changing we're less focused on
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay I need to do this skill I need to
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
do this skill I need to do this skill
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
they're more focused
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
on watching their preceptor being
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
team C1 do one teach one you know that
 
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a model um giving them a
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
three-year orientation into the
 
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
profession and really nurturing them and
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
looking at it from a systems perspective
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
so rather than eight students with one
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
clinical instructor like in a
 
01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
traditional program on one unit where
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
that clinical instructor has to be at
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
the bedside for every RN scope of
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
practice thing which delays care it
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't give them it delays their time
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
management they are being exposed to
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
something that's not accurate in
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
practice and
 
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
so and you find that you have these
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
clusters of nursing students sort of
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
hanging around not really learning in
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
this model they're connected to the hip
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
of their preceptor if the preceptor is
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
moving they're moving they may not
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
understand initially what they're doing
 
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
but they pick it up really quick and
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
they reflect on their preceptor practice
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
first well 14 weeks they're reflecting
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
on that preceptor practice because they
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
need to start to understand that this
 
01:14:54.629 --> 01:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
was a problem this is what they did this
 
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
is how they fixed it then we
 
01:14:59.709 --> 01:14:59.719 align:start position:0%
re-evaluated and then they start to do
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
it themselves one thing we have learned
 
01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
having had students for 25 years early
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
on one of the students said on the one
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
hand and I like anything that begins
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
with on the one hand because you know
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
there's at least one more hand coming on
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
the one hand there's advantages to doing
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
one month rotations all over the place
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
on the other hand could I come back for
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
two more rotation
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
here because it's after the first
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
rotation you start to go deeper deeper
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
deeper into the place you're at
 
01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're skimming the cream
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
times 6 8 10 12 rather than going in
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
depth times 2 or three so I commend the
 
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
fact that you're not sending them out to
 
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
all kinds of different places for a
 
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:48.679 align:start position:0%
brief tour right so they're doing um
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
acute care initially we want them in
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
that first Co-op to feel warm and cushy
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
and you start to know
 
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
we want them to know where to put your
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
coat where to put your lunch we want
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
them to this is this is the hospital
 
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
this is the cafeteria this is the EMR
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
that we use get them oriented to and
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
have them start to build roots and and
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
then experience something maybe it's not
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
something that they love to experience
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
maybe they're like I want to try
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
something different well that's the
 
01:16:19.229 --> 01:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
systems perspective where the aacn is
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
going is rather than looking at it from
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
a very siloed perspective let's look at
 
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
it from a systems perspective and let's
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
move those students around a system and
 
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
see this in Co-op one student a is in
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
Med surge maybe they're interested in
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
critical care let's give them an
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
experience down in the ICU and that's
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
part of Emily's job is to move them
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
around the hospital and work with them
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
to sort of say where in the end do you
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
see yourself working Hospital One
 
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
hospital system okay right right so
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
we've had students where have we had
 
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
student community so and for Cooperative
 
01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
tool we actually had them um go to all
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
the different uh units that were
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
participating as well as go to the
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
community so they went to a primary care
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
and a Specialty Care office to see um is
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
that for them and we actually put them
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
in the Ed for an ed observation they did
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
an O um Cooperative three they're going
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
to do maternity and PD and then I'm also
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
going to put them in ICU so they can see
 
01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
that as well and one of the things that
 
01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
I'm really excited about so the the
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
cohort our first cohort is going to
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
graduate next spring and I anticipate
 
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
their orientation to be like super short
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
and even our nurse Regency program
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
they're not going to need it all so they
 
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
because they've been so uh immersed in
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
the conquered Hospital culture they're
 
01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
not going to need to know our Falls you
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
know precautions and all the things that
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
they've been doing for three years so
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to you're looking forward
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
to the day when one of the graduates now
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
becomes a mentor of the next group
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
aren't we actually have an LNA who um we
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
did an an LNA program our first round
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
which uh we actually do have an LNA
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program at conquered
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
hospital that we're trying to get going
 
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
because we do need lnas in the field um
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
and we ended up um she she was brand new
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
LNA and she's precepting one of the
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
students and she is so excited and
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
they're doing great together and it's
 
01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
like support on both ends because she
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
can say oh I I'm in the program too and
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
how can I help you in that way it's
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
building you know a lot of mentors in
 
01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
the in the organization of the things I
 
01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
learned from my training and
 
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
counseling is secondary trauma and when
 
01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
we get people doing a rotation with us I
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
Shadow them because that new student
 
01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
especially if this is his or her first
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
out rotation especially will go into a
 
01:18:46.669 --> 01:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
room and that first patient will have a
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
terminal illness that her grandmother
 
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
has and you have to be professional but
 
01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
you can't so defense against what's
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
going on in you you become cold and
 
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
clinical what do you do you don't have
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
time to figure out what to do because
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
now your 9:30 is here who is got this
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
situation which your cousin has and by
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
the end of the day you're a wreck so
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
what do you do I debrief them how do you
 
01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.470 align:start position:0%
what do you do I debrief them how do you
handle

01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
handle
 
01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
that so I was going to say that um some
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
of the interesting things that I saw
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
last summer with our students is those
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
again knee knee knocking the very
 
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
beginning and in a traditional program
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
when I was a clinical instructor and if
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
there was a code that was going on and
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
the team was working on them I would
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
stand outside the room with my student
 
01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
just so that they were out of the way
 
01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
and I would say and I would explain what
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
was going on in the room and they were
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
sort of stepped back this past
 
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
summer there was an alert overhead I I
 
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
knew it was the students room I knowing
 
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
it was the one knee knocking on the
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
elevator at the beginning I said oh I
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
better go up there because she's going
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
to need support she was in the room it
 
01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
was her patient um it was somebody who
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
was having a stroke and she identified
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
the stroke she got her preceptor she got
 
01:20:07.629 --> 01:20:07.639 align:start position:0%
this she went to the with the patient
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
down to CT she went with the patient out
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
to the helicopter because patient had to
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
be flown to Boston um and then we talked
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
about it afterwards great job and then
 
01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
that same student was in a situation
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
where she was because she was in her LNA
 
01:20:25.229 --> 01:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
role um
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
and even in their preceptor their are in
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
precepted roles were're helping in um
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
CPR doing chest compressions and doing
 
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
the switch where in a lot of cases
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
nursing students would not be a part of
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
that but because they feel so
 
01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
comfortable and the team that they're
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
with and so comfortable with their
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
preceptors they're actually a part of
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
the care that takes place on a
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis you're talking now
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
about the professional actions of the
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
person I'm talking about their inner
 
01:20:54.239 --> 01:20:55.510 align:start position:0%
person I'm talking about their inner
situ

01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
situ
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
being present y so that um that person
 
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
after I found out about the CPR CU I our
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
clinical faculty who are in the clinical
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
faculty site say hey we had this student
 
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
she had this experience I gave her my
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
phone number I told her to give me a
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
call if she needed to it was 9:00 at
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
night I reached out to her and I said if
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
you need to talk about this let's talk
 
01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:19.719 align:start position:0%
about it I saw her again the other part
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
of our partnership that is really really
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
um wonderful is that because we are
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
connected and um have this dual
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility and accountability for
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
these students who are also their
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
employees they have support from the
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
wellness center at the college but also
 
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
the EAP program at the hospital they
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
have support from the dean they have the
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
support from the academic practice
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
partner who is also their supervisor as
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
an LNA they have support from their
 
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues from their CCF from their um
 
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
classroom faculty their advisors so we
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
do follow up with them in those
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
situations to help support them through
 
01:21:59.070 --> 01:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
like I said the transition shock happens
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
in that first term in that first
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
clinical term so we have these
 
01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
Protections in place to try to help them
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
navigate through that so that we can
 
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
keep them moving forward in the program
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
so that we can get them on the other end
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
to graduate so that they can then be
 
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
there will be a lessened um transition
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
shock when they're independent on their
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
own after graduation I'm so glad to hear
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
that because I regularly get the comment
 
01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
from our people rotating through we were
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
the only facility that has ever done
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
this with them others will comment on
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
what they did
 
01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
professionally I'm the one who talks to
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
them about your response and triggers
 
01:22:43.229 --> 01:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
and family and that uh I wish more
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
places would do that rotational size but
 
01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:47.719 align:start position:0%
that's just an as side any questions
 
01:22:47.719 --> 01:22:51.030 align:start position:0%
that's just an as side any questions
representative

01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
on a personal note I have a tremendous
 
01:22:57.629 --> 01:22:57.639 align:start position:0%
amount of respect for the nursing
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
profession you folks are really the
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
backbone of our Health Care system and
 
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
without you folks who wouldn't exist
 
01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:04.870 align:start position:0%
without you folks who wouldn't exist
thank

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
you one of the things I look for is the
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
progression from an LNA to an
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
RN why stop at the LNA why not allow
 
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
them to become an LPN and reason for
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
that being is once they become an LPN
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
they start getting a certain sense of
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
some Independence not completely they
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
have to work under the RN course and the
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
care plan but they can do things that
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
they can't do as an LNA they can start
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
giving if you will possibly IV drugs
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
they can start doing certain things of
 
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
that capacity it starts helping them on
 
01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
that journey to Independence so it's a
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
mid-step between an LNA in a full our
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
end and still allows them to have that
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
progression through the professional
 
01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
years because acquiring the knowledge is
 
01:23:50.910 --> 01:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
one thing utilization of it in my
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
opinion is what make the makes them the
 
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
professional right so when an academic
 
01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
MC um perspective I agree that that's an
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
important that could be an important
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
step to getting to the RN but from an um
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
practice side of it so in the hospital
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have LPN we do have them in the
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
outpatient setting um it's it was
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
explored a little bit during covid but
 
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
we we never really gained any traction
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
there um they are doing if they're going
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
for ourn they definitely are
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
participating in those skills it's not
 
01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
independently it's with your preceptor
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
so for example like IV medication you
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
have to have your preceptor or your
 
01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:29.800 align:start position:0%
faculty with you um so they are getting
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
those skills but I think it'd be hard to
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
to find their spot because it would be
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
more um if we were for the conquered
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
hospital system we'd have to put them in
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
the outpatient setting and then they're
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
not getting as much inpatient prep for
 
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
enlex and you you'd have to sit for the
 
01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.109 align:start position:0%
enlex and you you'd have to sit for the
boards

01:24:47.109 --> 01:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
boards
 
01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
too thank you Mr I totally understand
 
01:24:51.870 --> 01:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
that part of it is that if you become
 
01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
the LPN there's no reason why they
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't still work inside the hospitals
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
in LNA and that's really kind of a
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
Hospital's call what I'm also trying to
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
get to is it allows them from a pay
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
scale to earn probably significantly
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
more money than it would as an LNA which
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
will keep them going forward versus when
 
01:25:12.189 --> 01:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
you stay 3 years as an LNA your pay
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
scale is going to be somewhat diminished
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of like when you are a
 
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
physician you graduate become an intern
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
you don't work as an LNA you work as a
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
resident you don't get the same
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
compensation as you would have
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
full-blown position if you will um you
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
know attending if you will or somebody
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
else Fellowship so I'm just one trying
 
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
to get to was the blending of the two
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
together but it sounds like it's an
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
internal policy of the hospital not so
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
much the program yeah I think the
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
speaking for um from the nhdi adun side
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
we don't see a lot of LPNs to RN um they
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
have a program at nhti and it's it's not
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
very popular they don't get too many
 
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
applicants and sometimes they don't even
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
run it CU we do support that as well
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
through the um nhti system um but as far
 
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
as the academic side yeah they do I mean
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
they do get the
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
um they would be able to sit for their
 
01:26:13.390 --> 01:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
LPN um it's just a matter of through
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
that employment part of it their scope
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
of practice if they were working as lnas
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
their scope they would be working scope
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
oftice and their scope of practice would
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
be below their
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
level if they were an
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
LPN okay I'm sure you're tracking you
 
01:26:34.350 --> 01:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
alluded to this
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
um from graduation of an RN to three
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
years out to five years out how many
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
quit and possibly it is because I never
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
knew it involved this going into it I
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
thought it was going to college um I'm
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
going to look forward to your statistics
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
for people who come through your program
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
three years out five years out and I'm
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
going to bet that
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
the leaving the profession rate is
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
significantly lower
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
right yes um there's also retirement
 
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
which is a huge issue um there is uh
 
01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
lack of Faculty like qualified faculty
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
that sort of creates a problem of how
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
many students can we take into our
 
01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
program clinical um site that kind of
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
limits people to how many students they
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
can take um and so there are a lot of
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
different competing things but like I
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
said that first year of practice for new
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
I the statistic is clear in my head um
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
that that 30 to 3 sish depending on what
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
year you're looking at in practice we
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
lost um before covid the vacancy rate in
 
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospitals I believe was
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
12% RNs and it skyrocketed to 22 2% um
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
and that's because H we lost so many
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
nurses during that um transition to burn
 
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
out um and working in a covid um
 
01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
envirment those would be outlier stats
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
to me I would like to see how many
 
01:28:13.229 --> 01:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
people graduate this spring in an RN
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
program where they are in three years
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
versus how many people graduate through
 
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
your kind of program three years out and
 
01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
if there were even follow-up questions
 
01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
as to why did you leave well my husband
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
got sick okay that's not useful here but
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
to say I didn't know it was like this
 
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
that's the gold mine compare contrast
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
give me a great idea for a study well if
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
I wanted to go back and get another
 
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
degree I'm going to take this one up but
 
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to do that any questions
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative King mine isn't a
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
question and thank you Mr chairman any
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
comments representative K I have a
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
comment it's an encouraging comment I I
 
01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
think we need more of this in all
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
Industries um 40 some OD years ago maybe
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
30 uh these this this idea of
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships seemed to just
 
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
disappear and now that um you know the
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
Baby Boomers are starting to retire
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
you've already mentioned that
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
and uh and the the the Millennials are
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
not uh following suit and some of that
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
some of that's just because we don't
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
have the people nurturing and bringing
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
them into the field so I applaud you for
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
what you're doing I want to encourage
 
01:29:35.229 --> 01:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
you that you're on the right track I uh
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
I also applaud you for looking at uh
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
different different solutions to a a
 
01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
severe problem that we have um I was in
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
for a gallbladder surgery two years ago
 
01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
and I had to wait a week for a bed to to
 
01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
become available oh my gosh and um so I
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
know that there's there are desperate
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
issues in the hospital and I think this
 
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
program is going to be something that's
 
01:30:04.109 --> 01:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
that will help and it it's going to take
 
01:30:07.149 --> 01:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
time so be patient thank
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
you and um that everything seems to come
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
full circle so we used to have the
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
conquered Hospital School of Nursing and
 
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
I feel like we're getting back to that
 
01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
where they're so immerse they're ready
 
01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
this is for me um and I can I'm pretty
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
excited to track to see how well these
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
the first cohort and cohorts biano um
 
01:30:29.709 --> 01:30:29.719 align:start position:0%
and we do track the nurse residency
 
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
retainment so I could look up those
 
01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
numbers and this group compared to other
 
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
group will be super interesting to study
 
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
any any hopes of bringing back
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
caps oh I would I'd wear
 
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
one okay we do pin though still so all
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
still night Andale ceremony I mean I
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
have aunts who are nurses from hospital
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
school days yep we had a nurse who just
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
retired last year who wore her cap and
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
um her skirt every every time she worked
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
and she was amazing um amazing nurse for
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
a long time I only say no because it's
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's an
 
01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.350 align:start position:0%
it's an
infection

01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
infection
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
issue representative Merchant thank
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
you can you speak to with
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
nhdi I believe there's a 2-year program
 
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
for RNs blending that into this program
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
because in a lot of ways one of the
 
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
things I think we see with the 2-year
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
program is again back to the bedside
 
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge and so forth this sounds like
 
01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
a great compromise almost going from the
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
four year to the two- year coming in the
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
middle is there any thought within the
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
institutions within New Hampshire
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
because you have one actually in
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
Claremont y that would actually blend
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
the two together and saying you know you
 
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:47.070 align:start position:0%
the two together and saying you know you
could

01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
become you know a BSN within 3 years
 
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
versus going after the As and if you
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
will then going on to the BSN so the um
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
NH does your ADN and they actually
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
partnered with UNH Manchester um it used
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
to be granet and SN they also have SN
 
01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
where the um graduate of the ADN program
 
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
can actually take courses at SN or UNH
 
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester for associates degree prices
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
per credit so it Bridges them and then
 
01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
at conquered um I always try to
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
encourage them to keep going and what's
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
really cool about you got your nursing
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
license you start practicing as an in at
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
the bedside and you can pluck away at
 
01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
your nursing classes to get your BSN
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
because that's a goal of the um I think
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's the American Nurses Association to
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
have everyone eventually get their
 
01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
Bachelors um and we actually offer
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
tuition reimbursement at the hospital
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
and so I'm like just use your tuition
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and keep going and you can
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
work and they'll have more knowledge too
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
and what's really cool um when they're
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
in the field I've had I need a project
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
for My Capstone and oh well I do
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
I was an orthopedic nurse for 17 years
 
01:32:58.669 --> 01:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
before I took this role um and I'm like
 
01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
oh well I have this on the bone program
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
that we run and wanted to help with
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
fractured hips and Fracture prevention
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
and or like we have so many so many
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
projects for for students and it helps
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
our organization at the same time um but
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
we have that and what I would love to
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
see is um similar to how the NEC program
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
is some LNA credit towards your nursing
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
cuz they are
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
you know for the first five weeks of uh
 
01:33:31.109 --> 01:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
adjunct I'm an adjunct at nhci we just
 
01:33:33.109 --> 01:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
are teaching them LNA skills so if they
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
already have their LNA do we let them in
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit later you can uh decrease
 
01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
their tuition um and our LNA
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program like that's
 
01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
another thing that I think five of my
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
LNA Apprentice uh want to go back to
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
school I have a cohort of like 12 right
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
now um and five of them are like how do
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
I become a nurse and I'm like well
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
there's all these different Pathways and
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'd love to like find a way for them to
 
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
see where they can go it's nhdi a better
 
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
option for me is NC a good option for me
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
or um and then we hopefully we'll keep
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
them all of us state legislators are
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
members of our County's delegations and
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
most of us are also assigned to one
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
particular thing guess what I'm on the
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
County Nursing Home supervisory thing
 
01:34:25.629 --> 01:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
and would this program not work in a
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
nursing home as well as a hospital
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps it it could but we need to give
 
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
them experiences it the system P if they
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
were a part of a system for sure like
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
that would make sense for them to have
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
an experience out in the system but for
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
those independent nursing homes those
 
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
experiences would need to they would be
 
01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
limited they wouldn't have the
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to an ICU or to an ed
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
or to um they're not going to experience
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
that same systems perspective um so
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
observation day though but they could
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
have an observation day perhaps to go to
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
a long-term care facility but that would
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
mean that um observation they would not
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
be able to participate in Direct Care
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of practice of an LNA
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
well I tend to think quite widely not
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
very deep usually but widely and this in
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
some permutation might be something to
 
01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
consider is how can we solve the nurses
 
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
lack of thereof in County nursing homes
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
because we had a shut a w or excuse me a
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
unit because we can't staff it right and
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
I made some suggestions about could you
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
not link up with and that was just a
 
01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
liberal arts guy thinking without any
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
specifics you're bringing specifics so
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
can I bring a liberal arts idea that
 
01:35:45.119 --> 01:35:46.750 align:start position:0%
can I bring a liberal arts idea that
maybe

01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
something absolutely absolutely my my
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
pretty Visionary and I would love
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay more um specific guidelines like
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
what is it that you would need what's
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
the scope of the problem um those types
 
01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
of things but for sure like I would love
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
to explore how we can help New Hampshire
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
Healthcare in general um in whatever way
 
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
we can we currently have seven partners
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
and so we have students right now
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the state in different
 
01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
systems who might be connected to a
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
long-term care facility that we might be
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
able to impact in some way just like
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
with the VNA um you know those types of
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
observations hospice um and paliative
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
care and those types of experiences
 
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
there might be some room for that
 
01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
sure it sure yeah that's their Capstone
 
01:36:44.669 --> 01:36:44.679 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant Isn't it nice
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
when it's just we few
 
01:36:46.639 --> 01:36:48.669 align:start position:0%
when it's just we few
we

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:48.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
intimate is there something we can do
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
legislatively to help move this along
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
um a lot of times it comes down to the
 
01:36:57.870 --> 01:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
money or there may be something you have
 
01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
to do in statute I don't think there's
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
anything that I know of within the
 
01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
regulatory body within the Board of
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
Nursing but sometimes comes down to is
 
01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
funding Pilots of funding projects like
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
this you know is there anything we can
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
try to do on the legislative side I know
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
Senator G Ganon put a $300,000 in there
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
for loan repayment um for nurses for
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
Primary Care um so those are the things
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get to is what can we do
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
to help Foster this because we
 
01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
desperately need more nurses right so I
 
01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
can speak from the academic perspective
 
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
and what we might need um New England
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
college is a private nonprofit so for me
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
I would I would be curious if there
 
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
might be some opportunities for
 
01:37:39.589 --> 01:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
scholarship money for students um to
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
come to um NEC to be a part of this
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
program additionally I have been this
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
idea has been in the back of my head for
 
01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
um years I just haven't had time um to
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
do a a Bea Bea nurse camp in the
 
01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
summertime to bring Juniors and seniors
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
from high school to um the college and
 
01:38:02.589 --> 01:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
um provide them with a couple weeks of
 
01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
maybe that first course that first
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
course credit come to
 
01:38:09.629 --> 01:38:09.639 align:start position:0%
NEC move them around the state go to the
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
different hospital Partners start to get
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
to know them explain our model and then
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
at the same time hopefully um get them
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
into the role of the LNA and start
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
moving them forward so potentially there
 
01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
might be some opportunity for funding
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
for that program
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
um and marketing um I have in the past
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
seen when there was a nursing shortage I
 
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
don't even remember how long ago it was
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
but the Johnson and Johnson Foundation
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
did a you know a nursing marketing come
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
into nursing I I have been a New
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident now for three years
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
and I have never and this is this isn't
 
01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
because maybe it isn't there but I have
 
01:38:51.629 --> 01:38:51.639 align:start position:0%
not seen that type of like marketing
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
campaign around being a nurse um stay in
 
01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this is what we have to
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
offer um so that might be something that
 
01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
you know might be
 
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
helpful have you thought about again I
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
talked about this
 
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
before as a profession you folks have a
 
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
foot in the door because there're School
 
01:39:17.589 --> 01:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
nurses how do you engage with a School
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
nurses get to those Juniors and seniors
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
to talk about the profession of nursing
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
because the nurse normally in the school
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
is again a safe trusted individual is
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
how do we engage them to help identify
 
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
or Foster the marketing if you will for
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
the students because coming from that
 
01:39:36.589 --> 01:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
body that individual probably is going
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
to carry a lot of weight with that
 
01:39:41.229 --> 01:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
student right absolutely so um one of
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
the next course that our students are
 
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
taking is cooperative 3 and so in that
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
Cooperative they have the opportunity to
 
01:39:50.669 --> 01:39:50.679 align:start position:0%
go out into the community in different
 
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
ways and it has a um
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh the concepts sort of help them
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
through women's health issues and also
 
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
with Pediatrics and so as part of that
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to have some education
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
around school nursing and what do School
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
nurses do and as soon as we're able to
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
partner with a school system we were in
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
initial talks with Manchester school
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
system to have our students go out into
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
the schools and work with School nurses
 
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
um we didn't have that set up
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily for this co-op in the fall
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
but but that is the plan in the future
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
but in this Co-op they'll have the
 
01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn about school
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
nursing and what school nursing
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
is and conquered Hospital uh has a
 
01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
program um through conquered High the
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
crtc program with Sharon bean and she
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm new to this role so I she'll give
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
me a list of students and where they
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
want to go and what they want to Shadow
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll set them up with different
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
shadows throughout our organization
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
whether it be outpatient ma LNA um
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
doctors nurses and just give them that
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity and I would love to be able
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
to give them more opportunity and
 
01:41:02.669 --> 01:41:02.679 align:start position:0%
there's like a lot of paperwork required
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
um and I'm thinking of like it's
 
01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:07.159 align:start position:0%
probably coming from somewhere maybe in
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
this building I don't know um that we
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
have to like make sure that they have
 
01:41:12.430 --> 01:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
all these things and I think we could if
 
01:41:14.189 --> 01:41:14.199 align:start position:0%
it's hands-off observation we could give
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
them more um hours that we're able to uh
 
01:41:19.629 --> 01:41:19.639 align:start position:0%
set them up with different things to
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
really see what they want to go into and
 
01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:24.679 align:start position:0%
then um another thing we could look at
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
is helping the colleges advertise like
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
you were saying um I know the community
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
colleges are are struggling with getting
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know enrollment and what does it
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
look like and I'd love to get like a
 
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
pathway for each college and these are
 
01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
the different colleges and based on
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
their catchment area or all these
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
different high schools that we're
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
working with here's a brochure about how
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
you can become a nurse and where can you
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
start and how do you get your feet wet
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
being an LNA and ma um and even in
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
cafeteria working and so we have like a
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
lot of different um opportunities cuz
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
we're such a big organization that they
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
could even start in the cafeteria and
 
01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
then what I've been doing is like hey
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
what are you interested in you're 16 go
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
let's set you up with a shadow here or
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
um even it we' have medical building and
 
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
coding students we have a lot of
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
students um that I'm wrapping my head
 
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
around but I I think we could use help
 
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
with that um just as like something to
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
help guide uh younger Generations cuz
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's hard to it's me saying oh there's
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
NEC there's un there's all these schools
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
but I don't have anything that really
 
01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
lays it out for the student what is it
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
going to look like and how much is it
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
going to cost me and what's a good way
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
to go about it do I start as a LNA
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
Apprentice at conquer Hospital which um
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
we actually pay for them to go to school
 
01:42:44.669 --> 01:42:44.679 align:start position:0%
at the hospital um and then they
 
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
contract with us for 2 years but I'm
 
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
like should should it be two years or if
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to school could they drop
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
back to pum um but because it cost so
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
much the hospital's like no we want to
 
01:42:57.149 --> 01:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
be able to make them do it for two years
 
01:42:59.709 --> 01:42:59.719 align:start position:0%
but I'm like I we also want to be have
 
01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
them be a nurse so let's let them go to
 
01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
school and drop back to pum as opposed
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
to staying full-time so we can make them
 
01:43:07.470 --> 01:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
successful and then have them as a nurse
 
01:43:09.589 --> 01:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
later on I'm going to bring this to a
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
close thank you so much if we have any
 
01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
more questions you can stick around for
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
a little while if you have business
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
cards I'll swap
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you and you've all been a
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
great audience and because of that I'm
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
going to give you the summer off and we
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
will reconvene in September although 91a
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
legal conversations may continue all
 
01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:32.189 align:start position:0%
legal conversations may continue all
through

01:43:32.189 --> 01:43:32.199 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
