00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
see so the work is difficult to begin
 

00:40:18.359 --> 00:40:21.390 align:start position:0%
see so the work is difficult to begin
with<00:40:19.359><c> SEC</c><00:40:19.839><c> so</c><00:40:20.200><c> so</c><00:40:20.560><c> I</c><00:40:20.640><c> just</c><00:40:20.800><c> wanted</c><00:40:21.079><c> to</c>

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
with SEC so so I just wanted to
 

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.309 align:start position:0%
with SEC so so I just wanted to

00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that because we are
 

00:40:23.319 --> 00:40:26.950 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that because we are

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.230 align:start position:0%

um<00:40:27.280><c> which</c><00:40:27.480><c> is</c><00:40:27.640><c> a</c><00:40:27.880><c> basis</c><00:40:28.520><c> when</c><00:40:28.680><c> you</c><00:40:28.800><c> look</c><00:40:28.960><c> at</c><00:40:29.119><c> the</c>

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
um which is a basis when you look at the
 

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.950 align:start position:0%
um which is a basis when you look at the
interest<00:40:29.720><c> for</c><00:40:30.040><c> what</c><00:40:30.400><c> processes</c><00:40:31.000><c> then</c><00:40:31.520><c> do</c><00:40:32.960><c> um</c>

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
interest for what processes then do um
 

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.630 align:start position:0%
interest for what processes then do um
and<00:40:34.359><c> that</c><00:40:34.560><c> gets</c><00:40:34.800><c> us</c><00:40:35.000><c> to</c><00:40:35.200><c> this</c><00:40:35.359><c> due</c>

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
and that gets us to this due
 

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:42.870 align:start position:0%
and that gets us to this due
process<00:40:38.640><c> thing</c><00:40:39.599><c> because</c><00:40:40.520><c> I</c><00:40:40.640><c> see</c><00:40:41.079><c> two</c><00:40:41.680><c> strands</c>

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.550 align:start position:0%

here<00:40:43.880><c> one</c><00:40:44.200><c> is</c><00:40:44.760><c> my</c><00:40:45.599><c> understanding</c><00:40:46.000><c> of</c><00:40:46.200><c> the</c>
