DCF is charged with considering all
 
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
matters on due process and practices
 
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.350 align:start position:0%
matters on due process and practices
concerning

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
DCF my interest in this topic began
 
00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 align:start position:0%
after I received complaints from
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
constituents who didn't feel there was
 
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate due process when it comes to
 
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
DCF child cust child protection cases I
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
heard from several individuals via
 
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
emails and I didn't really know how to
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
help them uh it wasn't my wheelhouse I'm
 
00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 align:start position:0%
not on the children and family law
 
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
committee so I am happy to have members
 
00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
of that committee here um I was
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with the related statutes I
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
found out very quickly that the statutes
 
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
are vast and um sort of scattered
 
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the rsas and the DCF statutes
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
co-mingle with the family court statutes
 
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
and so I appointed people to the special
 
00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 align:start position:0%
committee on the Family Court um and I I
 
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
started paying closer attention to these
 
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
matters because it seemed important then
 
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
beginning in October 2023 I started
 
00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
receiving signed notices from some of
 
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
the people that outlin concerns uh that
 
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
DCF statutes proceedings and practices
 
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
are not constitutional and therefore
 
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
reform is needed the people instructed
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
me to form a committee to work toward
 
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
resolving the issues raised so I went to
 
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
the speaker and presented my concerns I
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
shared the notices with him as well as
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
some as some affidavits and anecdotes
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
and he agreed that it was worth
 
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
investigating and so a committee was
 
00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 align:start position:0%
formed and here we are so thank you Mr
 
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
Speaker for
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
that uh I don't think it's missed by
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
anyone on this committee the gravity and
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
seriousness of the subject matter that
 
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking at um the
 
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
courts have long recognized that the
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
right of parents to direct the
 
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
upbringing of their children is a
 
00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
liberty interest protected by the due
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
process clause of the 14th am Amendment
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the United States
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
Constitution the New Hampshire
 
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution says in part one Article 15
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
despoiled or deprived of his property
 
00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 align:start position:0%

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
Judgment of his peers or the law of the
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
land and the courts have held that law
 
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
of the land is synonymous with due
 
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
process children being vulnerable and
 
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
cherished members of our society which
 
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
we all all have an interest in the
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
protection of ought never needlessly be
 
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
taken from a family nor left in a
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
situation that brings them harm and the
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
complaints I've received are concerning
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
both of those
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
outcomes um and that they occur as a
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
result of deficiencies in due process so
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
in this work we're ensuring protection
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
of the innocent as well as the
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
accused next meeting we will as a group
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
come to know and understand what due
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
bring your expertise your knowledge your
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
research and perhaps Witnesses we will
 
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
tease out what the Essential Elements of
 
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
due process are so that we're all on the
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
same page and before we begin our work
 
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
looking at processes and proceedings
 
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.309 align:start position:0%
looking at processes and proceedings
involving

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
involving
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
DCF then we'll find out through hearing
 
00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 align:start position:0%
testimony and conducting work sessions
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
if and how statute policies and
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
procedures conflict with or deny do
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
process then we'll make recommendations
 
00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
for reform if
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%

Constitution the legislature can make no
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
retrospective laws so we cannot
 
00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:48.919 align:start position:0%
legislate new outcomes for people who
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
to leave the DCU worker said well I'll
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
call back to the office and find out if
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
I can find another shortcut so that we
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
can continue our work that we have to
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
wrong the chair made the statement
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
of that other people have complained
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
about due process and the lack thereof
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
as far as the the rules within DCF and
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
statutes but there's also a third thing
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
that I would ask that this committee
 
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
consider is what
 
00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
happens even when things are compliant
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
with each other what do you do for due
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
process when people ignore how they are
 
00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
act which was done in my part and in my
 
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
and at that
 
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
point there are other stories that I
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
could tell you but I know that time is
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
short here but those are the two main
 
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
points I wanted to bring up to put
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
before the committee that I hope that
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
you look into and I have no problem in
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
giving more stories nor any problems in
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
answering any of your
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
questions will you take questions
 
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely any questions go ahead thank
 
00:18:55.149 --> 00:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
you madam chairwoman and thank you for
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
being here and telling your story we
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I just wanted
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
clarification so um what you said on the
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
due process what to do when people
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
ignore what they're supposed to do
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
specifically are you talking about the
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
DCF or the law enforcement or who who
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
are the people the law enforcement
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
person kind of smiled and he nodded when
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
I said what I did about the back seat
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
trying to make light of
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
situation the DCF investigative
 
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
specialist glowered at me okay and so
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
did the CAC person who just wanted to
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
get her job
 
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
done I will will be filing
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
grievances I already did a right to know
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
for the paperwork but given all of the
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
issues that my granddaughter has and I
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
had to deal with I couldn't do anything
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
at the time I'm going to revisit it I'm
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
not a person who likes it when people
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
try to do the wrong things to anyone and
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
when you make it personal I
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
remember but I would rather see the
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
committee be able to make its
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations to make that stop from
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
happening to somebody else I'm well
 
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
versed in what this goes on uh at the
 
00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.789 align:start position:0%
versed in what this goes on uh at the
state

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
level I put myself however in the
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
personage of somebody whose only idea of
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
DCF is like the IRS they'll take my
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
money but DCF will take my kids and they
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
have no recourse because they don't know
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
the law they don't know the practices
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
they don't know the people they don't
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
know the
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
processes that should also be part of of
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
due process and they never
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
know you're
 
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
welcome go ahead representative Gman
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
um so the important piece is your
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
granddaughter is that the child the
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
grand um what happened after that in
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
terms of was your granddaughter able to
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
access any services or anything because
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
obviously there was a crisis going on
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
it took some time and I'm not trying to
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
throw a bucket of water on DC wife as a
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
whole I will tell you that two of the
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
people I worked intimately with her case
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
worker out of the Berlin office as well
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
as the foster child
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
liaison that I talk to all the time was
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
fantastic so there are good people
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
working within the division it turned
 
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.029 align:start position:0%
working within the division it turned
out

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
that I'm trying to figure out a way to
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
say this
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
short my son and my daughter-in-law are
 
00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:36.110 align:start position:0%
short my son and my daughter-in-law are
both

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
vets she is
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
disabled having fallen down a flight of
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
stairs on the USS Ronald Reagan during
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
injuries

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
they the division decided that they were
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
going to go after her for
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
neglect because they believed that my
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
son abused my
 
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.390 align:start position:0%
son abused my
granddaughter

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
granddaughter
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
when she has a history of lying both I
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
and the Guilford Middle School have
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
corroborated those lies she has
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
emotional outbursts she has a history
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
and we'll tell you quite easily I hit my
 
00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:23.799 align:start position:0%

asked her where did you come from she
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
heard a far different question that set

her off thankfully the principal was out
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
there and saw the whole outburst

00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
escalation and at that point my wife and

Skilled care parents because we knew
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
behavioral specialist at D with
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock as well as emergency and
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
crisis we went Whole Hog we did almost a
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
100 hours of training in a month and a
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
she threatened to kill her mother
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
threatened to kill her father threatened
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
to kill her sister her other sister and
 
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
her brother she was vibrating so hard I
 
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
was sitting about 10 feet from her she
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
was yelling at my wife who was five feet
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
from her and I was thinking gosh I'm
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
going to get in trouble for what my son
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
got in trouble for which was to grab her
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
to restrain her to keep from hitting
 
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
her brother and sisters more I was going
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
to have to protect my wife yet that's
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
what the school district did and
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
dropping a dime on my son and
 
00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:12.039 align:start position:0%
daughter-in-law accusing him of abuse
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
because she ended up with a little Nick
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
on her
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
neck and my daughter-in-law for uh
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
neglect of preventing that
 
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
abuse well I think the Judge thought
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise once I get up on the stand
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
because I experienced all the same
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
things and I was able to let them
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
know and go from there I mean I
 
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
documented absolutely everything I
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
formed basically a task group of
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral specialists up in Dartmouth
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
all of the people at the Guilford Middle
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
School behavioral specialist there her
 
00:24:53.789 --> 00:24:53.799 align:start position:0%
casew worker there the principal there
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
the counselor and several DCF people
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
everybody always knew everything and
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
that was the key and I wish more people
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
would do that unfortunately from what I
 
00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:06.919 align:start position:0%
hear most people don't know enough to do
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
that so parents who are getting
 
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
entangled with
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
DCF probably need a little bit of
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
training of how to deal with DCF and how
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
to take care of the law because most
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
people can't afford a lawyer and don't
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
know where to
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
start I was an exception because I do
 
00:25:28.269 --> 00:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
politics um
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
um but as far as due process is
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
concerned to come
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
back there are a number of things that
 
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
also other things that went wrong as
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
well and I'm happy to help the committee
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
understand what they are with concrete
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
examples that I can back
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
up so does that answer your
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
question another question representative
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you um Madame chairwoman
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
would it be possible you seem to have
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
some pretty extensive information um to
 
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
even like give us written testimony to
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
email the committee so that way we can
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
kind of re I don't know if anybody else
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
is interested in that but it seems like
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on it might be
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
easier to um process and kind of
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
understand and stuff if you had a
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
written I I that you be will sh happy to
 
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
do that some of it's already out there
 
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
on the internet okay in full
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
DCF is nonpartisan
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
and I've only written about my part of
 
00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
it I've also written about my
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
grandson who we ended up having to adopt
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
that this was my third DC F tangl
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
because my younger son had served a year
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
in Afghanistan with 101st Airborne as a
 
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
uh door
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
kicker he came home with severe
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
PTSD took up with and was
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
self-medicating when he came home took
 
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
up with some somebody who was doing the
 
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
same they split then he found out he was
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
going to be a dad the day that my
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
grandson was
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
born he was in a lock down VA Ward
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
because he had made threats against
 
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
himself and it took him a long time
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
during the year
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
reconciliation he realized he was not
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
going to be able to get his act together
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
nor was the mother who abandoned him
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
when my wife went up the second day I
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
learned that DC wife has a permanent
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
office up at Dartmouth Hitchcock Lebanon
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
she pleaded with my wife to please take
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
my grandson once he got out of ncu
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
because he was born with opiates and
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
alcohol in his bloodstream he has been
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome
 
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
and a few other things but fortunately
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
he's doing very well but before that
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
ended my son made
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
the effort I will give up my parental
 
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
rights if you give up yours so that my
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
mother and father can
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
adopt there were things about that trial
 
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
that I or that reconciliation
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
process that there were things that DCF
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
did badly in that and I'd be happy to to
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
write about those so as you can tell
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
I've had a lot of experience on this
 
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
side of DCF again there were good people
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
during that process as well
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
and there were some bad people
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
especially a couple of that tried to
 
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
violate my constitutional
 
00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
rights so again you may have laws and
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
Norms set up but if people aren't
 
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
willing to follow those everybody is in
 
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
trouble not only the the parents and the
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
child but also the good
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
guys because the bad apples
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
spoil so I can do that thank you and
 
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
representative Leon you had a question
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
um yes sorry thank you madam chair and
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming and sharing
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
these experiences it seems that you've
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
had a lot of experience and seen the
 
00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
importance and the benefits of what DCF
 
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
does but how they can do it better and
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
is this sort of the the the the value of
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
what they do in order to make sure the
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
children are in the safe situation but
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
you would just want to make sure that
 
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's rights are protected in this
 
00:29:25.149 --> 00:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
process absolutely and that's part of
 
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
the process in fact the
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
the foster parent leaz Z has asked me to
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
come up to the Berlin office just to
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
give a talk to the other folks now semi
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
serious uh but it it hasn't happened yet
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
but know I'd be happy to do that for
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
anybody and in any office because there
 
00:29:48.509 --> 00:29:48.519 align:start position:0%
is good and bad um and I know that a lot
 
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
dcfc people read the harmony uh incident
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
see the dregs of society they were also
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
good parents that have had uh bad
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
information passed about them and that
 
00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
neither one is
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
good any further questions from the
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
you for being here today and taking my
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
question and I'm very sorry for the
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
difficulties that you have had to go and
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
and very thankful that you're looking
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
after some kids who need you um
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
the question that I have is a very
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
specific one going back to the first
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
incident that you talked about with the
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
lonia CAC and I understand your concerns
 
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
about being asked to sign something that
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
you were being asked to sign illegally
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
improperly uh but what I wanted to know
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
was did that CAC interview ever take
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
place and when and under what
 
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances well apparently the DC
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
worker found a workaround SL
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
shortcut and bypass that form because I
 
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
never signed it and they did do the uh
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
the interview from what I know now what
 
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
use would it have been at the time I
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
didn't know later on having had her at
 
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
our house for eight and a half
 
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
months I'm bet you she they didn't get
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
quite a straight story because that's
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
how she was
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately however to complete that
 
00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
story they realized that the the good
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
caseworker realized that the parents
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
weren't the problem the child and her
 
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
artistic older sister severely needed
 
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
intensive in-house
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
services and made it happen and that's
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
what's going on right now so that was a
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
good thing it took a process to get
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
there if the investigator had done the
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
due process who never talked to the
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
parents beforehand the school counselor
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
had never talked to the parents before
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
beforehand they just dropped the dime
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
and I got the Panic called you have to
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
pick up Julie from the school because
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
they won't let me see
 
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
her that was a in my understanding an
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
unethical if not legal uh abreg of due
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
process thank you you're quite quite
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
welcome any further oh representative
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
copal yes thank you madam chairwoman and
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so at
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
the beginning of your opening statement
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
you said and those are the two main
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
points that I want to make and I I I
 
00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
tend to keep going I think I gathered
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
that they were people don't always know
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
what their rights are and that people
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily believe that they have
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
they don't know where to go
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
for for redress if they if they don't
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
feel like they're getting due process
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
did I capture those correctly that's one
 
00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:54.039 align:start position:0%
okay and the other one is when you have
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
government employees who fail to to
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
follow the law and their own regulations
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's a problem how you deal with that
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
from a due process perspective which is
 
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
the you know what this committee is
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to do I don't have an
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
answer I'm not sure that anybody when is
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
going to have an answer given that
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
somebody can go Rogue I need to get this
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
done I'm going to do the shortcuts I
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
don't care what the law or the
 
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.070 align:start position:0%
don't care what the law or the
regulations

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
say but I think it's something that has
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
to be looked
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
at any further questions from the
 
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.360 align:start position:0%

your
 
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
testimony um now the current relation
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
you're having with DCF has been positive
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
is what I'm hearing is that
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
correct with respect to the case worker
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
for my granddaughter as well as my
 
00:33:59.549 --> 00:33:59.559 align:start position:0%
liaison as a foster parent
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely in fact um we have told them
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
that we would be willing to take more
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
foster kids especially babies when we
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
owned to daycare my wife made herself
 
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
the baby teacher so and we understand
 
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
that there is a need for that so yes it
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
is positive and that we're willing to do
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
it again after all if you spend all that
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
time and training you're not just going
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
to say 100 hours just for one child
 
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:30.760 align:start position:0%

our committee um I'll give an
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity now if anyone has questions
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
comments thoughts on our where we're
 
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
going from here represented
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
W actually just comment you know sitting
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
in children and family
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
law people come before you they're
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
frustrated we're the ones they want to
 
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
be talking to
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
however they're so frustrated that we
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
don't articulate a specific issue it
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
it's five issues um and it's hard it's
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
hard for us to to you know we that out
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
um so if somehow some way we could grab
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
an issue and and work through that and
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
then grab the next issue um that that
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
would be helpful in articulating
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
Solutions better you thank you and if I
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
may I I I totally agree I think we need
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
to um eventually have like a bulleted
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
list of what the the most common
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
concerns are um once we establish for
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
the committee our understanding of what
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
due process is so that's what next
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
um the next meeting will be on so once
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
we have that if you want if you all want
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
to be thinking about those things um
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
different categories of complaints um
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
that we can separate things out into and
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
help us be organized um that would be
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
great and I agree with you I had the
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
same experience when I was trying to
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
help um understand what these issues are
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
and I was talking to constituents and
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
people in the community and I would sit
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
for two hours with someone and it was
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
very hard to get to the nuts and bolts
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
of what the problems were with due
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
process and so um someone had told me if
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
you um that they could put it in an
 
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
affidavit then they could use it later
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
so I was helping people to write
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
affidavits I was helping them boil down
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
their their issue before we pursued this
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
Committee just to um kind of get it all
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
of their thoughts organized and on paper
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
and um in preparation for if they wanted
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
to take further action so I totally
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
understand and I I think to that end um
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
if anyone is going to bring testimony
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
written testimony to accompany your
 
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
verbal testimony is greatly
 
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
appreciated representative Le um thank
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um as far as um getting
 
00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
an information about what the common
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
concerns are I'd be curious if the
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate and
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
potentially DCF constituent relations if
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
they know what the most common
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
complaints are if they could can provide
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
any information they already have on
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
that that would be helpful I don't want
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
to task you with a new job but I'm
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
guessing there's probably at least some
 
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
casual list um if not a formal list of
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
what the common complaints are and it
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful for us to know
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing and we then we can
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
compare that with what we see I think
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea thank you
 
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.230 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea thank you
representative

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you well I'm I'm seeing a
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
couple of threads here and uh the first
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
one that I bring is just the concern
 
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
that I think you've actually already
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
articulated it but I see it in a
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
slightly different way which is on we're
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
balancing two very very important
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
concerns one is the sanctity of the
 
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
family and our desire to keep family
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
units together and whole and on the
 
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
other hand our desire to make sure that
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
children are
 
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.390 align:start position:0%
children are
safe

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
safe
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
and I want to acknowledge the very
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
difficult work that DCF does
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
because nobody is perfect and one
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
mistake in that
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
direction either damages a family or
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
damages a child's safety or both and
 
00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
none of that is anything that we want to
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
see so the work is difficult to begin
 
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
with SEC so so I just wanted to
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that because we are
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
balancing those two critical interests
 
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
um which is a basis when you look at the
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
interest for what processes then do um
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
and that gets us to this due
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
process thing because I see two strands
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
here one is my understanding of the
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
concept of legal due process which I see
 
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
as being more for the courts than anyone
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
else but it certainly percolates down
 
00:40:57.069 --> 00:40:57.079 align:start position:0%
through everybody's
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
dealings uh and the other thing is the
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
issue of simple structural
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
issues which are things that can be
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
discussed and addressed and if we find
 
00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:14.839 align:start position:0%
that it's a oneoff because somebody was
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
having a bad day that's one thing but if
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
it is something that is an ongoing issue
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
problem that we can help
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
work on Solutions um that's another
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
thing and I I speak as one who was on
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
the child abuse fatalities commission
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
back in
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
2015 and I came with a list of the six
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
or seven other entities that have
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
studied DCF and DCF issues since then
 
00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
and um I think it's very important that
 
00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
the work of examination go forward um
 
00:41:59.470 --> 00:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
but I also want to be sure that at the
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
end of it what we're doing is
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
generating a an action
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
list if there are things that we can
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
think of that are useful um and and that
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
committee actually did so um you know we
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
start where we are now and go forward
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
but I want to be sure that we're not too
 
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.549 align:start position:0%
but I want to be sure that we're not too
formulaic

00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
in I think it would be very very easy
 
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
for us to get tied up in whatever
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's notion of due process is to
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
the detriment of
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
practical understandings and
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
solutions so that's my
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
take thank you any other comments from
 
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
the committee I will make a comment uh
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
our committee researcher is kind enough
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
to be um employing a uh research inquiry
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
on the past commissions and committees
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
that have looked at dcy so she'll be
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
bringing us that information and I would
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
request also Christina um Christina Dyer
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
is our committee researcher everyone I'm
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't introduce you Christina
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
she's a very important person on this
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee um I I would request if you
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
would mind doing a research project on
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional due process and what the
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
elements of that are thank
 
00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.079 align:start position:0%
you any
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
further seeing no further discussion
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh we can schedule the next meeting we
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
were looking at March 4th and March 8th
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
and I did get a lot of feedback that uh
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
either of those dates were good but that
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
was probably a week or two ago yeah so
 
00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
all 11 okay and on the eight I am
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:57.230 align:start position:0%
all 11 okay and on the eight I am
still

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
ie on the eth okay how about the fourth
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
the fourth sounds like it might be
 
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
better still do one morning um well
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
considering the morning representative
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
Weber said that the morning before 11 on
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
the 4th would work for her I have a
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
limit I have a engagement on the morning
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
of the 8th so if folks are not available
 
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon that day it seems like
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
that day is a little
 
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
conflicted I'm
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay okay all right it seems like the
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
fourth is the most accommodating to
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
everyone um I apologize that we won't be
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes it's inevitable that
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
not everyone will make it um but I will
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
put in a request to see if we can
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
schedule for that morning the four 10 n
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
yes and with that I will close the the
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
yeah actually I just uh wanted there's a
 
00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:26.559 align:start position:0%
dcyf advis oversight committee that uh
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh sidel and myself sit
 
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.950 align:start position:0%
representative uh sidel and myself sit
on

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what Avenue that may be
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
helpful in uh just keeping them back of
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
youre okay and and there are several
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
well oh yes let's have a discussion on
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
who we should bring in so we probably
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
you can speak to DCF oversight committee
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
since you serve on it if you wanted to
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
present some information on what you the
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
advisory committee advisory yeah um and
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
we we want to hear
 
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.950 align:start position:0%
we we want to hear
from

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
constituent Services uh constituent
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
relations maybe from DCF we do want to
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
hear from the Department in general so
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
we should put out an invitation to
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
them um the CH and the the office of the
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
child advocate it will very helpful and
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
determining because one of the things
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
is that I think we all hear loud and
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
clear is people don't know where to go
 
00:46:38.349 --> 00:46:38.359 align:start position:0%
when something has not turned out the
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
way they think it ought to and uh there
 
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.589 align:start position:0%
way they think it ought to and uh there
are

00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
multiple Avenues but they're not
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily that easy to find but the
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate is one of
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
the things that came out of the
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
commission that I was on in in 2015 that
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
we're very glad is here
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
here great that's wonderful and there
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
was um I did want to send pass out um
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
just the notice because it does go over
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
the concerns with due process um that I
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
rece these notices I re I received
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
probably upwards of 150 of them and they
 
00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
do just kind of outline um the
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
Constitutional issues that some people
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
are seeing two three four five six um so
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
I did want you all to have a copy of
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
it would be great if you could provide
 
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
this in electronic format sure I can
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
send that out electronically
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
yep representative and also um I believe
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
representative weers on Health and Human
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
Services oversight if we if that is
 
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:47.720 align:start position:0%
becomes relevant to what we do as well
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
or does it not deal with that okay
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
because um although it although it does
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
deal with dcyf issues what it normally
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
does is it's dealing with the followup
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
to legislation that we've already passed
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
and how it's being implemented so
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and it deals with a great number of
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
things other than DCF so thank you I
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
just figured knowing which areas are
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
more relevant to it and those are not as
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
helpful so thank you for that
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
information and I'm sure you can thread
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
your experience there through whatever
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%

00:48:27.549 --> 00:48:27.559 align:start position:0%
also right any other suggestions for uh
 
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
entities that we should bring in I I
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to someone
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
representing uh the family court that
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
deals with these cases so I'd like to
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
