some slides on what we anticipate here
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
for the economy U Jen you
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
I just I just updated the setting my
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
much you full screen mode okay so um
 
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
obviously after 2020 um there's a off
 
00:08:17.469 --> 00:08:17.479 align:start position:0%
the expectation for 2021 and I think
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
those expectations will certainly be met
 
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
um for the narrative for throughout the
 
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
course of last year though we were
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
really focusing on whether or not uh we
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
had seen a durable economic and market
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
bottom in the us and uh we the reason
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
the way that we've been able to do this
 
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
sorry about this uh the way that we're
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
moning this was with our proprietary
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
recovery dashboard a group of nine
 
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
variables that have done an excellent
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
job of foreshadowing a durable economic
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
and market bottom it's a reverse
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
stoplight analogy so the goal here was
 
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
to go from a red recession to a yellow
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
Improvement ultimately to a green
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
expansion color and you can see the
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
entire progression of the dashboard over
 
00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
the course of 2020 where the dashboard
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
is flashing a red recession at the end
 
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
of March as the US economy is going
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
through shutdowns as we've transitioned
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
to June uh the dashboard is flashing a
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
green expansion at that point we're
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
advocating to our clients to upgrade and
 
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
risk take on more beta in their
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
portfolios uh to take advantage of this
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
budding economic recovery and it's
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
continued to get more green if you will
 
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of 2020 but as it
 
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
stands as of year end we have seven
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
green one red and one yellow signal uh
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
and I think it's really clear at this
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
point that we have seen in fact a
 
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
durable economic and market bottom um
 
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm going to get much push
 
00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
back from the group here considering
 
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
that the S&amp;P 500 was up 68% through the
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
lows into the year end and third quarter
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
GDP came in at
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
33.4% but if you think about that
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
recover it I think it was very
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
interesting and dynamic in two specific
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
facets first off earnings came in much
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
higher than anticipated um in the second
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
and third quarter of last year earnings
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
beats were much stronger than what you
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
saw during the last recovery
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
in fact it was the strongest earnings
 
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
beats that you've seen since 1996 and
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
looking so far here at fourth quarter
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
earnings that have come out um it does
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
appear that analysts are underestimating
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
the earnings potential for the S&amp;P 500
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
yet again and it's going to surprise to
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
the upside now the earnings came in much
 
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
better than anticipated obviously
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
because companies cut costs very
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
dramatically and quickly but the other
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
half of the equation was that you saw an
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
economy uh come on very strongly and U
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
the big question the middle part of last
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
year is what was the shape of the US
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
economy's recovery going to be and
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
against consensus expectations it ended
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
up being a v-shaped recovery and this is
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
best Illustrated through retail sales it
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
only took six months for retail sales to
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
recover their pre-recession Peak during
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
this recent crisis you compare that to
 
00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
the.com Bubble it took much longer at 16
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
months and then the global financial
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
crisis it took almost three years but if
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
you look over at retail sales on the Le
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
hand side which is that red line you can
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
see that it's hook down here recently in
 
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
fact you've seen negative retail sales
 
00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
prints on a month-over-month basis for
 
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
October November and December and a key
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
reason for that obviously is the
 
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
covid-19 crisis that the US is currently
 
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with you're seeing social
 
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
distancing measures come back into place
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
you're seeing economic retrenchment in
 
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:19.959 align:start position:0%
fact in 29 US states right now you're
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
seeing some form of restrictions on
 
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
indoor eating um but there is a key
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
difference between today and March uh
 
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
when you saw a large increase of cases
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
you saw a subsequent increase uh large
 
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
increase of deaths uh this time around
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
even though cases have spiked
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
dramatically deaths have only moved up
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh a fraction of what you saw earlier in
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
the year and it's a key reason obviously
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
why the US economy has continued to
 
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
remain open uh much more so than what
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
you saw at the end of the first quarter
 
00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless because of covid and the
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
increase of hospitalizations and deaths
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
you are seeing economic retrenchment and
 
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
it's you're not only seeing it slow down
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
in retail sales but you're also seeing
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
it in the labor market Market as well
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
now the latest jobs uh joess claims
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
print that we got last week jumped up to
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
965 th000 consensus expectations were
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
for that jobs print to come in below
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
800,000 so that's a huge Spike and at
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
965 th000 job losses in a week prior to
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
covid that would have been the largest
 
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
weekly job loss in US history so you're
 
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
seeing pronounced weakness in the labor
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
market you're also seeing it with the
 
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
monthly uh jobs reports uh we got a
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
December report a couple weeks ago it
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
came in well below consensus
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
expectations at Nega 140,000 um that was
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
the weakest jobs report outside of March
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
and April that you've seen since the
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
global financial crisis and it has a lot
 
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
of people wondering whether or not this
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
is just an economic slowdown or that
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is a double dip
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
recession and because of that we've
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
reintroduced our recession risk
 
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
dashboard a group of 12 variables that
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
have done an excellent job of
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
foreshadowing whether or not a recession
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
is on the horizon it's a a stoplight
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
analogy but it's in the reverse this
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
time where the goal is to go from a
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
green expansion to a yellow caution
 
00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
ultimately to a red recession uh and as
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
of the end of December we have seven
 
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
green three yellow and two red signals
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
but most importantly if you look at the
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
bottom of that First Column you have an
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
overall green signal which tells us that
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
this is just a Slowdown this isn't a
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
double dip recession and if you look all
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
the way to the left of the chart we
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
really try to look at the economy on the
 
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
three fault lines of economic activity
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
the very top there we're looking at
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
consumer health it's the biggest part of
 
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
the dashboard because it's the biggest
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
part of the US economy below that we
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
look at business activity obviously
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
businesses are responsible for hiring
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
and doing capex both of which have a
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
multiplier effect on economic activity
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
and then last but not least at the
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
bottom there we're looking at Financial
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
stresses because Financial stresses
 
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
usually emanate first before the economy
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
rolls over and I want to turn your
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
attention to the financial stresses
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
section all three of those indicators
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
right now are flashing a green expansion
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
color this shouldn't be a surprise to
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
anybody because if you look at the
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
Goldman Sachs Financial conditions index
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's the most accommodative in the
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
history of that Series so there's a lot
 
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:09.759 align:start position:0%
of liquidity squashing around in
 
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
financial markets but the other one I
 
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
want to point out is the second one
 
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
under business activity which is ISM
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing PMI new orders if you're
 
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
not familiar with manufacturing PMI all
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
it is it's a survey given to
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
manufacturers asking them how business
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
conditions are and also how business
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
conditions look to be in the future um
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
and the most forward-looking component
 
00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:31.759 align:start position:0%
of that survey is the new orders
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
component and Manufacturing PMI new
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
orders is synonymous with the business
 
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
cycle when it accelerates with a 3 to
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
six month lag the US economy generally
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
accelerates when it decelerates with a
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
three to six month lag US economy tends
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
to slow and ISM Manufacturing PMI new
 
00:14:51.749 --> 00:14:51.759 align:start position:0%
orders came in at a very strong print in
 
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
December at
 
00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:55.839 align:start position:0%
67.9 which tells us even though you are
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
seeing some weakness in the labor
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
markets that this is Transit
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
and the economy is going to be able to
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
power through this the other thing I'll
 
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
mention about that jobs report that we
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
got for December the headline numbers
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
very negative at negative 140,000 job
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
losses but if you look beneath the
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
surface I look at that as a very strong
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
jobs report because if you hospitality
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
and Leisure job losses over the course
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
of the month were
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
498,000 and it's not surprising that
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're seeing massive job losses in
 
00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
those sectors given the fact that you're
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
seeing economic retrenchment and a
 
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
return of social distancing um but if
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
you strip that cohort out the jobs
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
report was a very healthy
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
350,000 which shows you that the
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
underlying strength of the US economy is
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
resilient and the the underlying economy
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
is fine and once you get to the middle
 
00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:44.839 align:start position:0%
part of this year a lot of those job
 
00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519 align:start position:0%
losses that you're seeing in hospitality
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
and Leisure will come back as the
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
economy gets back to
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
normalization now the other thing I'll
 
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
mention obviously whether or not this is
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
a Slowdown or a double dier session
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
we're clearly in the Slowdown camp and
 
00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:00.519 align:start position:0%
and uh this there's a couple of reasons
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
why not only that the dashboard is
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
flashing a green expansion color but
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
also that the US economy is going to
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
reach her immunity sometime in the
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
second quarter or third quarter of this
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
year in fact if all the vaccines that
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
are expected to come online do um you're
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
going to have 5.1 billion shots
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
administered by the end of 2021 but US
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
economic activity is going to start to
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
accelerate well before herd immunity
 
00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:25.959 align:start position:0%
because as you start to inoculate
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
Frontline workers and also the most
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and Community type living
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
living types of situations and the
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
elderly you're going to see a decrease
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
of hospitalizations you're going to see
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
a decrease of deaths and economic
 
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
activity will naturally start to
 
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
increase at that point uh but also even
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
though the US has stumbled out of the
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
gate um with their inoculation efforts
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
um you have started to see an increase
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
closer to that 1 million shot per day
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
administ admin level that was
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
anticipated as we moved into December so
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
I I feel by the end of this month we're
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
going to be reaching those levels we're
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to be well in our way to reaching
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
her immunity but once you reach her
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
immunity this is a key key determination
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
of trying to unlock a lot of the
 
00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
consumer savings that have built up
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of the pandemic in
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
fact since the beginning of the pandemic
 
00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:14.839 align:start position:0%
you have total excess savings on the
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
consumer balance sheets of $1.4
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
trillion That's not including the
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
stimulus package that was passed in
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
December with $600 checks going to every
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
American that's qualifies it doesn't
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
include the likely additional stimulus
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
that's coming out from the Democratic
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
package that was released here recently
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
um obviously you're probably going to
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
see some additional stimulus going to
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
Consumers so it wouldn't be a surprise
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
to me if you see total excess savings
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
north of $2 trillion dollar by the
 
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
middle part of this year and it's I
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
think once you get to that point you're
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
going to see Revenge spending deferred
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
gratification um people going to spend a
 
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
lot on services and going to really
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
juice economic growth in the back half
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
of the year and the one thing I think
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
that's really different today versus the
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
global financial crisis is people are
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
accumulating savings not because of
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
caution on the part of households but
 
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:06.919 align:start position:0%
they're accumulating savings because
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have the ability to spend on
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
Services uh because of Mobility
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions and her immunity will will
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
take away that hurdle and really unleash
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of this Capital but this is one of
 
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
the key reasons why we expect uh
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
economic activity above consensus
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
expectations for the next couple of
 
00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:26.919 align:start position:0%
years also you're going to see a very
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
massive inventory rebuilding cycle in
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
the US uh inventory levels relative to
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
sales have not been this depleted since
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
2014 but now that businesses finally
 
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
have some visibility into the back half
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
of the year um they're going to unleash
 
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
a massive inventory rebuilding cycle in
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
order to anticipate that future demand
 
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
and this is really going to boost
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing activity in the first half
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
of 2020 2021 I should say the other
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
thing that I think is going to boost
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
economic activity is the macro Trifecta
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
these three ingredients have been
 
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
crucial for fueling strong economic
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
rebounds that's long lower long rates so
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
a low 10-year treasury uh weaker energy
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
costs and a weaker dollar and if you
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
look at long low long low long rates and
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
a weaker energy cost they are much more
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
depressed than what you've typically
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
seen in an economic recovery and this
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
going to provide a Tailwind well into
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
2022 and it's clearly being reflected by
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
consensus expectations in 2021 it's
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
expected to be the best growth in the US
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
economy in over 20 years but this just
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
isn't a one-year phenomena off of easy
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
comps because of the recession in 2022
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
that's expected to be the best growth
 
00:19:40.039 --> 00:19:41.270 align:start position:0%
that's expected to be the best growth
since

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
2004 and this does not include the
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
stimulus that was passed in December and
 
00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
the likely new stimulus is coming out
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
over the next couple of months uh which
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
is why we expect economic growth well
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
above consensus expectations of closer
 
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
above consensus expectations of closer
to

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
6% and I I think there's a key
 
00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
consideration here that I think Market
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
parti participants and policy makers are
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
really underestimating the massive
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
amount of savings that you've seen not
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
only on the consumer side but on the
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
corporate side of well side as well and
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
what that's going to do to juice
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
economic activity once you reach herd
 
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
immunity and uh I I think obviously with
 
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
policy makers underestimating that that
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
increase of activity um one of the the
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
key policy makers that I think are
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
underestimating what the US economy can
 
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
grow at is the Federal Reserve the FED
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
is clearly fighting the last battle
 
00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
which is the global financial crisis and
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh they have their foot all the way down
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
on the accelerator and one of the ways
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
that you can see this is through
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
quantitative easing now the United
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
States has a much larger ability to do
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
quantitative easing versus the Euro zone
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
or Japan uh given the fact that our
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
balance sheet is much lower as a percent
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
of GDP but at present um the Federal
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
Reserve is doing $120 billion dollars
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
worth of bond purchases per month um and
 
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
they're not going to they're going to
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
continue to do that until they see
 
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
substantial further progress on both the
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate and inflation and
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
given the rosy optimistic Outlook that
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
we just talked about again 120 billion
 
00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:06.919 align:start position:0%
per month is a massive number um it's
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
one and a half times larger than any
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
previous QE program that we've seen in
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
the US but also they're not only just
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
doing QE they've actually changed to an
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
average inflation targeting regime and
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
the key reason for this is because
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
they've willfully missed their two%
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
inflation Target since 2008 at the very
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
top of the screen you can see that
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
they've only hit that 2% Target three
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
times over the last 12 years so in order
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
to fix that they're going to make up for
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
those those that shortcoming and they're
 
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
going to let inflation run hot over 2%
 
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
for a prolonged period of time and uh
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
the two things that they're really
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
looking for in order to start raising R
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
rates is they want to see the
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate back to where they it
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
was prior to covid-19 which is
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
3.6% and they want to see inflation
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
sustainably above 2% for a period of
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
time now looking at the fed's Dot Plot
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
which is what their expectations are for
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate and inflation it
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
goes out till the end of 2023 and at
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
that point the FED expects the
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate to be at 3.7% which
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
will be close to the Target that they've
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
outlined but they only see inflation
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
being 2% at that time um so from the
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
fed's vantage point they don't see
 
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
themselves raising rates until 2024 at
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
the earliest and this is a really
 
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
important consideration because usually
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
the FED has their fingerprints on most
 
00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
recessions as they start to raise rates
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of inflation they
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
usually raise rates a little bit too
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
much and end up causing a recession this
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
time around the FED is recognized that
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
raising rates too early is more
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the US economy than
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
raising rates later and they're not
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
going to get in the way of this economic
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
expansion that we have in front of us
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
and uh they're going to let the economy
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
run hot over the course of the next
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
couple of years now this is a very
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
important backdrop for the economy and
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
risk assets but one of the things that I
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
I think is an important consideration
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
here is that the two recoveries that we
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
have today versus the global financial
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
crisis couldn't be more different first
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
off one of the big differences is the
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
origin of the the recession this
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
recession that we recently has was
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
caused by an exogenous event and the
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
economy was in Fairly good position and
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
you know very fairly strong position as
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
the economy shut down back during the
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
global financial crisis you had
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
pre-existing conditions with an
 
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
overheated housing market an
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
overextended consumer and Bank leverage
 
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
issues and it really took three or four
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
years to work out those issues before
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
the economy can start to accelerate and
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
heal on its own and we just don't have
 
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
that overhang this time around the
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
second difference is the policy
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
prescription today was exactly the right
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
one policy makers came out forcefully
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
and aggressively they got business
 
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
businesses and consumers access to
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
Capital in a fast and efficient manner
 
00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:53.559 align:start position:0%
um back during the global financial
 
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
crisis it took a long time to calibrate
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
the right policy response and because of
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
that you had longer and deeper scarring
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh last cycle and the other difference
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
is the health of health of the average
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
household um households are in very good
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
shape because of a strong housing market
 
00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:12.039 align:start position:0%
financial markets are up substantially
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
from the lows obviously had an abundance
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
of fiscal stimulus and the inability to
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
spend and versus the end of 2019
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
household net worth is up 5.2 trillion
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
doar um that's going to go a long way to
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
helping this recovery unfold over the
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
next couple of years but maybe the
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
biggest difference between the two uh
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
recessions and recoveries is found in
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
the labor market now what we're looking
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
at here is the nfib small business
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
hiring plans survey and if you're not
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
familiar with the nfib survey it's the
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
premier small business survey it took
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
until 2014 to regain pre-recession
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
levels coming out of the global
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
financial crisis today we've already
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
recovered it in less than nine months
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
looking at us job openings it's a
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
similar situation it took until 2014 to
 
00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
get back to pre-recession levels we
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
today us job openings are where we were
 
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
as we went into Co 19's crisis and this
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
is a very important consideration
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
because if you have a lot of job
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
openings out there that means that you
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
can see a labor market that heals much
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
faster than anticipated and much faster
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
Trend economic growth and this crisis
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
77% of the job losses were in covid
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
sensitive Industries and as we reach her
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
immunity and we get to some level of
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
normalization again these are going to
 
00:25:28.389 --> 00:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
be jobs and the job Creation in that
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
industry is going to happen much quicker
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
than what we saw just a decade ago
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
you're also seeing a difference in
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
confidence again this is the nfib survey
 
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
which is that Premier small business
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
survey in the US took until 2014 to get
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
to pre-recession levels we're already at
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
that point currently and if you think
 
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
about one cohort that should be hurting
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
the most from the crisis it's small
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
businesses because a lot of their uh
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
business models rely on face-to-face
 
00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
interactions and with social distancing
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
and economic retrenchment it's hitting
 
00:25:59.549 --> 00:25:59.559 align:start position:0%
small businesses the hardest um but
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
clearly they are they're very confident
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
even in light of the economic slowdown
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
that we've seen here recently you're
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
also seeing it in the CEO Roundtable
 
00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:10.039 align:start position:0%
business confidence survey again we're
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
at pre- recessionary levels there and if
 
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
you have business confidence that means
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
businesses will invest in the future
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to do capex they're going
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
to hire of course that all has a
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
multiplier effect on the economy you're
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
seeing business confidence in a
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
different way as well through business
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
formation applications back in the
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
global financial crisis not surprisingly
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
you saw business formation applications
 
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
plummet uh all the way through the
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
crisis and even through the the first
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
year and a half of that recovery this
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
time around you're seeing business
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
formation applications Skyrocket they're
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
up 25% year-over-year and again it's
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
creative destruction this is AB Bess
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
very well for the next couple of years
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
of economic growth the last difference
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
in the two cycles is really from a
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
demographic perspective and one of the
 
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
most underrated reasons of why you saw
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
slow growth during the last decade was
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
from demographics and those headwinds
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
were coming from two distinct areas on
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
the right hand side of the chart you saw
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
a huge increase of baby boomers that
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
were exiting the workforce a huge
 
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
increase that the US economy has never
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
seen before and as people retire they
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
spend and earn less that's a headwind to
 
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
economic growth but also in the middle
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the chart there you can see that
 
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
Boomers exiting their Prime spending and
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
earnings years which happens to be ages
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
35 through 54 in the US they were being
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
replaced by a much smaller Gen X which
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
means smaller fewer individuals entering
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
into those Prime spending and earnings
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
years you fast forward to today instead
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
of having a demographic headwind you
 
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
have a demographic tailwind and it's
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
really similar to 1994 now in the middle
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
of the chart there you can see that
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
Millennials entering into their Peak
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
years is going to be a Tailwind to
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
economic growth in the US well into the
 
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
next decade really over the next 15
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
years you have more and more Millennials
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
spending and earning more um but the
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
demographic Tailwind is going to be less
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
than what we saw in 1994 because if you
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
look on the right hand side of the chart
 
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
you have a lot more baby boomers heading
 
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
into retirement today versus what you
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
saw about 25 years ago so taking a step
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
back and talking you know about you know
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
what the core conclusion is here is that
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
this is a very different setup than what
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
we had coming out of the global
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
financial crisis is a different cause of
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
the recession you don't have any
 
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
economic overhangs like you had back in
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
the global financial crisis the policy
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
prescription was right so you had less
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
economic scarring
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
households are in a very strong position
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
to continue spending labor markets are
 
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
in a very good position today um also
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
you have broad-based confidence and
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
demographics are going to be helpful to
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
economic growth and this all is in a
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
backdrop when the FED is not going to
 
00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
take the punch bow away from the party
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
and they're going to remain very
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
accommodative well into this recovery
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
which is not the traditional experience
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
that we've seen now one thing I'll
 
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
mention is there's a lot of people that
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
are concerned about valuations at the
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
moment uh with the forward P of the
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
market at 2 2.5 you've only seen this
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
eclipsed back in during the dot bubble
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
um but one thing I want to mention here
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
is you you can't look at valuations in
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
isolation valuations today should be
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
different than what you see valuations
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
in 1980 versus 1950 and the reason why I
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
say that is for a number of different
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
reasons first off the index composition
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
of the S&amp;P 500 has been different over
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
the last hundred years and in order to
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
illustrate this what we did is we looked
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
at all the cyclical areas of the market
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
which are financials Industrials
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
materials and energy we've bracketed
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
them together and that's the dark gray
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
line that you see in front of you and
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
then we bracketed all your growth
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
stability and defensive sectors together
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
which is the Blue Line there and and
 
00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:39.559 align:start position:0%
traditionally cyclical sectors are
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
awarded lower PE multiples because they
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
have huge swings in their earnings
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
potential based on economic activity um
 
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
and your growth stability and defensive
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
areas of the market are usually awarded
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
higher pees because they usually have a
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
high degree of earnings visibility they
 
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
have Moes around their business or
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
they're growing much faster than the
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
index overall and as of today cyclical
 
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
representation of the S&amp;P 500 is at a
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
100-year low at 23% so the average p PE
 
00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:10.519 align:start position:0%
of the market has been 16 given this
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
less Cy cyclical representation in the
 
00:30:14.909 --> 00:30:14.919 align:start position:0%
S&amp;P 500 maybe it should be a couple of
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
turns higher the other reason why
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
valuations should probably be higher
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
today versus history is because interest
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
rates are low and in fact as of the end
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
of the year 49% of the S&amp;P 500 had a
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
dividend yield greater than a 30-year
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
treasury um so if you think about
 
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
interest rates one of the key components
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
of valuating uh stocks and the earnings
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
of a stock is interest rates and if you
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
have a lower discount rate all things
 
00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
considered you should have a higher P
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
multiple to pay for that dollar of
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
earnings the other thing that I'll
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
mention right now is usually at this
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
point in the cycle stocks look expensive
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
because as you come off of recessionary
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
troughs usually PE multiple Skyrocket as
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
the market anticipates future earnings
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
growth and the Market grows into that
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
earnings expectation so if you look at
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
the off of the trough of the tech bubble
 
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
and the global financial crisis almost
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
the entirety of the S&amp;P 500 returns
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
during those first five nine months was
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
from pees expanding but as you move to
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
the 12 months following that point and
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
the 12 months following that point so
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years the Baton hands
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
off two earnings and they really Drive
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
um the market forward uh in those
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
subsequent years and you actually see PE
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
multiples decline in years two and
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
following a earnings an economic trough
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
putting this all together how stretch
 
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
your out evaluations well the historic
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
PE is 16 you take sector mixed impact
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
into consideration the lack of
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
cyclicality maybe historic earnings
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
should be one turn higher versus history
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
you take low interest rate rates into
 
00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
consideration should be two turns higher
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
versus history considering the robust
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
earnings backdrop that we have in 2021
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
and 2022 one and a half turns higher
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
than that and then in that other bucket
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
that's a a number of different uh
 
00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:00.919 align:start position:0%
considerations free cash flow generation
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
is much higher versus history you have
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
higher margins as well and this also is
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
a over undervaluation versus what fair
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
value should be so if you put this whole
 
00:32:13.389 --> 00:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
waterfall together uh at forward PE at
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
22.5 today maybe 21.5 is fair value
 
00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
given all these dynamics that we talked
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
about so this isn't the.com bubble 2.0
 
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:24.039 align:start position:0%
there's a key reason why you have
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
valuations at these current levels and
 
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
again given our above consensus
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
expectations for economic growth we
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
think earnings could surprise to the
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
upside next year the last thing I'll
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
mention here is usually um if markets
 
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
have moved a long way off of the trough
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of people think that there isn't
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
more upside for the S&amp;P 500 but this is
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
not the way that we're thinking about
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
things in fact we do think that the S&amp;P
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
500 has a lot more upside uh for the
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
rest of this expansion um so we looked
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
at the S&amp;P 500 from the start of every
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
economic expansion since 1970 and what
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
it returned to the start of the next
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
recession we're not looking at the
 
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:02.519 align:start position:0%
market trough which happened to be March
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
23rd but the start of the economic
 
00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:06.519 align:start position:0%
expansion which we don't know yet
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
because the NBR has not designated when
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
the recession ended but from our
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
estimation we think it's probably going
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
to be June so this is looking at it
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
really from July 1st through the end of
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
this expansion and if you look at that
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
blue area there the average move higher
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
in the S&amp;P 500 is 96% but if you look
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
right below that the average move higher
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
in a secular bull market is 149% and one
 
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
of our core views and it's that we are
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
clearly in a secular bull market in the
 
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
US and if you're not familiar with the
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
term usually us financial markets go
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
through a 10 to 20 year period where
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
they go nowhere that's better known as a
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
secular bare market and they're followed
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
by a 20year period where the markets go
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
up substantially better known as a
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
secular bull market so in the 30s and
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
40s on the lefthand side you can see
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
there's a pretty substantial secular
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
bare market during those two decades
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
your cumulative return was negative 22%
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
but that g gave rise to the secular Bull
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
of the 50s and 60s return jumped up to
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
450% of course that gave rise to the
 
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
secular bear of the 70s with high
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
inflation returns were roughly flat
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
followed by the secular Bull of the 80s
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
and 90s return jumped up to 1,50% and
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's our view and it continues to be our
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
view that we exited the secular bear of
 
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
the 2000s we're now in year 11 of 20
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
where you're going to see outsize Equity
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
returns obviously doesn't mean you're
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
going to aren't going to have bumps on
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
the road or recessions because we
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
clearly just had one but if this trend
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
continues which has been going on for
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
the last 90 years there's going to be a
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
lot more upside for us equities as we
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
move through this decade and everybody
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
always asks what's going to propel this
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
secular bull market higher um I think
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's clear that this is a different
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
recovery and the FED is not going to get
 
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
in the way of that recovery in the near-
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
term so it's going to be really good for
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
risk assets also I think there's a clear
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
difference that the Baton has moved uh
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
handed off from monetary policy to
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy if you think back to the
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
last recovery um you even though
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
monetary policy was very aggressive um
 
00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy was a little bit more
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
restrictive there was a lot of austerity
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
measures this time around both fiscal
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
policy monetary policy are rowing in the
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
same directions uh which is going to be
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
a powerful force and then lastly I think
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a lot of investors
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
move towards dividend paying equities
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
for income and growth of income uh in
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
this low rate environment um so you know
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
maybe to sum everything up um even
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
though the markets have moved a long way
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
off of the lows we do think that there's
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
some more upside from here valuations
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
look expensive but if you take low
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
interest rates into consideration sector
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
mix and the expectations for strong
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
earnings over the next couple of years I
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
think these valuations are Justified um
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
and then also um I think economic growth
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
is really going to surprise on the
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
upside because of all those differences
 
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
that we talked about with the global
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
financial crisis but also consumers will
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
likely have2 trillion dollar in excess
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
savings to be able to fuel that recovery
 
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
over the next couple of years um so with
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
that maybe I can turn it back to uh um
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
to the audience to see if you guys have
 
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:08.190 align:start position:0%
to the audience to see if you guys have
any

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Jeff that was very
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
stimulating a lot of good
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
information um now we're going to get a
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
get to be able to use these charts I
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
hope my question is
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
this what our biggest source of Revenue
 
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
in the state comes from business
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
taxes and so that and we have to project
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
revenues out for a two-year period
 
00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
starting July 1
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
2021 what would you say that the GDP or
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
the growth of U businesses will be on
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
average over these two two years
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
starting July 1
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.550 align:start position:0%
starting July 1
2021

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
2021
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I think U most businesses that have
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
were going to go out of business
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
probably will uh over the next six
 
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
months um but again I think given the
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
business formation Trends um I think
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to see an acceleration of
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
of of number of businesses that uh that
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
are going to be in the state but also
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
the amount of Revenue that you're going
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
to see um and given the expectation for
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
above Trend growth uh you know 6% real
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
GDP growth is probably closer to 8%
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
nominal GDP growth um I would expect a
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
huge bump in in and business taxes over
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years um somewhere in
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
the tune of you know call it six to
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
eight% All Things
 
00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:36.109 align:start position:0%
eight% All Things
Considered

00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
Considered
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
urle um thank you Mr chair I've got
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
several questions actually but uh let's
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
begin with the ones you you uh talked
 
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
about one of the driving forces of the
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
economic growth over the last uh decade
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
has been weaker energy costs and uh a
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
stable wage
 
00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:27.319 align:start position:0%
environment if the government starts to
 
00:38:28.829 --> 00:38:28.839 align:start position:0%
play with these things either the
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
federal or state level what would be the
 
00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
effect you've got a crystal ball in
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
front of you so you just have to ask it
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
and get the answer right away what would
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
be the effect on uh our economy would it
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
go up would it go down would it remain
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
the same you know that kind of
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
thing yes so one of the the the um
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
obviously the the key tendance of
 
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
Biden's agenda is higher minimum wage of
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
going to $15 um that would obviously be
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
cumulative for on a state level for
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
payroll taxes um but and from a federal
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
level from payroll taxes um it would
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
also bring down you know obviously the
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
bottom line for for a lot of small
 
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
businesses I say the net effect is
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
probably neutral um it's just you know
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to be labor that gains more
 
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
share versus capital in that instance um
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
so I don't necessarily see a big
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
difference there um also as far as wage
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
growth is concerned if you aren't able
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
to pass a higher minimum wage tax I I
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
see wage growth remaining relatively
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
stable over the next couple of years
 
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
because the unemployment rates at 6.7%
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
which means there's still quite a bit of
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
slack left in the US economy usually
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
you'll start to see wage growth
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
percolate higher when that gets closer
 
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
to 5% um so again um I don't see a huge
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
Effect one way or another um with that
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
higher minimum wage if it does go into
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
effect at a federal level um and then
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
your other question was minimum wage and
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
then if I forget the other half energy
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
energy yeah so there's a lot of Supply
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
out there on with the energy on on the
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
energy front um even if you do see
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions on being able to Frack on
 
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
federal lands um Shale producers right
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
now are really just trying to generate
 
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
free cash flow rather than growth at all
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
costs which is a key difference from the
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
model that they had really through the
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
beginning part of that last deck G
 
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
2016 um also the global Supply there's a
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of oil out there right now um and
 
00:40:22.589 --> 00:40:22.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a until you can get
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
to a full um global economy um to be
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
able to get back to normalized levels of
 
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
demand which is around 100 million
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
barrels per day you're going to continue
 
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
to see energy costs kind of languish
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
here in the the 50 or $60 range um you
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
really got to see a return of air travel
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh to get back to normalization before
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
you could see energy costs at 70 or $80
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
a barrel because uh jet fuel accounts
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
for about 7% of global uh en uh Global
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
oil demand All Things Considered so um I
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
don't see you know anything changing on
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
the energy front I think oil is going to
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
be pretty well pinned in this 50 to to
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
$55 Barrel range over the next couple of
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
years regardless of regulations and you
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
know some U regulations on frackers here
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
in the US follow up Mr chair um just one
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
because we have about eight more people
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
questions I saw that and the followup is
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
uh you also talked about a growing
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
savings uh um with that's common folk uh
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
1 Point uh five trillion heading towards
 
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
two trillion you
 
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
anticipated um do you believe that uh
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
there will be an attempt by the
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
government to attempt to recoup some of
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
that money for their own
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
coffers I don't I don't um I think it'
 
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
be very difficult to to be able to to do
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
that uh especially you know if you look
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
at governmental actions here recently um
 
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
you know you had that $600 stimulus
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
check that went out in December um
 
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
there's talk of making that another
 
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
$1,400 stimulus check um so they're
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
clearly seeing the savings rate but they
 
00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
do recognize ize that there's a lot of
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
lower and middle inome individuals and
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
households that are going to need those
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
checks in order to get through the first
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
and second quarter until you can get to
 
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
some some sort of normalization so I I
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
actually don't see a situation where the
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
the government will try to recoup that
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
money thank
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
Ames thank you um and thank you for the
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
presentation it was really excellent
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
encourage encouraging I would say uh
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
the Assumption in there or at least one
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
of the points you made was that uh that
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
we'd reach her
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
immunity sometime in the second half
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
early part of the second half of uh of
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
this year as I understood it um and I've
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
seen other forecasts on that score that
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
put it out another year actually um and
 
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
so my question really is uh what
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
difference does that make to your
 
00:43:02.549 --> 00:43:02.559 align:start position:0%
forecast suppose suppose uh the supply
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
of vaccinations doesn't gear up uh the
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh the other snags whatever in the
 
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
vaccination process and uh we don't come
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
to her immunity until mid
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
2022 uh what then yeah ratchet my
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
economic growth expectation down
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
dramatically um you're going to see a
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
lot more pain in the services a lot more
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
bankruptcies um but I would anticipate
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
if that was indeed the case um that you
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
probably have more stimulus coming out
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
of Washington over the course of 2021 to
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
be able to stem the tide until we can
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
get to her immunity um but uh you know
 
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
from all the projections that that I've
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh looked at here recently um I would
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
imagine at the latest her immunity
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
coming in at the end of the third
 
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
quarter I think one of the bigger
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
obstacles is you know giving the
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
American public uh some people have some
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
reluctance uh on taking a vaccine given
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
the quick timeline that these have been
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
coming out versus you know the
 
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
traditional five or 10 years that you've
 
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
seen from a vaccine perspective um but
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
you know as long as the vaccines that
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
are in commercialization come to
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
commercialization and what I'm really
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
looking for is Johnson and Johnson's
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
advocacy data um if Johnson and Johnson
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
can get through uh the the FDA the
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
hurdles of coming to commercialization
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
um I I think her immunity will be
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
reached sometime in the third quarter
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
because they're they're going to be the
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
the one that could bring the most doses
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
online not only for the us but for the
 
00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.630 align:start position:0%
online not only for the us but for the
global

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
global
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
Ronnie thank you uh great presentation I
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
just want to follow up on Jordan's
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
question a little bit more um let's talk
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
about a few other issues that may change
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh things philosophies that may change
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
number one regulation on business but
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
two more importantly is the tax tax Pol
 
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
tax increases potentially Jolie
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
especially business tax uh increases in
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
areas that have
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
incentivized companies to come back to
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
America um can you just touch on that a
 
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.630 align:start position:0%
America um can you just touch on that a
little

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
bit yeah obviously to to be able to pay
 
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
for the most recent stimulus package
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
taxes are going to to have to rise I do
 
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
think businesses will bear the brunt of
 
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
that um I I I would imagine the
 
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
corporate tax rate moving back up to 25
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
26% from 21% currently um you can see
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
higher taxes on on cap gains um I could
 
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
see that going up to 25 26% as well um I
 
00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:31.559 align:start position:0%
think the top income bracket will move
 
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
back to where it was prior to the Trump
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
tax cuts at
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
39.6% um but again I think those are
 
00:45:40.109 --> 00:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
really going to be the the only key
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
taxes that come into play here um I know
 
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
the headline number for the new stimulus
 
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
package is 1.9 trillion um I think that
 
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
number is going to come drastically down
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
um probably into the1 trillion dollar
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
range um and uh you know again the key
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
here is given the fact that the US
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
economy is in a precarious position here
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
you're seeing a deceleration of Labor
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
Market activity um I think these tax
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
increases probably come into effect in
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
20122 because uh obviously you don't
 
00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
want to derail the budding recovery that
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
we have right now um so overall I I do
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
see higher taxes um I do see higher
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
taxes especially for uh a lot of your
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
companies that have overseas tax
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
shelters um I I think you know big tech
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
for example is going to see much higher
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
taxes um but overall um still
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
corporations are in a better position
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
today even with these tax increases than
 
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
when they were uh going into the Trump
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
tax cuts that happened back in 2017 so
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
net net obviously it'll be reflected on
 
00:46:40.549 --> 00:46:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh the financial markets you could see
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
markets go down about five or 7% to
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
price in this new tax reality um but uh
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
again given the robust economic backdrop
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
that I've outlined here I think
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
businesses are going to be able to
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
overcome this momentary increase of of
 
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
their tax liability and they their
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
pressure on their their margin
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
structure uh representative
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
southw thank you great uh presentation I
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
wondered um are there things that you
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
really feel are specific or unique to
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it seemed like last time
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
we were one of the last New England
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
states to kind of bounce
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
back yeah you guys are number one one of
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
the number one drivers of the economy is
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
smart manufacturing um I think that's
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
going to be a theme uh throughout the
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
course of the next decade I I think New
 
00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is well positioned on that
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
front as well um so you know I think you
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
guys are well positioned to to be able
 
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
to thrive over the next decade um
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
because of that core competency and that
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
leadership that you have um that that's
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that we looked at
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
um prior to the call and I think it's
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a key differentiator for
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
jenin thank you Mr chairman um nice
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
presentation Jeffrey very informative um
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
just to build on representative Abram's
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh questions I had the same questions
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
but I guess when you talked about the
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
next decade being pretty strong I'm
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
assuming you've
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
already uh put in the fact that you
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
believe taxes will be higher regulations
 
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
will be more intense so when you talk
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
about that you you're already planning
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
for that yes yeah okay thank you
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm wondering about
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
something fairly different on the
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
business taxes are our biggest taxes but
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
on we have a wide range of other
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
consumption taxes in this state uh that
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
affect mostly the middle class and how
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
far down does ownership of these savings
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
go at this point in the in the structure
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
bifurcated economy it's a great question
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
and I think you've hit the the on the
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
head for most of the stimulus package
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
that come out um lower income households
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
have spent a majority of those uh the
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal stimulus that has come out um
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
middle class has saved uh you know more
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
than the the lower income hoses but it's
 
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
really the the top death that has saved
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
the most um but nonetheless given this
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
fact that you have you know roughly
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
$2,000 going to each American that's
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
qualifies uh over the course of the the
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
next year if assuming that the package
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's been forth put out with the
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
Democrats goes into effect um that's
 
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
going to go a long way to to Really
 
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
juicing up the savings rate for low and
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
middle inome houses so I I think you're
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
going to see a boom in in your uh your
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
state regardless uh even if it is more
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
middle income than than lower or
 
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.589 align:start position:0%
middle income than than lower or
high

00:49:56.589 --> 00:49:56.599 align:start position:0%
high
 
00:49:56.599 --> 00:50:00.190 align:start position:0%
high
Senator

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
guer Bob you have to unmute Bob you need
 
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
to unmute yourself okay there we go
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
um from the from the point of view of
 
00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:15.079 align:start position:0%
prognostication would it be appropriate
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
to say that we could be moderately
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
conservative for the first of the two
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal years for which we're preparing a
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
budget and somewhat more more for lack
 
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:28.839 align:start position:0%
of a better word exuberant or certainly
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
positive as far as revenues to the state
 
00:50:34.589 --> 00:50:34.599 align:start position:0%
in the second year of the
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
bium well I I I I think it all comes
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
down to you know how how much economic
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
retrenchment you see over the course of
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
the first and second quarter here right
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
um if you continue to see the virus case
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
load increase um which we gotten through
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
the holiday season I would imagine that
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
you're starting to see a plateau of
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
cases and they'll start to come down and
 
00:50:54.789 --> 00:50:54.799 align:start position:0%
economic activity starts to accelerate
 
00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
meaningfully at the end of the first
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
quarter which is my expectation um I
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
think you know you you don't necessarily
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
have to be more prudent year one versus
 
00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:04.839 align:start position:0%
year two um but if you do see cases
 
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
continue to increase you know post
 
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
holidays as we get into February and
 
00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:11.559 align:start position:0%
March um again that that may be a better
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
way to approach it but I would I just
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
based on my expectation right now I
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
think both years are going to be very
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
strong economically speaking and I don't
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that you have to be
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
more prudent year one versus your year
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
two at this
 
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:27.270 align:start position:0%
two at this
point

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
Tucker took my hand down all right then
 
00:51:36.559 --> 00:51:38.230 align:start position:0%
Tucker took my hand down all right then
representative

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
Baxter thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey for your presentation I just
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on your comment about
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage and it being neutral
 
00:51:50.789 --> 00:51:50.799 align:start position:0%
for the economy the CBO released a
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
report about six months ago saying a $15
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
minimum minimum wage would cost CA about
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
3.7 million job losses so especially in
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where 90 plus% of the
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
employers are small businesses isn't it
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
more likely that's going to have a more
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
negative effect in New
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Well yeah if 90% of the the
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
businesses are small businesses in the
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
state yeah I think that would probably
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
be net negative but again I I think
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
given the fact that you do have so many
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
job openings out there at this given
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
moment this early on in the recovery
 
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
even if you do see job losses that are
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
substantial with your lower income
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
individuals I I think that they be able
 
00:52:31.789 --> 00:52:31.799 align:start position:0%
to simulate very quickly back into the
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
labor force uh given the fact that there
 
00:52:35.549 --> 00:52:35.559 align:start position:0%
is quite a bit of slack there but there
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
also is a very large need uh for labor
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
at this given moment but yes I I would
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
imagine if you go to $15 minimum wage
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to see Automation in a lot
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
of uh you know small businesses where
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
you can do that which would eliminate a
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
lot of those uh the lower paying jobs
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
that are out there but net net I do
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
think that you would see a rebound in
 
00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
the labor market fairly quickly should
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
that come to
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
fruition thanks for your
 
00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.270 align:start position:0%
fruition thanks for your
feedback

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative southw you have your
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
Aly uh I'm sorry but I think that our
 
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
hands didn't get taken
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
questions I don't I don't see any
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
further questions I mean uh this has
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
been a perfect presentation for what we
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
need at this point in time you brought
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
in the mix of the effect of the pandemic
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
which is a big
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
unknown I you told us
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
that if it's looking like the injections
 
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
are going to happen and what happens if
 
00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
if we meet a million a day and what
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
that'll do with the economy and you've
 
00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
given us an idea what if it doesn't do
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
that so we appreciate that so there's
 
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
been no further questions we thank you
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
very much thank you for having me on
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
yeah all right represented major there
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
is a hand up on the attendee side I
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
didn't know if you wanted to few minutes
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
that the uh can you bring that up for me
 
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
Jen because I don't see
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
G morning uh Norm this is uh Joe yeah
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
you uh Jeffrey I want to thank you uh
 
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
for uh helping us in this situation
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
ation I did have one question um there
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
recently there's been a move in the in
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
the price of the 10 year treasury so you
 
00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:09.799 align:start position:0%
know the the yield bottomed in uh the
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
spring um and then you know around 50
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
basis points and then in August started
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
to move from the low 50s and now we're
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
up at about um you know 1.10% on the
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
10year uh and obviously that has an
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
effect on um you know business's
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
borrowing costs and also mortgages etc
 
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
etc can you talk about um
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
the you know that phenomena how that
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
might affect um you know the economy and
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
also um the fed's um you know inability
 
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
to to uh you know control the uh Broad
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
water Bond markets please yeah a great
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
great question Joe so um obviously the
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
tenure has moved up 60 basis points
 
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
roughly from the lows um but if you
 
00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
think about other recessionary troughs
 
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
and the recoveries that have happened
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
10year treasury use usually moves up
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
closer to one and a half to 2% so even
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
though 60 basis points is you know
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
double from where we were back in April
 
00:56:19.029 --> 00:56:19.039 align:start position:0%
for example it's still low relative to
 
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
history and usually Rising long rates or
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
Rising 10e treasuries will have a bite
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
on iomic activity around 12 to 18 months
 
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
later um so it's one of the key reasons
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
why I think not only 2021 will be strong
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
but 2022 will be strong because again at
 
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
only a rise of 60 basis points that's
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
very moderate compared to what you've
 
00:56:40.589 --> 00:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
seen versus history now if you're going
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
to have GDP growth you know real GDP
 
00:56:45.789 --> 00:56:45.799 align:start position:0%
growth at 6% this year real GDP growth
 
00:56:47.309 --> 00:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
next year being close to four and a half
 
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:49.640 align:start position:0%
or or maybe even five um I think that
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
the tenear treasury will start to creep
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
higher over the course of this year um
 
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
but you're not really going to feel the
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
economic effects of that really until
 
00:56:59.230 --> 00:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
the middle part of 2022 maybe until the
 
00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
later part of that year as well but uh
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
again um it's very low compared to
 
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
history uh tene treasuries are one of
 
00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
the the biggest drivers of economic
 
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
activity and again this is one of the
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
again one of the core reasons why I'm
 
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
I'm fairly optimistic over the LA next
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
couple of years and speaking about the
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
FED uh and the response function one of
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
the key reasons why the 10year treasury
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't moved higher is because they
 
00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:22.839 align:start position:0%
moved to that average inflation
 
00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
targeting regime um signaling that
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
they're not intending to raise rates
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
over the next three or four years um so
 
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
you know that's kind of tethering the
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
10e down to these lower levels um but I
 
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
think as you see the the recovery unfold
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
here um and it does come in more strong
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
than consensus expectations I would
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
imagine that the tenure treasury is
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
going to continue to melt higher over
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
the course of this year reaching maybe
 
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:48.039 align:start position:0%
one and a half
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
1.75% by the end of 2021 but again with
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
that lag the fact you're really not
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
going to start to feel that economic
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
bite until a year or year and a half
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
later and and and one one thing I'll
 
00:58:02.029 --> 00:58:02.039 align:start position:0%
mention Joe is that the FED can tweak
 
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
their QE purchases if they wanted to
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
right now um you know they're doing 120
 
00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:08.039 align:start position:0%
billion per month 80 of which are
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
treasury purchases um if the 10e
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
treasury starts to rise dramatically
 
00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
from here uh and it's it's getting a
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
little disorderly similar to the taper
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
tantrum that you saw in
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
2013 the FED can tweak the composition
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
of those purchases to buy longer data
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
treasuries dur in the 10-year and trying
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
to to cap that and keep them lower I
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any real reason for
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
them to do that at this point as long as
 
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
the tene treasury rises in an orderly
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
fashion um and you don't see a taper
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
tantrum um I think the FED will keep
 
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
their asset purchases consistent with
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
what they've been doing recently but
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
again if it does start to move higher um
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
and it's uh getting to the point where
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
they're getting concerned that there is
 
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
some concerns about debt issuance and
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
the digestion of the all the debt that's
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
coming to the market this year um they
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
probably will tweak that composition to
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
keep long longer rates lower for longer
 
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
to help the economy and keep it
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
stimulative over the next couple of
 
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
years okay I want to say something here
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%

01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
um so I want to talk to you today a
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
little bit about New Hampshire's economy
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
um how New Hampshire's economy is
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
interacting with household finances and
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
has in the past particularly looking at
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
some of that uh economic recovery from
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
the uh last recession from the Great
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
Recession of 2007 to 2009 and what those
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
might mean for state revenues as well
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
and I should say um if there are
 
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
technical questions about particular
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
slides I'm happy to either uh take them
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
or as the over the course of the
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
presentation or go back to them um at
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
the end of the presentation of J major
 
01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll leave that up to you but I'm
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
happy to be interrupted if there's um if
 
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
there's a burning question about a
 
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.710 align:start position:0%
there's a burning question about a
particular

01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
slide um why don't we try that and if it
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
slowes now we'll have to wait till the
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
end of your presentation okay that's no
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
problem what whatever way um you believe
 
01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
works best um so just to talk a little
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
bit about the shock that we saw the
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
initial impact of the covid-19 crisis um
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
this graph shows New Hampshire's Gross
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
State product so when we think about the
 
01:01:57.069 --> 01:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
national economy you might think of
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
gross domestic product or GDP this is
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
scaled down to the state level what is
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
the Gross State product and this is
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
these are annualized numbers as well so
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
this is not this is if the economy was
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
the size that it was in each quarter
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
which is how the Bureau of economic
 
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
analysis reports it and these are
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
inflation adjusted numbers as well so
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
you can see this graph shows uh the
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
third quarter of 2010 to the third
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2020 and that uh that second
 
01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2020 where we saw that sort
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
of initial impact of the pandemic that
 
01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
the size of the economy in that quarter
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
was about the same that it was in early
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
2014 so obviously a major setback in
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
terms of economic growth in the state
 
01:02:39.269 --> 01:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
however we did see a rebound in uh the
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
third quarter of 2020 a very substantial
 
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
Rebound in terms of the overall size of
 
01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
the economy still back to about 2017
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
levels um these data will probably be
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
revised over time but I wanted to give
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
you a sense of you know in terms of the
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
total size of the economy What do the
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
impact looked like and it was even a
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
more dramatic impact in New Hampshire as
 
01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:00.039 align:start position:0%
it was around the country on employment
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
and I know you heard some from New
 
01:03:03.069 --> 01:03:03.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment security yesterday
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
um they dove into these numbers more
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
than I will but I wanted to provide a
 
01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
little bit of context relative to what
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
we saw in the Great Recession um of 2007
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
to 2009 you can see this graph goes back
 
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
to 2006 and it's uh the recession is
 
01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:16.990 align:start position:0%
to 2006 and it's uh the recession is
shaded

01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
shaded
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
there uh the a number of employed
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
residents in New Hampshire estimated
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
through these surveys uh did drop
 
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
relative significantly during the Great
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
Recession which of course was a major
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
economic event uh but if you continue to
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
follow that orange line you can see that
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
between the March survey and the April
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
survey the estimated number of New
 
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents employed dropped by
 
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
a little over 15,000 people and that's
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
very significant including especially
 
01:03:47.309 --> 01:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
given that we're talking about roughly
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
750,000 people employed uh who are
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
residents of the state now of course
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
there has been a fair bit of recovery um
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's been a pretty pretty dramatic
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
recovery really beating expectations uh
 
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
that a lot of folks had early on in the
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
crisis um and uh and that is a positive
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
sign I would do want to flag the
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
civilian labor force line as well that
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
blue line that we see here that's
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
counting the people who are employed or
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
or who are looking for work who are
 
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
unemployed but looking for work as
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
defined um by the Bureau of Labor
 
01:04:21.269 --> 01:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
Statistics and uh here we can see that
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
the civilian labor force has dropped
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
people have taken themselves out of the
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
out of the economy and out of the labor
 
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
force um and that number hasn't
 
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
increased as quickly we have yet to see
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
those uh December numbers for New
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um that may tell us a little
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
bit more um we saw there was a um uh in
 
01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
terms of the total number of people
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
employed there was a tick down in those
 
01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
December numbers nationally we don't
 
01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
know what um at least I don't know yet
 
01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
what the New Hampshire numbers are for
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
are at this point maybe New Hampshire
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
employment security offered you some
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
insight there yesterday um but you can
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
see that that civilian labor force
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
number it if that if that stays lower or
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
if that takes a longer time to recover
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
that does have some implications for the
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
economy that's likely because there are
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks who are you know staying
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
home to either avoid the virus
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
themselves or to take care of children
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
or older adults who might otherwise be
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
um be in a different setting and be
 
01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
cared for in a different setting but
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic they haven't
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
been able to be um or I I think there
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
may be some folks who are um who were
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
engaged in the labor force who lost
 
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
employment and who were either near or
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
couple years into what they considered
 
01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
retirement age maybe they're lucky
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
enough that they have the assets
 
01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
available to be able to retire so there
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
are questions in my mind around how many
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
of those people come back or how many
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
have uh um uh taken you know this time
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
this job loss as uh as the transition to
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
retirement if you will because we have a
 
01:05:45.789 --> 01:05:45.799 align:start position:0%
fair number of people in New Hampshire
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
who are in that sort of age bracket
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
where that's a choice they may be making
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
now I do want to note that the shock to
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
employment that we see here is not has
 
01:05:57.069 --> 01:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
not been evenly distributed across wage
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
groups so these are data that are um
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
that are based on private sector high
 
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
frequency data um that looking at jobs
 
01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
and particular jobs by wages and these
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
are data that are crunched by um
 
01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
researchers at Harvard and brown
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
universities and um they are in this
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
graph comparing what was employment in
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
high middle and low wage work in uh New
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in January relative to what it
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
is the graph goes through um um about
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
mid- October and here you can see that
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
high wage work which is that reddish
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
line um High wage work did dip
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
significantly but recovered by the time
 
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
we got to about late spring early summer
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
um and appears to be running a little
 
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
bit higher in terms of the number of
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
jobs that are high wage jobs available
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
uh middle wage work we could see had a
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
larger dip and a much longer recovery
 
01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
timeline and low wage work is still down
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
about 20% and uh that suggests that
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
people who were working in for examp
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
example a low-wage job or working
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
several low-wage jobs before the
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic so back in January some of
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
those folks may have moved to a middle
 
01:07:04.029 --> 01:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
or high wage job but many of them are
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
probably still looking for either one uh
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
low-wage job or a supplementary low-wage
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
job and they're not finding as many
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities because of what we see in
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
terms of what's what jobs are available
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
for them to enter into so that these
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
data anyway suggests that the the
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
economic impacts have been really uneven
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
in terms of um who's able to find
 
01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
employment and who's able to earn income
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
from employment and we see that a little
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
bit as well in New Hampshire employment
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
security data they've done an excellent
 
01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
job crunching numbers for us on a on a
 
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
weekly basis um and Publishing them in
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
terms of uh where unemployment claims
 
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
have been have come from on an industry
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
by industry basis and this graph shows
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
you the initial claims so that total
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
volume of initial claims this isn't you
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
know necessarily continuing claims so
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
these don't always uh represent what's
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
happening in these industries now but
 
01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
these initial claims are in those green
 
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
bars those these show the six highest in
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
initial claims totals by industry by
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
industry pardon me and the orange bars
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
beside it show the average weekly wage
 
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
in these industries that were paid in
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
2019 and uh the the line across the
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
middle is the average weekly wage um for
 
01:08:20.349 --> 01:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
all uh all workers in 2019 in New
 
01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and here you can see that um
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
all the way over on the left Food
 
01:08:26.829 --> 01:08:26.839 align:start position:0%
Services and drinking places has a very
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
high a number of initial claims much
 
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
higher than any other industry and also
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
a relatively low wage again these are
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
wages reported um through um New
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Employment Securities uh um
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
census of employed workers um so these
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
um uh covered employment wages pardon me
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
um it's called something different at
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
the federal level um so that industry is
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
an example of where we've probably seen
 
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who were previously um
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
low-wage workers
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
who are um uh who are still looking for
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
work or unable to find work uh social
 
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
assistance is another area where we see
 
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
you know fairly low wages and a fairly
 
01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
large number of job losses um there are
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
some other uh there are some other ones
 
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
here as well um that offer somewhat
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
higher wages but here are the industries
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
that we've seen the biggest impacts and
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
this has these impacts have had a fairly
 
01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
significant impact especially on low
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
wage and low asset um households uh we
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
can see that um if we if we look at a
 
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
survey that's conducted by the US Census
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau it's called the household pulse
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
survey it's conducted in every state the
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
survey has changed a little bit over
 
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
time but as of the last survey that
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
asked the question um which was in mid
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
July close to half of households in New
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had lost employment income
 
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
between March 13th and mid July that's a
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
very significant swath of households
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
that lost some form of employment income
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
that they would have been expecting
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
potentially over that time period about
 
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
one in three households looking at the
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
most recent survey data or the mid
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
December survey data about one in three
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
households in in New Hampshire indicated
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
it had been somewhat or very difficult
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
to pay for usual household expenses
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
during the prior seven days now we don't
 
01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
have data that mirrors that exactly from
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
the pre-pandemic uh era the household
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
pulse survey is something that's
 
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
happened only in 2020 and and sort of
 
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
post the pandemic um impacting uh
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
people's finances but um we do some
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
similar data that shows uh that asks a
 
01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
similar question that I'll get to a
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
little bit later um but shows that it's
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
likely a lower number um a sign a
 
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
substantially lower number and again
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
this is December this is not April and
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
May when we saw those highest um the
 
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
least amount of jobs um about a quarter
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
of respondents expected a loss of
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
household employment income in the next
 
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
four weeks and again that's of mid
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
December so that may um Express that may
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
show some anxiety around heading into
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
the winter months and uh losing some of
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
those employment opportunities are are
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
dependent in part on out being outside
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
and then 11% of households indicated
 
01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
they sometimes are often did not have
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
enough food to eat in the prior seven
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
days so again suggesting that family
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
budgets are being squeezed uh in a way
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
that does harm their ability to be food
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
secure so those are uh those numbers all
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
suggest that there's been a pretty
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
profound impact especially again at the
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
low end of the income Spectrum we see
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
that in Medicaid enrollment in New
 
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well Medicaid of course as
 
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
a state federal fiscal partnership uh
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
program that helps provide or helps
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
people with low incomes and limited
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
means generally access health coverage
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
and health health care and here we can
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
see that enrollment has increased
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
relatively significantly in New
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was declining as the economy
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
was improving over the course of 2019 we
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
get to the end of February and there
 
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
were about 179,000 people enrolled in
 
01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and but as of the end of
 
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
December the most recent numbers we have
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
it's gone up a little under 19% in terms
 
01:11:58.350 --> 01:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
of the total number of people who are
 
01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
enrolled in Medicaid now there are
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
certain eligibility criteria for
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh the federal government has
 
01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
as as part of their um part of one of
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
their earlier Aid packages has required
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
that people not be disenrolled from
 
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid even if they are no longer
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
income eligible um however we've seen
 
01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
this number continue to climb and there
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
was a little there was some research
 
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
done uh earlier in the pandemic in
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
Minnesota uh around how many people are
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
enrolled in Medicaid because they are
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
continuously income eligible or still
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
income eligible versus how many people
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
are were income eligible enrolled and
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
would no longer be income eligible in
 
01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
normal circumstances if you will and
 
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
they found that actually was a pretty
 
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
small percentage were the portion who uh
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
were income eligible at one point and
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
were still enrolled in the program even
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
though they wouldn't be in under normal
 
01:12:49.229 --> 01:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
policy if you will so that suggests that
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of this I mean obviously that's
 
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
Minnesota and earlier in the pandemic
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
but that suggest that a lot of this is
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
is it's probably a lot of people who
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
were near the income eligibility
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
threshold before and had but had
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
employment income that they no longer
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
have now um of course that's a program
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
that helps uh make people more
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
financially secure Medicaid is we've
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of federal action that has
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
really provided a very significant very
 
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
important income boost to the economy U
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
during um uh during calendar year 2020
 
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
so here this graph shows uh personal
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
income from different sources from
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
different sort of categories of sources
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
and I provided the first the four
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
quarters of 2019 to sort of give you
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
context as to what these swings look
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
like you can see in the second quarter
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
of 2020 the green bar which shows those
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
net earnings from work dropped quite
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
significantly uh but there were in that
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
orange bar transfer payments that really
 
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
did boost um uh Inc personal incomes and
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
those transfer payments uh are include
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
the federal enhanced unemployment comp
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
compensation benefits um the direct Aid
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
to individuals and for example those
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
$1,200 checks that were to provide
 
01:14:03.629 --> 01:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
relief to individuals those uh likely
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
pushed that number positive very
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
positive relative to the prior quarter
 
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
um in the second quarter of 2020 in the
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
third quarter of 2020 we see that net
 
01:14:14.629 --> 01:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
earnings from work did rebound it didn't
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
get quite back up to the levels that
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
were lost in the prior quarter but it
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
did increase um so there are probably a
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
fair number of low- wage jobs that are
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
that are included in that uh in that gap
 
01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
between the drop that we see and the
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
increase that we see in uh the third
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
quarter um but we also see that transfer
 
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
payments folded back a very significant
 
01:14:35.229 --> 01:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
amount from the prior quarter and again
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
that indicates that a lot of those um a
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
lot of those Federal actions were
 
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
designed to be temporary or were time
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
limited and That Was Then support the
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
economy didn't have going into the
 
01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
second half of 2020 again these numbers
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
do change they are revised um and we'll
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
see what the fourth quarter of 2020
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
looks like but that boost to economic
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
activity or that boost to resources
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
available to people in the economy uh is
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh is important action on the federal
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
side um and uh and is a difference from
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we saw prior to
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
the um during the recovery from the
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
Great Recession and let's go back and
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
look at that a little bit and where New
 
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sits in that recovery from the
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
Great Recession the prior conversation
 
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
there was a little bit noted about this
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so this graph shows the total gross
 
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
domestic product or gross State product
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
um at at the state level of the United
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
States as a whole in Green New Hampshire
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
in Orange and labeled you can see the
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
individual years of growth labeled and
 
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
then the remainder of the New England
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
states in blue and this is all pegged to
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
2005 so and inflation adjusted so it
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
shows the relative size of the economy
 
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
and you can see that New Hampshire
 
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
actually took a little while to grow uh
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
coming out to have faster economic
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
growth coming out of the last recession
 
01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
it lagged a little bit behind new its
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
New England neighbors and still is a
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
little bit behind where the United
 
01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
States is it wasn't really until 2014
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
2015 2016 that we saw that growth pick
 
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
up so again it was a delayed recovery
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
and particularly a delayed recovery in
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but the size of the
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
economy was overall larger when you get
 
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
to the 2017 2018 2019 certainly um in
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
inflation adjusted terms the economy was
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
bigger in New Hampshire than it was
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic prior to Pardon Me
 
01:16:24.629 --> 01:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
The Great Recession um but that wasn't
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
true for everyone's wages um this graph
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
shows the desiles really percentiles of
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh different parts of the wage Spectrum
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so the median wage is
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
at that 50th percentile and you can see
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
the dollar figure from the 2017 to 2019
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
data is about 20 half dollars an hour uh
 
01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
that um uh this shows the higher wages
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
so for example the 90th percentile only
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
10% of the wages are higher than than
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
that the 10th percentile only 10% of the
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
wages are lower than that this graph
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
compares the inflation adjusted 2004 to
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
2006 wages to the 2017 to 2019 wages and
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
this shows that again people with middle
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
people had consistently had middle wages
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
or lower wages didn't see much growth in
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
real purchasing power was about flat um
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of real purchasing power across
 
01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:19.719 align:start position:0%
that portion of the wage Spectrum even
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
if you even after the longest uh e the
 
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
longest period of economic growth that
 
01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
we have that we've calculated in US
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
history calculations go back to the
 
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
1850s um based on the national Bure of
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
economic research so that suggests that
 
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of people who weren't
 
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
able to contribute as much to the
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
economic growth that we were seeing
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
because their purchasing power was lower
 
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
than it was um prior to the Great
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
Recession um or only on par with it and
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
if you take these same data and break it
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
out by year it shows how many people
 
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
especially again uh lower wage earners
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
and middle wage earners had years during
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
the economic recovery where their
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
purchasing power was diminished over
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
time and that likely slowed the economic
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
recovery obviously there's some
 
01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
interaction between what we see in sort
 
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
of the Topline numbers and what we see
 
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
when we dig down into these numbers but
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
um but that likely slowed the economic
 
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
recovery consumers are you know 67% of
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh of all economic expenditures come
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
from personal consumption so if fewer
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
people have the resources available to
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
afford um buying goods and services that
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
slows the economy because that means
 
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
there's less there's less purchasing
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
power among more people in that um in
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
that important part of the P so again
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
you can see here in green um the figures
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
falling well below that 100 line which
 
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
is those inflation adjusted wages again
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
pegged to 2005 it wasn't until really in
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we saw the under 3% um
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate uh really putting
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
pressure on the labor market or or boo
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
helping boost wages uh to get to that
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
2017 2018 2019 boost that got people you
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
know back to about where they were in
 
01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
2005 and 2006 um but uh again that's
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
after a long period of economic recovery
 
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
and these wage boosts that we saw in the
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
low end of the income Spectrum um
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
there's probably some interaction as
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
well with another measure of household
 
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
well-being which is food insecurity um
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
these data come in a little bit of a
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
slower pace and we have to look at
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
threeyear averages to have enough data
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
to know what's going on in New Hampshire
 
01:19:30.669 --> 01:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
but here you can see the United States
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh in Green New England in blue and New
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in Orange and this is again
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
looking at that overall food insecurity
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
rate New Hampshire's is lower which is
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
great news it's excellent that we have
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
lower food insecurity um than the United
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
States as a whole um that being said if
 
01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
you start to look at about 2011 in 2012
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
you see that the food insecurity rate in
 
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
the United States as a whole started
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
dropping and started Dr dropping in a
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
steady fashion um again as part of the
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
economic recovery um but in New
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it didn't really start
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
dropping in a in a way that we could say
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
is statistically significant anyway
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
until you get to 2016 and Beyond and
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
looking at those sort of 2016 and Beyond
 
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
data and that corresponds with what we
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
saw at the low end of the wage Spectrum
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
so um again when we're talking about um
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
wages at the uh wages at the low end of
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
the income Spectrum in the middle of the
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
income Spectrum the sort of cascading
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
effects in terms of how households will
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
being in ability to afford goods and
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
services in the economy now looking at a
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
different data set that sort of um shows
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
the trends in another way this is median
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
household income with that orange
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
showing the inflation adjustment to the
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
most recent dollars the 2019 dollars
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
median household income in New Hampshire
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
you can see that it was climbing prior
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
to the Great Recession so we get to 2007
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
there's that sort of earlier Peak and
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
then there was a drop off and it took
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
until again we saw that sort of faster
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
economic growth
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
really after 2014 and into 2015 and 2016
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
um where we saw median house gold income
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
sort of bump back up and get back to
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
those pre uh recession levels and even
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
start to in 2019 exceed them a little
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
bit but again um it's not hasn't been a
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
continuous path and there was a period
 
01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
where a lot of people had less real
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
purchasing power again that probably
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
slowed the economic
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
recovery now um thinking about the
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
industry makeup thinking about where
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
some of these jobs have been lost and
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
where people have been earning income
 
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um there have been
 
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
there are some large industries that
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
have lower wages that are important
 
01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
Employers in New Hampshire and this is
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
important when we're thinking about
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
which Industries are going to come back
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
which Industries have been most affected
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
which Industries are um likely to help
 
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
the economic recovery the most or maybe
 
01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:43.639 align:start position:0%
lag behind the most and here you can see
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
in Orange is in the lighter orange is
 
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
retail trade and in the darker orange or
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
is accommodation in Food Services again
 
01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
industries that have lower average
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
weekly wages
 
01:21:56.669 --> 01:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
and um and those are important industry
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
sectors in the economy in New Hampshire
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
and these are again employment by 20 in
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
2019 Healthcare and social assistance is
 
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
the largest employer for a long time it
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
had been retail and Healthcare and
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
social assistance recently passed it
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
that Healthcare and social assistance
 
01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
obviously includes a very wide range of
 
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
um of wages depending on the job that
 
01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
someone is doing there's some very high
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
wages obviously and also some lower
 
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
wages um again depending on um uh exact
 
01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
what the p a person's role is or job is
 
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
within that
 
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
industry so one thing I want to note
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion of savings and
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
household Savings in the last
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
presentation um and it's great that in
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
aggregate households have been saving
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
more but there is some variation um and
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
one of the places where we see variation
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of people's ability to pay for
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
expenses going into this crisis people's
 
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
ability to weather this crisis is if you
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
look at data from just before the
 
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic it shows that a lot of
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
households likely didn't have a lot of
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
savings or didn't have a lot of ability
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
to pay their regular expenses so uh the
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
US Federal Reserve um system did conduct
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
a survey they've conducted several they
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
conduct an annual survey and they've
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
conducted several recently October 2019
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
was the one prior to the pandemic and it
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
found that 37% of us adults so this is
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
surveying the United States as a whole
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
um so close to 4 and 10 adults indicated
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
they would not pay for an unexpected
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
$400 expense with cash savings or a
 
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
credit card to be paid in full at the
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
end of the month so they likely had
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
limited enough assets that they were
 
01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
going to pay for an unexpected $400
 
01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
expense which could be you know an
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
alternator on a car that you need to get
 
01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
to work for example um with uh with
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
something other than cash savings or a
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
credit card uh that they would then be
 
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
able to avoid going into debt with so
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
they might be selling an asset um they
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
might be going into debt they might be
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
other you know otherwise unable to pay
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
it um indeed in that same survey in 2019
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
15% of us adults indicated they wouldn't
 
01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:53.639 align:start position:0%
be able to pay pay their bills in full
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
that month when they were asked and if
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
you uh add in in that same survey an
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
unexpected $400 expense that would uh
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
16% of the people who said they could
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
pay for their bills on October 2019
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
would then not be able to pay with an
 
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
unexpected $400 expense so a lot of
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
people really close to the margin and
 
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:17.719 align:start position:0%
again this is before the pandemic now a
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
similar survey in July of 2020 actually
 
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
found that people were more likely to be
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
able to use Liquid cash for unexpected
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
expenses so that likely reflects those
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
economic impact payments those $1,200
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
checks um as well as those enhanced
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
employment benefits so again providing
 
01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
support for the economy for people who
 
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
were um really close to the margin as it
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
is those are dollars that then get into
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
the economy and really likely helped
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
quite a bit um during calendar year 2020
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
um and hopefully will help again going
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
forward but um when we think about usual
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
household expenses there are a couple
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
different ways in terms of calculating
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
cost of living it's a it's sometimes a
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
challenging exercise but there are two
 
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
different calculators um that uh that
 
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
are um widely used one is the
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Institute of Technology um
 
01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
has a living wage calculator you can see
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
their graph on the left or their pie
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
chart on the left is for New Hampshire
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
as a whole and the economic policy
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
Institute family budget calculator on
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
the right is just for marac County they
 
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
don't provide a Statewide number um so I
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
picked sort of a Medi a county that's
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
closer to the middle if you will and
 
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and you can see on the left there's
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
two working adults with one child the
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
total uh the total cost the total
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
expenses uh or the total Co um income
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
needed to cover these expenses was about
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
$58,000 based on mit's calculations with
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
housing being the largest one and the
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
economic policy Institute looking at a
 
01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
similar array of costs they actually
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
found Transportation was a little bit
 
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
larger than housing but um so they're so
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
these two models are looking a little
 
01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
bit differently at Transportation costs
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
but um housing was again a very
 
01:25:57.629 --> 01:25:57.639 align:start position:0%
significant one and uh their total uh
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
income was about uh just shy of $770,000
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
to meet their their costs so again
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
there's some differences in calculation
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
but these are highers numbers that are
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
much higher than for example what many
 
01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
workers make um over the course of a
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
year um in some of these low wage
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
sectors so questions for the economy
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
going forward um and these are I think
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
key questions that you'll have to think
 
01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
about when you're um projecting uh State
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
revenues based in part on economic
 
01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
activity over the next uh two over the
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
next budget bium um one key question
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
that I have is Will workers be able to
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
rejoin the workforce efficiently um and
 
01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
that could be is there a job available
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
in the field that they were working in
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
before is there a job available in a
 
01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
different field that they are able to
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
adapt to are they able to rejoin um in
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
the field they were in before is it is
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
it safe right as the as the pandemic
 
01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully Fades away over time and we
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
get closer and closer to that herd
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
immunity um are people able to rejoin
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
the workforce are they are they safely
 
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
able to rejoin the workforce and if they
 
01:27:04.510 --> 01:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
can't rejoin the workforce in a in the
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
same field that they were in before are
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
there sufficient training or educational
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
opportunities that will enable them to
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
engage in a in a post-pandemic economy
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to look somewhat
 
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
different we don't exactly know how but
 
01:27:18.669 --> 01:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
are there are there opportunities for
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
them to um to again sort of rejoin in a
 
01:27:24.109 --> 01:27:24.119 align:start position:0%
way that is prod for them and and helps
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
helps the economy overall um will the
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
employment losses that we see um and the
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
income losses that we see resulting from
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
that lead to a more sort of regular
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
recession over time right now where we
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
have this sort of uneven recession that
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
is um that has been affected by um uh
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
what is ha we have this sort of uneven
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
recession that's been affected by sort
 
01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
of the disperate impacts in different
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
parts of the economy um will we see that
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
some of the income losses especially at
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
low and middle end of the income
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
Spectrum have those been completely
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
recovered for by both public sector
 
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
activity uh policy changes and at
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
private sector finding other income from
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
other places or will we see an economic
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
slowdown and you saw a little bit in the
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
last presentation about that as well
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
which was a little bit a little bit
 
01:28:13.109 --> 01:28:13.119 align:start position:0%
optimistic on that front um and I don't
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
mean optimistic in sort of in my
 
01:28:18.189 --> 01:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
judgment I mean that that's a positive
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
Pat you'll have to unmute
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
yourself um hey thank you great
 
01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:34.119 align:start position:0%
presentation um so my concern is that uh
 
01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
you know once her immunity is reached
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
and uh we're gonna have a rush to open a
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
lot of businesses restaurants hotels
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
theaters entertainment centers you name
 
01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
and even our ski areas have cut back um
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
not enough snow either but that's
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
another discussion but uh I'm concerned
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
that there's really not going to be my
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
real concern is there not going to be
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
enough workers to to fill all those jobs
 
01:28:58.750 --> 01:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
and that there'll be an upward pressure
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
there will indeed be a natural upward
 
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:01.719 align:start position:0%
pressure on
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
wages uh I think I think I think the
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
lower level people are actually going to
 
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
benefit from that uh rages will go up
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
but do you think that not enough workers
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
are there to be an anchor to recovery
 
01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:17.870 align:start position:0%
are there to be an anchor to recovery
Total

01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
Total
 
01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:20.229 align:start position:0%
Total
Recovery

01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
Recovery
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so um one of one of my so I
 
01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
agree I think that is a concern and I
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
think those concerns are driven in part
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
by long-term demographics in New
 
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that um that I I don't think
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
the to my knowledge the fundamentals
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
haven't changed as a result of this
 
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic we have seen more people moving
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
to the state um so that might affect it
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
some uh but those long-term demographics
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
are still exist and are still there
 
01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:45.719 align:start position:0%
still part of the picture here in New
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so I think again I think
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
that this is where um having
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people to uh enter the
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
workforce investing in people who might
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise be marginally attached to the
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
workforce so that um they you should
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
they choose to and should uh employers
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
be able to find them right be um be sort
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
of more full-fledged engagers if you
 
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
will in the workforce there are a lot of
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
folks who are um who have been on the
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
peripheries and we see we saw during
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
this economic recovery the tail end of
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
the economic recovery from the Great
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
Recession sort of more and more people
 
01:30:19.709 --> 01:30:19.719 align:start position:0%
coming into the labor force over time
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
more than many economists expected
 
01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.510 align:start position:0%
more than many economists expected
frankly

01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
so my hope would be that there would be
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
a combination of sort of that effect of
 
01:30:29.229 --> 01:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
investing in people who are otherwise
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
sort of marginally attached to the labor
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
force um really getting them the the
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
training and opportunities that they
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
might not otherwise have um and um and
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
benefiting from their engagement in
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
labor force as well as maybe some
 
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
immigration um and uh and I my hope is
 
01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
that because this is sort of such a
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
swift economic event if we start to see
 
01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
this unemployment rate the unemployment
 
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
rate continue to track or if we continue
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
to see the unemployment rate contract
 
01:30:58.109 --> 01:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
and Shrink um in New Hampshire in
 
01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
particular at such a fast rate that um
 
01:31:03.149 --> 01:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
that a lot of Institutions right both
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
educational institutions and employers
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
will remember the um the sort of
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
Workforce constraints that we saw
 
01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
immediately prior to the pandemic in New
 
01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will be sort of freshen
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
everyone's minds and there will be more
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
sort of there'll be more opportunities
 
01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
for coordination retraining and efforts
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
to make it so that people who are either
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
marginally attached to the labor force
 
01:31:25.629 --> 01:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
or otherwise have have not received the
 
01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
you know educational Investments have
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
not received the training opportunities
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
that they have in the past um that there
 
01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
there will be more of those equ
 
01:31:33.229 --> 01:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities there will be more of
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
those Investments and that will get more
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
people into the labor force to help
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
address that concern because I think it
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
is a real one going forward okay we'll
 
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
take three more questions and then you
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
can continue from next is Senator
 
01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
Ros thank you Mr chairman Phil um
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
through the middle of October
 
01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has received about $85
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
million in additional Federal Medicaid
 
01:32:02.669 --> 01:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
funds that's
 
01:32:08.109 --> 01:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
6.2% extra fmap do you have any estimate
 
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
of what we might expect to receive
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
through the end of the
 
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
biennium yeah unfortunately Senator
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald it's a great question and one
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
of the key ways in which the federal
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
government has provided support to uh to
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's budget it certainly l
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
far um I don't have an estimate for the
 
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
through the end of the bium my
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
understanding um of of that additional
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
fmap increase that an enhanced Medicaid
 
01:32:33.109 --> 01:32:33.119 align:start position:0%
match is uh it is dependent on the
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
federal Public Health Emergency um so I
 
01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
don't know how long that's going to last
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh But whichever as long as some part of
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
the quarter is covered by federal Public
 
01:32:44.109 --> 01:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
Health the federal Public Health
 
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
Emergency then that enhanced fmap
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
applies to that um to those quarterly
 
01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
payments that are made um through the
 
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
federal medic program but unfortunately
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
I don't have a number to to estimate
 
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
that Senator
 
01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
Hennessy thank you Mr chair uh Phil
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I my
 
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
question I believe it was on page four
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
you had a very interesting graph that
 
01:33:05.719 --> 01:33:07.870 align:start position:0%
you had a very interesting graph that
showed

01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
showed
 
01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:09.430 align:start position:0%
showed
um

01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
the uh yes the low wage the middle wage
 
01:33:15.149 --> 01:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
and the high wage have you ever looked
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
at this with the with an overlay of the
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
jobs that are available in these three
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
different categories and the changes in
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
them because the reason I ask is that I
 
01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
mean just from um employers contacting
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
me but also just reading any newspaper I
 
01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
see a lot of jobs available is it and
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
and I just would like to get your
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
opinion on that see if you've done that
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
before right so there may be there may
 
01:33:42.189 --> 01:33:42.199 align:start position:0%
be some interaction between what we're
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
seeing here in terms of the in terms of
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
employment changes and what we're seeing
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
in um changes in the civilian labor
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
force right um so I think that there is
 
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
I think that part of this mismatch that
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
we see or part of this um mismatch
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
between you know some jobs are available
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
and there aren't they don't appear to be
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
workers available for them and there are
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
some workers who would prefer to be
 
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
earning income in the economy and aren't
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
um aren't able to find work or seeing
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
that you know the low wage job sectors
 
01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
obviously are a ways down um I think
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
some of that mismatch is why it's really
 
01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
important to um have have sort of an
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
intentional process of being able to
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh take folks who either have received
 
01:34:25.950 --> 01:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
you know less investment in terms of
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
training in terms of education and
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
connecting them to job opportunities um
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
I think because I agree I think that
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
there is some of that and there was some
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
of that prior to the or pardon me in the
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
aftermath of the Great Recession as well
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
there was some um employment mismatch um
 
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
and there's questions around how much of
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
that is cyclical and how much of that is
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
structural and it's something that's
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
actually been a fair bit of research
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
around of in the recovery from the Great
 
01:34:53.709 --> 01:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
recession it's hard to say because this
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
economic shock is so different exactly
 
01:34:57.390 --> 01:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
what that's going to look like in the
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
recovery here um and because it's such a
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
shorter time horizon or potentially
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
hopefully a shorter time Horizon than
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession but um but I think
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
that I think that you you do raise a key
 
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
question around why are we seeing these
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
sort of um these sort of different
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
experiences um and I think that once we
 
01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
once the the sort of natural disaster
 
01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
portion of this recession right the
 
01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic of this recession subsides then
 
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
we'll see a little bit more about how
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
that shakes out I think it's a hard
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
question to answer at this point um so
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry that those are the best
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts I have for you at this point
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
Senator henness thank you okay then
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
there'll be representa taka followed by
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
Senator guer and then we'll hold the
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
questions until um Phil finishes because
 
01:35:47.070 --> 01:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
he has 17 more slides to do after that
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
so representative Tucker thank you Mr
 
01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being with us
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
today uh I didn't see in your comments
 
01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
or your slides the apparent differences
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
in how the this uh crisis has affected
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
women and how it's affected men and the
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
role of child care
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
preschool uh and generally education
 
01:36:19.629 --> 01:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
plays into that and perhaps perhaps you
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
have slides later about that
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
um but I think that's something that's
 
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
really quite different than prior uh
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
recessions or the Great Recession and I
 
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
wondered if you could comment on that
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
sure yeah and it is absolutely different
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
um than what we saw during the Great
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
Recession um during the Great Recession
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
um the majority of people who are
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
applying for uh unemployment assistance
 
01:36:49.229 --> 01:36:49.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire were men um and in the
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
first three months of the pandemic if
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
you will or this the second quarter of
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2020 um the New Hampshire
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
employment security reported that about
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
59% of the people applying for
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation were women um
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
and so that's a pretty massive shift
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
this is a again A A recession that is
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
more focused on the service sectors in
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
the economy some of the pardon me some
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
of the um sectors that more
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
traditionally employ women or tend to
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
employ higher percentages of women
 
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
rather than men um and we've seen that
 
01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:23.719 align:start position:0%
nationally there's been some research
 
01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
around who is dropping out of the labor
 
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
force so again that's back to this um uh
 
01:37:30.669 --> 01:37:30.679 align:start position:0%
back to this uh the blue line here
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
showing why are people not in the labor
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
force and we've seen some research that
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
suggest that not only women but women
 
01:37:40.109 --> 01:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
with children are more likely to have
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
dropped out of the labor force um than
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
than not only men but women without
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
children as well so that suggests
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a child care
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
component here there's definitely a
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
component where as it's safe to reopen
 
01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
schools will we see more people rejoin
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
the labor force we see more women with
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
children able to rejoin the labor force
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
um so that has that's sort of the um the
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
upshot when it comes to how how some of
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
these uh metrics might move and what it
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
might do with the for the economy that
 
01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
being said there's a lot of people a lot
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
of women with children uh in particular
 
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
based on based on the statistics we've
 
01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
seen who who dropped out of the labor
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
force who weren't able to engage in
 
01:38:20.589 --> 01:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
employment um that has ramifications for
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
their career in the long term and their
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
earning potential and their ability to
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
engage in the economy in the long term
 
01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
as well um and I think that that's an
 
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
important consideration going forward
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
especially when we look at the economy
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
um for you for the next years in the
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
gerer thank you Mr chairman uh Phil good
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
presentation as always uh you go back to
 
01:38:45.790 --> 01:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
that slide that you uh pulled up
 
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
initially for Senator Hennessy that
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
show so my question is is of those three
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
brackets do do you have any numerical or
 
01:38:59.950 --> 01:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of the workforce numbers for
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
those brackets is particularly those
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
that did not participate in the in the
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
economic Prosperity that lower bracket
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so New Hampshire in New Hampshire
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so for these numbers for New
 
01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't have those but I can
 
01:39:13.709 --> 01:39:13.719 align:start position:0%
see if I can find those in those in this
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
research for you sendor guide and send
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
those along as well um but they we do
 
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
see so we know what the incomes are and
 
01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
these These are based on what was what
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
these jobs paid in 2019 um the incomes
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
are for the high wager greater than
 
01:39:30.430 --> 01:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
60,000 27,000 to 60,000 in the middle
 
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
and then low wage is less than $27,000
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
so um again you know median household
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
income in New Hampshire we know in 2019
 
01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
was about 75,000 but that's a household
 
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
that's again roughly two and a half
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
people um so uh the median in terms of
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
the median wage and jobs I would um I
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
would want to go back and match up those
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
numbers with you as opposed to match up
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
those numbers and provide them to you um
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to um as opposed to trying to
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
remember them off the top of my head but
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
I can provide those to um to both
 
01:40:01.390 --> 01:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
committees all right just by way of
 
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
quick commentary Mr
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
chairman the the the women with children
 
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
component that is not recovering I think
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
is largely due to the school issue where
 
01:40:12.189 --> 01:40:12.199 align:start position:0%
we have many of our schools going hybrid
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
or remote completely intermittently and
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
the child care issue is a huge one thank
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
you okay well why don't you continue
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
Phil Right absolutely Ely um so uh so
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
some more questions for the economy
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
going forward and we actually already
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
covered a fair number of these questions
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
um I do think additional Federal action
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
will be a key consideration um and how
 
01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
how does that affect the economy overall
 
01:40:36.589 --> 01:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
how does the effect the ability of
 
01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
residents to make ends meet themselves
 
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
obviously there's an interaction there
 
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
with the broader economy um what role
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
will the State play in supporting the
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
economic recovery um there are a lot of
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
State services that are provided that
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
are pretty key for people to be able to
 
01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
not only invest in their Education and
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
Training but also um uh also uh make
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
sure that they stay in their homes and
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
um uh and have resources going forward
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
um what happens to the international
 
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
economy and what happens to trade as a
 
01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
result of that uh even as we advance
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
towards H herd immunity hopefully over
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
the course of this year uh in New
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in the United States um
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
what happens in terms of uh in terms of
 
01:41:20.109 --> 01:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
international trade impacts uh and Inter
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
and ational economic interactions and
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
other forms that affects what the
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
economy looks like going forward for
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
over many years um we may not get to
 
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
herd immunity in a lot of places if you
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
will um uh for for many years to come it
 
01:41:37.390 --> 01:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
really depends on the vaccine roll out
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
the vaccine availability the um the
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
Investments made in countries that are
 
01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to invest in
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
themselves um in the same way in terms
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
of buying vaccines for large spats of
 
01:41:49.629 --> 01:41:49.639 align:start position:0%
their population so I think that's a
 
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
question going forward
 
01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
also what happens in the post-pandemic
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
economy to commercial property values um
 
01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
what happens to how businesses organize
 
01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
themselves geographically what happens
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
to tourism there may be less
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
International tourism that might
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
actually help New Hampshire if more
 
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
people are engaging in tourism locally
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
we did see some of that during 2020 um
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
what and so there are many other areas
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
where I think there are questions like
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
this so I want to shift to talking a
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
little bit about State revenues um I
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
think understanding that you're going to
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
looking to project State revenues into
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
the next budget bium um I want to look
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
back a little bit and note that we've
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
had a dramatic improvements in these
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
forecasts especially since the last time
 
01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
I um I was presenting to members of the
 
01:42:35.709 --> 01:42:35.719 align:start position:0%
House Ways and Means Committee um the
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
these are the forecasts for State fiscal
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
year 2021 over several different
 
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
iterations um we can see that in May and
 
01:42:44.189 --> 01:42:44.199 align:start position:0%
June both the state agencies and the
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
house ways in Means Committee had
 
01:42:49.149 --> 01:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
estimates for 2021 of a you know maybe
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
low 200 to high High $300 million
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
shortfall in the general and education
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
trust funds obviously a very significant
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
number um in July and September the
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
state agencies sort of folded back those
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
forecasts a little bit to around $240
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
million and in November they presented
 
01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
to all of you some of the um some of the
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
updated forecasts which total between a
 
01:43:12.669 --> 01:43:12.679 align:start position:0%
4 million and a 76 pardon me million
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
dollar shortfall in the general and
 
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
education trust funds obviously a much
 
01:43:19.149 --> 01:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
more manageable number and we've seen
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
that these forecasts of as they've
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
changed over time reflect our you
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
reflect our understanding of the sort of
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
economic crisis that we're in um again
 
01:43:29.229 --> 01:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
the the modeling based on employment
 
01:43:32.189 --> 01:43:32.199 align:start position:0%
early in 2020 was suggesting some very
 
01:43:33.870 --> 01:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
significant shortfalls but we've seen
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
this recession behave quite differently
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
and we see that in the actual revenues
 
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
as well so these are the actual revenues
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
on a cash basis to the general and
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
education trust funds for the uh for
 
01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
each month of calendar year 2020 you can
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
see State fiscal year 2020 is on the
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
left side and state fiscal year 2021 on
 
01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
the right and you see that dip the that
 
01:43:59.709 --> 01:43:59.719 align:start position:0%
drop associated with um the initial
 
01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
impacts of the pandemic we very we had
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
saw very significant revenue losses in
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
some of those months relative to the
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
state budget plan which is that zero
 
01:44:10.109 --> 01:44:10.119 align:start position:0%
line but we've seen since then and thus
 
01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
far in state fiscal year 2021 revenues
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
not only doing better than was expected
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
based on what we were seeing in the
 
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic but also better than was
 
01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
expected in the state budget plan um and
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimates that were put
 
01:44:25.709 --> 01:44:25.719 align:start position:0%
together in September of
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
2019 well before the pandemic so it's
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's really actually remarkable and if
 
01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
we look at we if we look at a little bit
 
01:44:35.229 --> 01:44:35.239 align:start position:0%
more historical context for General and
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
education trust fund revenues overall
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
this graph shows the three-month rolling
 
01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
averages relative to the prior year and
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
the percent changes there and we can see
 
01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
that some of that faster economic growth
 
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
helped in 2014 and 2015 and really
 
01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
started showing up in the revenues in
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
2015 and 2016 we see the um the next
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
sort of Rise that you see that's labeled
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
there is the result of the December 2017
 
01:45:01.589 --> 01:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
tax cuts and jobs act a lot of companies
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
were repatriating um a lot of
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
multinational companies were
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
repatriating dollars from
 
01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
overseas those dollars some of those
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
were captured by the business profits
 
01:45:12.669 --> 01:45:12.679 align:start position:0%
tax base those were expected to be
 
01:45:15.589 --> 01:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
one-time funds so we expected to see a
 
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
drop off after that we obviously saw a
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
relatively precipitous drop again you
 
01:45:22.589 --> 01:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
see the bottom Spike on there is uh the
 
01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the NAT if you will of the whole
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
graph is what's happened in the first
 
01:45:31.149 --> 01:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
half of calendar year 2020 um however in
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
the second half and into State fiscal
 
01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
year 2021 we've seen revenues not only
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
rebound from that but also again be
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
higher than they were the year before
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
higher than revenues in the second half
 
01:45:44.589 --> 01:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
of 2020 being higher than they were in
 
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
the second half of 2019 again talking
 
01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
about calendar years there so it's
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
really substantial and and why might
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
this be what are some of the things that
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
have contributed to this um that might
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
you know talking about that might help
 
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
inform what we see going forward so here
 
01:46:04.109 --> 01:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
the revenue source that has taken the
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
largest hit and is the second largest
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
tax revenue Source the state actually
 
01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
collects um is the meals and rentals tax
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
um the meals and rentals tax obviously
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
was impacted in April and May you can
 
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
see those actual numbers in Orange in
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
May um the the projections produced by
 
01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
the state uh the state agencies on a
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
looking at a monthly basis you can see
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
um that the Department of Revenue
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
Administration expected it to dip a
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
little bit more than it actually did in
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
the summer there was a fair bit of
 
01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
innovation and a lot of businesses were
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
um especially um restaurant me
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
restaurants which are 80% of the tax
 
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
based here um we're we're innovating and
 
01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
finding ways to get consumers in the
 
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
doors um you can see the next set of
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
projections in November um which are
 
01:46:47.709 --> 01:46:47.719 align:start position:0%
borne out thus far in the December data
 
01:46:49.589 --> 01:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
um don't suggest suggest this will
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
continue to add to the budget deficit as
 
01:46:53.229 --> 01:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
opposed to the Surplus relative to what
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
was in the state budget plan again that
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
$ Z
 
01:46:59.629 --> 01:46:59.639 align:start position:0%
line um cigarette sales have been much
 
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
higher than expected and that's
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
something that we see again higher than
 
01:47:05.629 --> 01:47:05.639 align:start position:0%
even the state revenue plan that's
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
something that's expected to continue
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
going forward through the rest of this
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal year again from the Department of
 
01:47:13.629 --> 01:47:13.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration um that is driven
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
maybe in part by people smoking more um
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
if there's greater stressers out there
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
which there are um uh in part by crossb
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
sales because of policy changes in
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that I believe Dr spoke
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
about yesterday um and it may some of
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
that may be people stocking up as well
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
not knowing what's going to happen um
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know in the next month or two
 
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
related to the pandemic real estate
 
01:47:36.669 --> 01:47:36.679 align:start position:0%
sales and I know you're going to hear
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
from Ben Frost later today real estate
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
sales have uh rebounded in a way that it
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
was not expected um usually this moves
 
01:47:46.589 --> 01:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
with the economy more generally again
 
01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
we're seeing these uneven economic
 
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
impacts so um the actual
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
um is quite a bit higher than what was
 
01:47:54.189 --> 01:47:54.199 align:start position:0%
planned and what was projected earlier
 
01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
in the year and uh and the question in
 
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
my mind around this the real key
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
question is what happens with inventory
 
01:48:03.550 --> 01:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
um both sales volume and sales values
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
are up for single family homes relative
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
to the prior year which was already a
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
hot market and with little inventory so
 
01:48:10.830 --> 01:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
what happens with inventory going
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
forward was I think be really important
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
here um the hur's interest in dividends
 
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
tax um also has seen um re has been
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
generating Revenue sort of above
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
expectations suggesting that for folks
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
who have significant assets and who are
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
paying interest in dividends tax uh um
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire um we're seeing that
 
01:48:31.950 --> 01:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
those assets are are generating Revenue
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
not that far off from plan in recent
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
months and again there was a filing
 
01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
deadline shift so that's why we see a
 
01:48:39.149 --> 01:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
little bit of that um seawing if you
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
will um but those are still holding up
 
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
in a way that you might not expect in
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
sort of a regular
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
recession and then business taxes have
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
been the primary driver of what we see
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
as the revenue Surplus so far this
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um and uh and the Department
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
of Revenue Administration again these
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
are these are performing better than
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
expected better than we would see in a
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
regular recession the Department of
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration has noted that
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
there are some businesses that are doing
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
well and some businesses that are doing
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
poorly again it's a really sort of
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
uneven and not typical recession um but
 
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
also that large businesses are doing
 
01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
relatively well and are doing better
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
than was expected um and we heard in a
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
little bit in the last presentation
 
01:49:21.550 --> 01:49:21.560 align:start position:0%
about about corporate profit as well um
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
and those large businesses are an
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
important part of the picture so this uh
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
table is derived from uh um data um
 
01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
produced by the Department of Revenue
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
Administration uh this is the business
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
profits tax base for ta for tax year
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
2018 um looking at the different uh size
 
01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
businesses in terms of their taxable
 
01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
profits under the New Hampshire business
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
profits tax you can see that over on
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
that left-hand column tax year 2018 is
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
the most recent year we have these data
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
for so um you can see the cumulative
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
percentage that pay that has taxable
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
business profits of at least that number
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
on the left hand column um in that
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
middle column you can see that
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
cumulative percentage of filers and you
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
can see the cumulative percentage of
 
01:50:05.709 --> 01:50:05.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue paid on the right so if we look
 
01:50:07.950 --> 01:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
just at the Top Line you'll see that for
 
01:50:10.589 --> 01:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
businesses that uh had taxable profits
 
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
attributable to New Hampshire after a
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
portion M of at least 12.6 million that
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
was actually was about it was 76
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
businesses is that on10th of a percent
 
01:50:23.109 --> 01:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
of filers and those businesses paid
 
01:50:25.229 --> 01:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
close to half of the total business
 
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
profits tax that was collected so the
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
reason I'm showing you this table is to
 
01:50:32.189 --> 01:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
emphasize how important those large
 
01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
businesses are for understanding what is
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
happening with business profits tax
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
revenue another way to emphasize that is
 
01:50:43.149 --> 01:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
um if we look at the filers by type um
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
by type of business um Proprietors which
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
could include you know sole Proprietors
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
and uh so self-employed individuals um
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
make up the largest share of filer types
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
and you can see corporations and
 
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
Partnerships are also significant as
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
well that orange slice are Water's Edge
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
filers so um uh a a type of combined
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
reporting that generally reflects
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
multi-state and Multinational businesses
 
01:51:08.109 --> 01:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
they made up about 6% of filers but
 
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
keeping the colors the same in terms of
 
01:51:12.669 --> 01:51:12.679 align:start position:0%
the revenue that was paid they made up
 
01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
62% of all the revenue so again what are
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
typically large multi-state
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
multinational businesses are really
 
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
important part of tax base now I'll note
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
this was tax year 2018 so these numbers
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
are they're most recent numbers they're
 
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit higher because of
 
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
some of that repatriation but even if
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
you look at tax year 2017 it was about
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
57% or 57 or 58% so again the largest
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
businesses are key part of the business
 
01:51:39.310 --> 01:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
profit tax
 
01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:42.679 align:start position:0%
base um the uh business Enterprise tax
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
base is a little bit more distributed so
 
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
you can see to get to about half of the
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
revenue collected through that you have
 
01:51:51.149 --> 01:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
to get to the top8 % of businesses in
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
terms of their business Enterprise tax
 
01:51:55.629 --> 01:51:55.639 align:start position:0%
base as opposed to the top Point uh
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
.1% um so that gives you a little bit a
 
01:51:59.830 --> 01:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
sense of how the business Enterprise tax
 
01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
interacts a little differently and the
 
01:52:03.870 --> 01:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax is also one
 
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
where um we see that the top income
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
earners are really important to
 
01:52:09.229 --> 01:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
understanding what's going to happen
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
with interest and dividends tax revenues
 
01:52:14.189 --> 01:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
so for example people earning two or
 
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
filers I should say people are or um
 
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
joint filers generally um who are
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
earning $200 ,000 or more in just
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
interest in dividend income so this is
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
in interest and dividend income Alone um
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
paid about half of the interest and
 
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
dividends tax um again a little under
 
01:52:32.030 --> 01:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
half in tax year
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
2018 but while we're talking about these
 
01:52:35.709 --> 01:52:35.719 align:start position:0%
important state taxes however and they
 
01:52:38.350 --> 01:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
are pretty key to State finances it's
 
01:52:40.589 --> 01:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
important to remember that of state and
 
01:52:43.109 --> 01:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
local taxes collected the property tax
 
01:52:45.149 --> 01:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
collected and expended at the local
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
level dwarfs a lot of these individual
 
01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
state taxes so you could see the five
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
largest state tax revenue sources in uh
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 2020 um not counting
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
the Statewide education property tax
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
because that's raised and retained
 
01:53:00.629 --> 01:53:00.639 align:start position:0%
locally so that's added on to that local
 
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
property tax levy again much more
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
significant than even our largest uh
 
01:53:08.350 --> 01:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
state level tax the business profits tax
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
so I think questions uh for the future
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
relative to revenues in the economy will
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
a more sort of regular recession happen
 
01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
and will it lead to a general slowdown
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
in revenues as opposed to the sort of
 
01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
disperate impact that we've seen seen
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
this disperate impact different in
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
different sectors has meant that sectors
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
that happen to match some key state
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
revenue sources for New Hampshire like
 
01:53:30.750 --> 01:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
large corporations have actually been
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
performing well will they continue to
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
perform well and it could be that they
 
01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
very well may that's just a question of
 
01:53:39.550 --> 01:53:39.560 align:start position:0%
how does what's happening in the economy
 
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
and in different sectors of the economy
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
interact with our tax bases in New
 
01:53:45.790 --> 01:53:45.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um do slower wage growth has
 
01:53:47.229 --> 01:53:47.239 align:start position:0%
happened during the last recession limit
 
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
State revenues um it could be that we
 
01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
don't see that SL lower wage growth it
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
could be that we do that's something
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
that I think is important to watch for
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
and consider are there long-term
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
International Trade impacts that affect
 
01:53:58.990 --> 01:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
business of profits tax revenues in
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
particular I think that's a key question
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
um do restaurants recover and in
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
particular do they recover in commercial
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
areas I'm thinking of some of our
 
01:54:08.830 --> 01:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
downtowns in New Hampshire um that could
 
01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
be that there is not the same sort of
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
recovery there in terms of people going
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
out to lunch whatever it may be um and
 
01:54:16.109 --> 01:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
then what happens to both residential
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
and commercial property values we may
 
01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
see them Go in different directions
 
01:54:21.069 --> 01:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
commercial property values I think are a
 
01:54:22.750 --> 01:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
big question mark going forward and what
 
01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
are the implications for pressure on
 
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
local property tax revenues so some key
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
takeaways the covid-19 crisis had a
 
01:54:32.189 --> 01:54:32.199 align:start position:0%
Swift and massive impact it had the most
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
severe effects on those with the fewest
 
01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
resources um there are pretty Stark
 
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
differences relative to what we would
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
see in a regular recession there's not
 
01:54:41.310 --> 01:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
this General slowdown it's a little bit
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
more varied um and federal assistance
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
played a really important impact in the
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
2020 economy being as good as it was
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
given the conditions um and given some
 
01:54:54.750 --> 01:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
of the other indicators that we see and
 
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's true in New Hampshire too pardon
 
01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
me and tax revenues from businesses
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
tobacco products and real estates have
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
done surprisingly well but the uneven
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
impacts of the crisis have been clear in
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
those revenue streams um and larger
 
01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
businesses higher income earners and
 
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
property markets and values are going to
 
01:55:13.069 --> 01:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
be important for Key State and
 
01:55:14.589 --> 01:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
particularly that last one local Revenue
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
sources as well I think there is some
 
01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
risk that this uneven slow wage growth
 
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
and uneven industry impacts hinder a
 
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
robust Equitable and sustainable
 
01:55:24.750 --> 01:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
recovery and that may be a way that we
 
01:55:27.069 --> 01:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
don't see in the Topline numbers as well
 
01:55:28.750 --> 01:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
like the Topline numbers May mask some
 
01:55:31.149 --> 01:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
of that um uh some of that unevenness in
 
01:55:33.870 --> 01:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
the recovery so I'm happy to take any
 
01:55:35.229 --> 01:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
questions I know I only have a couple
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
minutes left um but I appreciate the
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
questions partway through and I know
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
this is a lot of material um I'm happy
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
to talk you through any any bit of it
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
that you'd
 
01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
like okay uh question from
 
01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:48.589 align:start position:0%
like okay uh question from
representative

01:55:48.589 --> 01:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
alme thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
Phil we've just gone to Mar market-based
 
01:56:00.189 --> 01:56:00.199 align:start position:0%
sourcing in the business profits tax and
 
01:56:03.629 --> 01:56:03.639 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax uh and we
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
are about to go next year to single
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
sales factor which I think could have a
 
01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
much larger impact have you looked at
 
01:56:16.990 --> 01:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
all at what the waterers Edge and the
 
01:56:20.350 --> 01:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
other large corporations do in terms of
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
their sales to the exterior of the state
 
01:56:26.669 --> 01:56:26.679 align:start position:0%
which is what single sales Factor would
 
01:56:29.229 --> 01:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
not tax yeah and I think that's an
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
excellent question and an excellent
 
01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
point I think that um single sales
 
01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
Factor does uh introduce the prospect of
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps more volatility with changes in
 
01:56:40.990 --> 01:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
the economy I haven't been able to look
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
and see uh what the uh especially the
 
01:56:47.069 --> 01:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge uh reporters um have in
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
terms of the breakdown of single sales
 
01:56:52.109 --> 01:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
Factor versus the the three factors um
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
so I think that's an excellent question
 
01:56:55.629 --> 01:56:55.639 align:start position:0%
um I imagine that Dr would be able to
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
dig into those numbers much more deeply
 
01:56:58.990 --> 01:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
than I can based on the information that
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
they have available um but I I I think
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's a key
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
consideration I'm sorry I don't have a
 
01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
Bry Patrick you gonna have to unmute
 
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.790 align:start position:0%
Bry Patrick you gonna have to unmute
yourself

01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
did it again thanks thanks Phil um it
 
01:57:25.629 --> 01:57:25.639 align:start position:0%
seems to be there seems to be a lot of
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
wealth moving into New Hampshire given
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
the increases in the red and we know
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
that the it's really putting upward
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
pressure on the uh housing prices uh so
 
01:57:36.990 --> 01:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
do you think there's a correlation there
 
01:57:38.510 --> 01:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
with what may happen with interest in
 
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
dividends because those wealthy people
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
will have Investments that will be
 
01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
taxed um or do you think that's even uh
 
01:57:49.870 --> 01:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh will move the needle at all um it it
 
01:57:52.109 --> 01:57:52.119 align:start position:0%
could very well move the needle um if we
 
01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
are if we look at the migration data and
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
find that we're talking about many more
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
thousands of people moving to New
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um if you were to make
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
some assumption about how many of those
 
01:58:04.629 --> 01:58:04.639 align:start position:0%
people are really high wealth
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
individuals that again drive that
 
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax base um it
 
01:58:10.830 --> 01:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
could move the needle on that front
 
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
again remember there were only about I
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
think in the table was about 66,000
 
01:58:16.990 --> 01:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
filers for the interest in dividends tax
 
01:58:19.629 --> 01:58:19.639 align:start position:0%
um so several thousand could could
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
change things um however I I I think it
 
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
would be hard to hard to forecast that I
 
01:58:27.069 --> 01:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
think uh things like the stock market
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
more generally are going to add more
 
01:58:30.990 --> 01:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
variability probably than that but
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
that's just a hunch um uh so I I think
 
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's good that you're thinking about it
 
01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that it will move the
 
01:58:38.109 --> 01:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
needle that much or at least in a way
 
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's that
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
forecastable okay thank you yep you're
 
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
welcome looks like we're right on time
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
here and uh we have time for one more
 
01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:52.040 align:start position:0%
question but I do not see a hand so Phil
 
01:58:54.069 --> 01:58:54.079 align:start position:0%

Means Committee we were very happy to be
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
invited to participate and I thought the
 
02:00:25.709 --> 02:00:25.719 align:start position:0%
best way to provide sort of a
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
um photograph of what's going on with uh
 
02:00:32.189 --> 02:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's economy especially in
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing sector was to invite
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
three Bia members and they're from very
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
different types of companies so let me
 
02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
quickly introduce them and then we'll
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
move into their presentations and then
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
be happy to address any questions that
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee members will have uh first I'd
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
like to introduce Tom white he's
 
02:00:53.669 --> 02:00:53.679 align:start position:0%
president of New England wire
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
Technologies New England wire
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
Technologies is in Lisbon New Hampshire
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
it's a privately held Employee Stock
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
ownership company with more than 400
 
02:01:06.149 --> 02:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
employees and Facilities consisting of
 
02:01:10.109 --> 02:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
over 385,000 square feet of
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturing quality testing tooling
 
02:01:16.990 --> 02:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
machine fabrication and office space
 
02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
their on-site manufacturing process
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%

02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail as a part of his
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%

Hampshire in 1978 and currently has 21
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
employees so we've gone from the
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
spectrum of a large manufacturer down to
 
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
a rather small one the company provides
 
02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh contract casting and machining
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%

portfolio of 170 different unique parts
 
02:02:04.990 --> 02:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
and finally we have with us Cheryl
 
02:02:09.149 --> 02:02:09.159 align:start position:0%
Lawson Cheryl is the COO and CFO for the
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%

more than 40 people and specialize in
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
health and safety Consulting providing
 
02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
employee Wellness services and serving
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%

manufacturers program with almost 200

Manufacturing Company members so I
 
02:02:39.069 --> 02:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
thought she would be uh extremely useful
 
02:02:41.229 --> 02:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
in talking about the experiences of many
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
of her manufacturing trust members but
 
02:02:46.510 --> 02:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
let me first turn to Tom white president
 
02:02:49.069 --> 02:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
of New England wire Technologies and Tom
 
02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
let me turn it over to
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%

president of New England uh wi
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
Technologies Dave they have a very good
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
rundown of who we are and what we are um
 
02:03:09.149 --> 02:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
we're the main manufacturer in Lisbon
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
area and um we are a type of company
 
02:03:16.109 --> 02:03:16.119 align:start position:0%
that I would call is non-commodity we
 
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
make specific wire speci special need
 
02:03:22.270 --> 02:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
and the strength of our company or our
 
02:03:24.669 --> 02:03:24.679 align:start position:0%
employees period we've got a great work
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
ethic we have like I said about 40 400
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
employees and I will say that 2020 was a
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
challenge um we timing is everything in
 
02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
business and we decided to uh earlier to
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
engage a brand new Erp
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
system that was started on January 1st
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
of 2020 and uh and then of course in
 
02:03:54.270 --> 02:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
February we were challenged with the the
 
02:03:57.270 --> 02:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
covid situation so we were challenged
 
02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
with two major difficulties for the
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
company in
 
02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
2020 in
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
2019 uh we had a goal of sales of
 
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
approximately $80
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
million at the end of
 
02:04:14.910 --> 02:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
2019 we had sales of
 
02:04:20.109 --> 02:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
82 .9 million which is about three the
 
02:04:23.790 --> 02:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
3.4% increase in sales that are
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
projected because we had some certain
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
scenarios during a year we we projected
 
02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:30.990 align:start position:0%
scenarios during a year we we projected
for

02:04:30.990 --> 02:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
2020 of an
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
$82.5 Million worth of sales and in the
 
02:04:40.030 --> 02:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
first four months of 2020 it looked like
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
we were going to achieve up to
 
02:04:46.189 --> 02:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
potentially 7 to 8% increase over that
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
projection and then covid hit
 
02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
we ended up the year with 73
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
approximately $73 million worth of
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
sales and which was a
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
11.5% reduction in our
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
sales and again I I would say looking
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
back at it I think our achievement was
 
02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:11.320 align:start position:0%
the greatest achievement in the history
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
of the company or at least in the 40
 
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
years that I've been an employee at
 
02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:16.750 align:start position:0%
years that I've been an employee at
Newland

02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
Newland
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
wire our staff was in
 
02:05:22.669 --> 02:05:22.679 align:start position:0%
engaged um the effort was tremendous it
 
02:05:25.229 --> 02:05:25.239 align:start position:0%
was a next man up or next person up how
 
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
you want to look at it and I can't be
 
02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
proud of our employees and what they
 
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
were we um we had a situation where the
 
02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
number of orders were typically equal
 
02:05:41.069 --> 02:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
but instead of getting a $50,000 order
 
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
we might have got a $5,000
 
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
order we were fortunate enough to be
 
02:05:49.629 --> 02:05:49.639 align:start position:0%
identified as an essential company
 
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
and we certainly are essential because
 
02:05:55.069 --> 02:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
we meet uh many demands in the medical
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
the defense and certainly in the power
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
industry we were fortunate enough even
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
with the sales level we got if we hadn't
 
02:06:07.069 --> 02:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
got about a $2.5 Million worth of
 
02:06:11.310 --> 02:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
orders um in the medical area for
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
ventilators the ventilators was huge for
 
02:06:16.589 --> 02:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
us and we turned our facility around
 
02:06:19.870 --> 02:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
four ventilator cable um again very
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
proud of our people what we did what we
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
accomplished um the disconcerning thing
 
02:06:30.270 --> 02:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
to me um was uh it was great but every
 
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
inch of wire we sent to
 
02:06:35.709 --> 02:06:35.719 align:start position:0%
China which was disconcerting to me to
 
02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
be honest with you because I I really
 
02:06:40.229 --> 02:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
had hoped that it would have been all
 
02:06:43.069 --> 02:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
made in the US but um again we we did it
 
02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
we did a great job now um for 2021 we're
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
looking at $
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
79.1 million in sales this year which is
 
02:06:57.870 --> 02:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
about a 8% increase over our actual
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
sales last year um our our challenges we
 
02:07:05.589 --> 02:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
have we still have challenges even
 
02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
though the unemployment rate is what it
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
is uh and I'm not a believer in that
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
rate to be honest with you we still have
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
challenges finding people to
 
02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
work and um again we we our compensation
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
rates are equal or better than any
 
02:07:25.069 --> 02:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
employee in the area we have an Esau
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
program we have a profit sharing program
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh last year we shared uh about 56 hours
 
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
of bonus with our
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
employees and um I I look at us as as
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
being a very positive employee
 
02:07:43.790 --> 02:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
ER and um I'm positive about the
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
direction of the company I'm positive
 
02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
direction of the economy um
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not a politician um I I'm one who
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
believes that we're all in this together
 
02:07:59.390 --> 02:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
and I wish that both sides would look at
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the people not
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the best interest of a
 
02:08:07.069 --> 02:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
political party and I think you people
 
02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
will and uh I know we'll survive this
 
02:08:12.549 --> 02:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
thing and in the long run I communicate
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
to our employees very simply that we'll
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
be better when you get challenged you
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
come up with strategy that make you a
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
better company and I I tell you I can't
 
02:08:24.709 --> 02:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
be like I said before I'm ring again how
 
02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
much pride I have on our employees how
 
02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
they've overcome things we at one point
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
had approximately 50 people out of our
 
02:08:38.910 --> 02:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
facility based on the uh five or six
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
qualifications of being able to leave
 
02:08:42.549 --> 02:08:42.559 align:start position:0%
the company whether because they had
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
children who were out of school whatever
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
it may be and I I tell you people
 
02:08:49.870 --> 02:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
stepped up we our whole manufacturing
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
Force stayed in the facility we did we
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
followed all the CDC guidelines we got
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
bought equipment for um
 
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
sterilization we did the mask we did
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
send our sales group out of the office
 
02:09:06.990 --> 02:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
for the fact that we thought they they
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
could and they did work um fine on and
 
02:09:14.669 --> 02:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
remote I'm one that wanted our people to
 
02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
be work here because I think you can
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
develop a team when you talked to people
 
02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
face to face and we lost some teamwork
 
02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
with people being out whatever but we
 
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
did hold it together we are presently
 
02:09:29.589 --> 02:09:29.599 align:start position:0%
now everyone is back in the
 
02:09:34.030 --> 02:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
facility and I I'm very positive for the
 
02:09:36.750 --> 02:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
future and I may be the president of New
 
02:09:38.990 --> 02:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
England wire I'm probably best of being
 
02:09:40.510 --> 02:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
a cheerleader for New England wire
 
02:09:42.910 --> 02:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
because the positions today you need to
 
02:09:45.870 --> 02:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
be positive you need to be uh show
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
people there's a way to improve there's
 
02:09:49.189 --> 02:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
a way we are are going to get through
 
02:09:54.189 --> 02:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.310 --> 02:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
are thank you Tom uh Mr chair do you
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
want me to pause for questions or do you
 
02:10:01.629 --> 02:10:01.639 align:start position:0%
want me to go into the next panelist why
 
02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
don't we do the three panelists and then
 
02:10:07.069 --> 02:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to questions fine uh our
 
02:10:09.629 --> 02:10:09.639 align:start position:0%
next panelist is Val Jan zanu the
 
02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
president of graphic cast a manufacturer
 
02:10:15.549 --> 02:10:15.559 align:start position:0%
in Jaffrey in the manad region and Val
 
02:10:17.790 --> 02:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
is apparently broadcasting from the
 
02:10:21.030 --> 02:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
rather aial offices that come with being
 
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
the president of that company and he has
 
02:10:25.629 --> 02:10:25.639 align:start position:0%
a presentation he'll be sharing his
 
02:10:28.229 --> 02:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
screen so Val let me turn it over to you
 
02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I I wish that were my office uh
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah as as uh Dave mentioned uh we've
 
02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
been in the Jaffrey area since 1978 with
 
02:10:40.030 --> 02:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
21 employees uh we were up to about 25
 
02:10:42.629 --> 02:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
or 21 right now trying to balance things
 
02:10:45.229 --> 02:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
out uh as as Dave mentioned we are a
 
02:10:48.390 --> 02:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
contract manufacturer so we we make
 
02:10:51.149 --> 02:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
things for other people uh we have no
 
02:10:52.990 --> 02:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
products that are branded under under
 
02:10:56.189 --> 02:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
our name so we have to be uh pretty
 
02:10:58.549 --> 02:10:58.559 align:start position:0%
agile and pretty flexible in our ability
 
02:11:00.990 --> 02:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
to respond to the the needs of those
 
02:11:03.629 --> 02:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
customers and um as they mentioned we
 
02:11:05.709 --> 02:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
have a a portfolio of about 170
 
02:11:07.629 --> 02:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
different parts that we make for those
 
02:11:10.990 --> 02:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
customers but um we really have no
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
control over when they're going to order
 
02:11:15.390 --> 02:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
from us so we're we're operating
 
02:11:17.790 --> 02:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
basically uh at at the will of of not
 
02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
only the those companies but also sort
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
of at the at the uh Direction and
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
influence of the national economy and um
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
the other thing we contend with is that
 
02:11:31.229 --> 02:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a a difference in time
 
02:11:32.669 --> 02:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
between when we get an order for
 
02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
something and when we actually produce
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
it uh just because of how things line up
 
02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
in our queue so typically right now
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're running on a 16 to 18 week
 
02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
difference between when an order is
 
02:11:46.750 --> 02:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
placed to actually when we produce the
 
02:11:49.149 --> 02:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
part and ship it to the the the customer
 
02:11:50.510 --> 02:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
so as you'll see in the graphs that I'll
 
02:11:54.189 --> 02:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
show you uh those lags are you know are
 
02:11:56.189 --> 02:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
represented by by the types of
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
volatility and fluctuation that we have
 
02:12:00.990 --> 02:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh the other issue that we have uh I
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
call it the goldilock syndrome is
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
because we don't have control over the
 
02:12:07.390 --> 02:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
business coming in and we don't know
 
02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
when it's going to hit whatever we're
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
trying to be able to balance uh our
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
employment level and the inventory of
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
equipment we have on the floor so that
 
02:12:18.189 --> 02:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
on average you know we can meet that
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
that demand uh sometimes the demand
 
02:12:22.589 --> 02:12:22.599 align:start position:0%
drops off and we have too many people
 
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes the demand picks up and you
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
know we can't put enough hours in in a
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
week to to keep up with it um so that's
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
you know how we have to try to juggle
 
02:12:34.510 --> 02:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
things and I did mention um if you run a
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
business like this you definitely need a
 
02:12:39.229 --> 02:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
small or a very strong stomach uh some
 
02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
people lose sleep I don't but um it it
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
has its ups and downs so just to give
 
02:12:47.629 --> 02:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
you uh some some sense of the impact if
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
we look at the the bookings these are
 
02:12:50.549 --> 02:12:50.559 align:start position:0%
the orders that we actually get going
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
all the way back to 2007 uh you can see
 
02:12:56.189 --> 02:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
the impact of of the recession and some
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the other things that took place uh
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
nationally and globally on our
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
business 2007 was actually the best year
 
02:13:05.709 --> 02:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
we ever had with the company after the
 
02:13:07.229 --> 02:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
Great Recession and you can see the
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
impact that that had on our business in
 
02:13:11.669 --> 02:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
terms of uh bookings you know we dropped
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
about a third to 40% uh many of our
 
02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
customers uh did not come back they just
 
02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:18.709 align:start position:0%
customers uh did not come back they just
disappeared

02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
disappeared
 
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
so between then and 2012 or so we
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
rebuilt the business then there was a
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
small slowdown in 2012 that affected us
 
02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
then uh we went along fairly well until
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
about April of 2015 there was a a global
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing recession uh was very very
 
02:13:39.870 --> 02:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
abrupt and it it took us about four
 
02:13:42.910 --> 02:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
years as you can see here um to get out
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
of that recession and actually build
 
02:13:46.990 --> 02:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves back up to a a range that we
 
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
were operating uh profitably and fairly
 
02:13:53.950 --> 02:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh steadily and then Co hit um so we're
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
we're down quite a bit bookings uh 25%
 
02:14:01.549 --> 02:14:01.559 align:start position:0%
down 2000 calendar 2020 compared to
 
02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
2019 and if you know we look at that in
 
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
a little more detail the last two years
 
02:14:09.069 --> 02:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis you can see that
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
through 2019 into the early parts of
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
20120 there was a lot of volatility uh
 
02:14:16.030 --> 02:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of bookings we'd have some
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
months where we'd you know get almost
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars in orders and
 
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
then the next month we'd be down to
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
$100,000 so you know very very volatile
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
um for us the covid impact really
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
started around July uh during the first
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
few months of of of the the CID impact
 
02:14:38.669 --> 02:14:38.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know April May June time frame we
 
02:14:40.990 --> 02:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
were quite busy uh we have one customer
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
who customer who makes uh diagnostic
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
equipment for you know measuring covid
 
02:14:48.669 --> 02:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
and Sample
 
02:14:50.189 --> 02:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
uh their business was booming we
 
02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't make Parts fast enough for them
 
02:14:55.549 --> 02:14:55.559 align:start position:0%
but once July hit uh the momentum that
 
02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
we had built up through the first part
 
02:15:00.669 --> 02:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
of the year uh fell off dramatically and
 
02:15:05.069 --> 02:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
as I show here in uh August of 20120 we
 
02:15:07.310 --> 02:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
almost had no orders at all which is the
 
02:15:09.950 --> 02:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
only time that's happened in 42 years of
 
02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
company history so you go from August of
 
02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:14.069 align:start position:0%
company history so you go from August of
2019

02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
2019
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
$384,000 in new orders to August of 2020
 
02:15:21.310 --> 02:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
and it was almost zero uh that's the
 
02:15:23.629 --> 02:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
impact that that that Co has had on us
 
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's very very dramatic if we look at
 
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
our shipments and again over the same
 
02:15:29.390 --> 02:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
time period This is a monthly shipment
 
02:15:31.149 --> 02:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
schedule you can see the impact of the
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
recession as we dropped through 20078
 
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
and N we picked up to 2012 dropped off a
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
little in the summer there uh built the
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
business back up to 2015 went through a
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
long recession of very very flat sales
 
02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
for four years and then just as we were
 
02:15:49.470 --> 02:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
coming out of that re session covid hit
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
and we've dropped off again and if we
 
02:15:54.109 --> 02:15:54.119 align:start position:0%
look again at a at a monthly impact you
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
can see what happened there monthly
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
shipments were again volatile but a
 
02:16:00.350 --> 02:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
little bit more steady than the bookings
 
02:16:04.069 --> 02:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
but then um in in July you know the June
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
and July time frame are our our
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
shipments dropped by
 
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
50% uh and in the third quarter July
 
02:16:14.709 --> 02:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
August in September uh we're down 41%
 
02:16:16.549 --> 02:16:16.559 align:start position:0%
compared to the same quarter of last
 
02:16:19.390 --> 02:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
year uh year to year we're down 12 but
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
that particular quarter was bad but as
 
02:16:23.149 --> 02:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
you can see from you know July through
 
02:16:25.870 --> 02:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
the end of the year a slight Improvement
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
but not nearly enough to make make us
 
02:16:30.189 --> 02:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
profitable so we're we're running right
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
now we're running just about Break Even
 
02:16:35.429 --> 02:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
um so we're really seeing the impact of
 
02:16:38.709 --> 02:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
covid on us uh we really have a hard
 
02:16:41.950 --> 02:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
time projecting forward because uh we
 
02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
really don't know what's going to happen
 
02:16:45.469 --> 02:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
to our customers um you know some of
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
them have come back uh reasonably well
 
02:16:49.150 --> 02:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
others are still
 
02:16:52.750 --> 02:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
struggling um long range planning for us
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
is probably about a month um you know if
 
02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
I tried to project out a year I don't
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
think I would be able to get even close
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
to what may happen I know from our
 
02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
backlog that this quarter first quarter
 
02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:05.669 align:start position:0%
backlog that this quarter first quarter
of

02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:17:08.429 --> 02:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
2021 looks pretty good it's it's a
 
02:17:10.990 --> 02:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
continuation upward of that Trend but it
 
02:17:13.389 --> 02:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
it's nowhere near where we had to be and
 
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
we suspect by the end of our fiscal year
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
which is June 30th we'll probably be
 
02:17:20.669 --> 02:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
down 15 to 20% compared to the prior
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so it'll it'll be another
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
year uh probably of of a of a loss on
 
02:17:28.309 --> 02:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
the bottom line and um you know it'll
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
it'll still take us a little while to
 
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
climb back out of this so uh very
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
frustrating and that we've we were on
 
02:17:37.469 --> 02:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
the verge of really breaking out of a
 
02:17:39.669 --> 02:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
recession um now we've been hit with
 
02:17:41.669 --> 02:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
this and there's there's really
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
no no certainty and I think that's the
 
02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
biggest issue we have right now it's
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
very very difficult for us to predict
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
predict uh with any degree of certainty
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
exactly how things are going to go you
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
know in the next year I can tell you in
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
the next three months things look pretty
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
good but beyond that it's it's
 
02:18:00.669 --> 02:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
relatively flat um and we really don't
 
02:18:02.549 --> 02:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
have that much visibility so it's it's
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
going to be a tough year for us you know
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
we haven't um you know cut back on
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
salaries uh We've we've we've managed to
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
squeeze out some investment and some new
 
02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
equipment uh but it's it's a real
 
02:18:16.910 --> 02:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
juggling act trying to balance
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
everything out so we're as as previously
 
02:18:21.669 --> 02:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned we you know we optimistic
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
about our business and its
 
02:18:25.589 --> 02:18:25.599 align:start position:0%
capabilities um and we're trying to
 
02:18:27.790 --> 02:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
operate within the the boundaries of of
 
02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty that we have right now
 
02:18:32.910 --> 02:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
with the uh with the virus so we suspect
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know this year is going to be
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
relatively flat uh for us um we don't
 
02:18:40.669 --> 02:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
see a lot of growth growth opportunities
 
02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
if anything just a very slow uh recovery
 
02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
out of uh out of the depths of the uh
 
02:18:50.750 --> 02:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
Pand mic so that's that's about it thank
 
02:18:53.950 --> 02:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you Val and now let me turn to
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
Cheryl klei Lawson Cheryl is the Chief
 
02:18:59.230 --> 02:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
Operating Officer and Chief Financial
 
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
Officer for the Lawson group they are
 
02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
not a manufacturer but they have a lot
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
of manufacturing members in their
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
workers comp trust and they also uh
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
provide services to a number of other
 
02:19:11.950 --> 02:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
non-manufacturing companies I thought
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
she would be good to wrap up our panel
 
02:19:17.589 --> 02:19:17.599 align:start position:0%
just uh taking a look at from the 30,000
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
foot view what she's hearing from her
 
02:19:22.509 --> 02:19:22.519 align:start position:0%
client so Cheryl let me turn it over to

02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
invitation to to address the the the
 
02:19:30.910 --> 02:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
committee um as he said as David had
 
02:19:33.070 --> 02:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
said we are U the lawon group 80% of
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
what we do is we are a third-party
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
administrator for three of the state's
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
self-insured workers compensation trusts
 
02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
the largest trust being manufacturing
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
where we handle workers compensation for
 
02:19:48.750 --> 02:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh today 215 workers U manufacturing
 
02:19:51.550 --> 02:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
companies um some you know ranging from
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
all sizes large companies small
 
02:19:55.710 --> 02:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
companies we also handle workers
 
02:19:58.309 --> 02:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
compensation for about a 100 uh Lumber
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
related Industries to recognize loggers
 
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
cabinet makers all things wood uh and
 
02:20:05.469 --> 02:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
then there is another trust that we
 
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
manage which is Healthcare and Human
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
Services and that trust has about 72
 
02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
members all in total uh we manage about
 
02:20:18.030 --> 02:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
$20 million of premium in the state um
 
02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
the other side of our business which is
 
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
20% of what we do is U employer workers
 
02:20:24.510 --> 02:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
health and safety and we've been doing
 
02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
that for about 40 years um interestingly
 
02:20:31.309 --> 02:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
in our line of business in the non- comp
 
02:20:32.830 --> 02:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
so just to touch on our own business of
 
02:20:34.910 --> 02:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
health and safety uh this past year we
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
saw a 50% reduction in our Revenue 50%
 
02:20:41.550 --> 02:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
uh which was really staggering folks
 
02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
weren't opening their businesses it was
 
02:20:46.110 --> 02:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
all covid related um you know and we
 
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
There Was You someone explained to me in
 
02:20:50.510 --> 02:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
a presentation I watched earlier in the
 
02:20:53.389 --> 02:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
year um about this so-called recession
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
it is a is it a supply recession is it a
 
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
demand recession and you know if it's a
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
demand recession it's higher it's harder
 
02:21:00.990 --> 02:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
to come out of and they really believe
 
02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
that covid is a supply recession right
 
02:21:06.270 --> 02:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
it's we just don't have access to do
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
what we want to do or go where we want
 
02:21:11.790 --> 02:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
to go because of covid and as soon as
 
02:21:14.429 --> 02:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
all things covid are are improving
 
02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's vaccines testing what have
 
02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
you you know the the the demand goes
 
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
back up immediately right so we're
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
hoping it's an
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
improved um you know it's a it's a
 
02:21:27.309 --> 02:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
quicker return to to normal um on our
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
workers compensation side I will tell
 
02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
you that we won't see the impact of the
 
02:21:35.070 --> 02:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic in 2020 until we complete all
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
payroll audits because that's how um our
 
02:21:39.630 --> 02:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
our business model runs and we're
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
starting to um get into payroll audits
 
02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
in q1 and Q2 for all of last year I can
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
tell you that of all the members almost
 
02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
400 companies no one no one shut their
 
02:21:53.429 --> 02:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
doors no one called us up and said I'm
 
02:21:56.429 --> 02:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
having such a drastic reduction in
 
02:21:59.790 --> 02:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce that I need to revise my
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
workers compensation estimates right and
 
02:22:04.270 --> 02:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
we firmly believe that that was because
 
02:22:06.190 --> 02:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
of the stimulus PPP money that was in
 
02:22:08.030 --> 02:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
the Main Street money that was available
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
to all businesses right we we don't know
 
02:22:15.070 --> 02:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
what it will look like come 2021 year um
 
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
but we honestly believe that the PPP
 
02:22:19.309 --> 02:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
money kept people going um you know we
 
02:22:21.070 --> 02:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
talk to all of our businesses constantly
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
to understand how they're doing what
 
02:22:24.349 --> 02:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
they're seeing in the in in in the you
 
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
know in the current conditions and I
 
02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
will tell you that we our manufacturing
 
02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
group is our largest group and there's a
 
02:22:32.429 --> 02:22:32.439 align:start position:0%
variety of people there's residential
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
business Building Products oems
 
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
commercial building products um they
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
they run the gamut of of Manufacturers
 
02:22:43.550 --> 02:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
and the common theme that we hear is
 
02:22:45.389 --> 02:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
predictability everybody wants
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
predictability you know if I say to
 
02:22:49.710 --> 02:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
someone if I say to Val what's your
 
02:22:52.349 --> 02:22:52.359 align:start position:0%
perfect perfect business model he'd say
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
well uh if I had no employees if I had
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
no equipment and no customers life would
 
02:23:00.510 --> 02:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
be great right um that's you know that's
 
02:23:02.710 --> 02:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
that's manufacturing
 
02:23:04.830 --> 02:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
humor but we know that's that's not a
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
fact right so all those three things
 
02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
customers equipment and and and
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
employees create a level of
 
02:23:12.910 --> 02:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
predictability but it's a
 
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
predictability that we all as business
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
owners can manage if you throw the
 
02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic into the mix there's there's
 
02:23:22.750 --> 02:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
little virtually little to no
 
02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:24.439 align:start position:0%
predictability and there are three
 
02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
things really that folks are struggling
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
with one is the supply chain right we
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
have seen the vulnerability of our
 
02:23:33.389 --> 02:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
supply chain during this pandemic like
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
no other time you know it is quite
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
obvious that China is the world's
 
02:23:40.830 --> 02:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
Factory and given the fact that our
 
02:23:43.389 --> 02:23:43.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturers don't produce all of the
 
02:23:45.910 --> 02:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
parts necessary for their complete work
 
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
processes they work product um product
 
02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
production times have slowed down the
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
delivery of product to customers if
 
02:23:56.349 --> 02:23:56.359 align:start position:0%
their customers are still ordering has
 
02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
slowed down and we have no way to
 
02:24:03.389 --> 02:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
control that supply chain and we don't
 
02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
know what that looks like in 2021 either
 
02:24:08.469 --> 02:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's an issue out of our
 
02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
control the second issue and Tom touched
 
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
on it as well um is employment you know
 
02:24:15.870 --> 02:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
employment has always been a struggle
 
02:24:17.710 --> 02:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire you know it's a
 
02:24:19.309 --> 02:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
it's a blessing and a curse that we have
 
02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
the low unemployment rates that we have
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
and if you normalize for travel and
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
tourism and hotel and restaurant you
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
know our unemployment rates are almost
 
02:24:30.269 --> 02:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
back to pre-pandemic
 
02:24:33.429 --> 02:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
rates our employer our employers
 
02:24:36.030 --> 02:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
struggled with the stimulus package with
 
02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
the additional enhanced unemployment
 
02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
benefit people were able to stay home
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
and make more money than going to work
 
02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
they're concerned with what we're
 
02:24:46.469 --> 02:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
hearing that's coming out of Washington
 
02:24:48.750 --> 02:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
that we'll be in the same place this
 
02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:49.670 align:start position:0%
that we'll be in the same place this
coming

02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
coming
 
02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
year right so so we have a concern about
 
02:24:55.870 --> 02:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
the workforce and the ability to higher
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
some of our employers are struggling
 
02:24:59.870 --> 02:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
with the availability of testing for
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
covid right can we make testing more
 
02:25:05.309 --> 02:25:05.319 align:start position:0%
available maybe on site for employers so
 
02:25:07.150 --> 02:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
they don't have that wait time so
 
02:25:08.429 --> 02:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
02:25:11.469 --> 02:25:11.479 align:start position:0%
pulling um co-workers to fill in at an
 
02:25:13.269 --> 02:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
overtime level while folks are waiting
 
02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
at home for test results that may be
 
02:25:17.469 --> 02:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
negative right so is there a shift there
 
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
that can that can you know that we can
 
02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:20.630 align:start position:0%
that can that can you know that we can
expedite

02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
expedite
 
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
testing um the other the other Common
 
02:25:26.309 --> 02:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
Thread that that I see um is is is
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
revenue right it's the inability to
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
predict your Revenue right we have
 
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
customers whose we have me trust members
 
02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
rather whose customers are
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities who aren't spending we
 
02:25:41.389 --> 02:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
have members whose customer based are um
 
02:25:44.190 --> 02:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
higher education who are not spending uh
 
02:25:46.830 --> 02:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
there's a contraction in the in the
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
Salesforce there are some businesses
 
02:25:51.710 --> 02:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
albeit as we heard Phil um say just
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
before this that are doing very well
 
02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
sure it's the larger businesses much
 
02:25:58.190 --> 02:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
larger businesses who have access to
 
02:26:01.070 --> 02:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
more resources but most of our
 
02:26:02.510 --> 02:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
businesses and most of the business here
 
02:26:04.230 --> 02:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are your smaller
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
businesses right who who don't have
 
02:26:09.790 --> 02:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
those resources and they're getting very
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
creative right folks who are putting
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
more money towards Capital Improvements
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
in their shop how can I improve my l
 
02:26:19.150 --> 02:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
because I know I'm not going to be able
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
to hire the necessary folks how can I
 
02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
improve um you know um my my production
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
how can I improve with with some with
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
some Capital that I'm able to you know
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
to to secure and they've they were able
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
to last year some companies Inc improve
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
their balance sheet with capital because
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
of PPP
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
funding it's not going to be there this
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
year so so I can say in in summary it's
 
02:26:47.870 --> 02:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
what we're hearing is uncertainty and
 
02:26:49.950 --> 02:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
predictability right and now you throw
 
02:26:51.710 --> 02:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
in one more piece of what would be
 
02:26:53.269 --> 02:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
coming out of Washington for increased
 
02:26:56.349 --> 02:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
tax rates uh for businesses uh a push on
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
an increase in a minimum wage those are
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
all disconcerting uh and they have
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
business owners just
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
pausing um so that that's what that's
 
02:27:07.630 --> 02:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing from our businesses
 
02:27:09.750 --> 02:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
and and B and and and Tom couldn't said
 
02:27:11.309 --> 02:27:11.319 align:start position:0%
it any better so I appreciate the
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come forward and just
 
02:27:14.830 --> 02:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
share with you what what I'm what I'm
 
02:27:16.190 --> 02:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
hearing and the conversations we're
 
02:27:17.950 --> 02:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
having so thank you very much thanks
 
02:27:21.870 --> 02:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
David thank you Cheryl and uh Tom and
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
Val and let me turn it over to you Mr
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
chair we are happy to try and answer any
 
02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:36.190 --> 02:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
have thank you and I thank Val Cheryl
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
and Tom for their
 
02:27:40.110 --> 02:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
presentation it really helps the
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
committee to understand the the depth of
 
02:27:46.190 --> 02:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
the issues that have caused by the
 
02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:47.870 align:start position:0%
the issues that have caused by the
pandemic

02:27:47.870 --> 02:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:27:51.710 --> 02:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
and how they're become so exasperated
 
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
with the uncertainty that exists today
 
02:27:57.630 --> 02:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
so we'll start off with the first leg
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
justat to ask a question is
 
02:27:59.359 --> 02:28:00.630 align:start position:0%
justat to ask a question is
representative

02:28:00.630 --> 02:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
Tucker yes uh my question is directed to
 
02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:05.070 align:start position:0%
Tucker yes uh my question is directed to
Mr

02:28:05.070 --> 02:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:28:08.030 --> 02:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
White uh I visited your plant two or
 
02:28:11.870 --> 02:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
three times and uh it's very very
 
02:28:14.910 --> 02:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
impressive and it's an enormous asset to
 
02:28:18.030 --> 02:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
the North country I'm wondering whether
 
02:28:20.349 --> 02:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
you're finding that young
 
02:28:22.990 --> 02:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
people uh really understand
 
02:28:27.389 --> 02:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and find the idea of
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
working uh at a factory appealing or
 
02:28:34.030 --> 02:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
whether there's a problem with
 
02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
attracting younger workers and what we
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
can do to help you with that if
 
02:28:42.670 --> 02:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
anything I think that's a a great
 
02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
question um from my back history I'm a
 
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
former teacher
 
02:28:50.590 --> 02:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
and uh we we in this company have
 
02:28:53.590 --> 02:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
reached out to the local communities to
 
02:28:56.269 --> 02:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
try to educate schools and their
 
02:28:59.469 --> 02:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
students so what potential positions are
 
02:29:02.269 --> 02:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
available in facility like new and wire
 
02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
whether would be accounting or
 
02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
engineering or production or whatever it
 
02:29:10.990 --> 02:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
may be and and I for one I feel that the
 
02:29:13.870 --> 02:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
the greatest asset that we have is our
 
02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:15.110 align:start position:0%
the greatest asset that we have is our
young

02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
young
 
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
people uh I remember when I was young uh
 
02:29:20.990 --> 02:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
older people would say I would never
 
02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
make it your generation's not uh work
 
02:29:28.269 --> 02:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
ethic isn't good enough and all that and
 
02:29:30.990 --> 02:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
and I I prove I guess most of us proved
 
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
them wrong and and now you hear the same
 
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
thing from people in our generation
 
02:29:38.830 --> 02:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
saying the same thing about younger
 
02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
generation I don't see that I see the
 
02:29:43.710 --> 02:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
young people coming out of schools in
 
02:29:47.190 --> 02:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
this area uh are very capable
 
02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
and as long as they they're educated
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
potential is there and we have hired a
 
02:29:54.910 --> 02:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
lot of young people have worked out
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
great the work ethic is good the
 
02:29:59.950 --> 02:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
capabilities with computers are far
 
02:30:02.469 --> 02:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
superior to mine and we have a
 
02:30:04.190 --> 02:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of computerization in
 
02:30:07.309 --> 02:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
our company and and I for one feel very
 
02:30:09.269 --> 02:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
confident that young people today
 
02:30:10.990 --> 02:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
particularly will go into manufactur and
 
02:30:12.469 --> 02:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
do a great
 
02:30:16.750 --> 02:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
job so um again the challenge is for
 
02:30:20.269 --> 02:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
comp like Lisbon in Newland wire is is
 
02:30:22.870 --> 02:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
our model is very simple we want to keep
 
02:30:26.349 --> 02:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
our best here for a long period of time
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
some of our best students in the local
 
02:30:30.030 --> 02:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
area whether it be Woodsville Lisbon
 
02:30:32.550 --> 02:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
Littleton profile whatever we're we're
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
going to school at un or a BC or WPI or
 
02:30:40.269 --> 02:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
RIT and never coming
 
02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
back we have made a priority that we
 
02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
hire somewhere between 20 and 25
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
college students per summer to try them
 
02:30:54.030 --> 02:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
on one I call them try them on we want
 
02:30:55.950 --> 02:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
to see what work ethic what capability
 
02:30:57.510 --> 02:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
they might be to become a long-term
 
02:30:59.910 --> 02:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
employee at no England wi and it's
 
02:31:02.309 --> 02:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
worked out great we hired we fired we
 
02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
HED four or five people college students
 
02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
last year for that so again I probably a
 
02:31:12.190 --> 02:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
long answer but U I'm all for young
 
02:31:15.469 --> 02:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
people and and we can attract people
 
02:31:17.429 --> 02:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
from the production level all the way up
 
02:31:19.710 --> 02:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
to an engineering level as long as you
 
02:31:21.870 --> 02:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
communicate you educate and you provide
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
them a path to successfully make
 
02:31:24.319 --> 02:31:27.230 align:start position:0%
them a path to successfully make
themselves

02:31:27.230 --> 02:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
successful oh thank you very much okay
 
02:31:30.479 --> 02:31:33.429 align:start position:0%
successful oh thank you very much okay
Senator

02:31:33.429 --> 02:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
guer thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:31:37.710 --> 02:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
gentlemen all for your fine
 
02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
presentations uh my questions are two
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
first uh uh specifically to our
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturing uh person Val um and to
 
02:31:48.309 --> 02:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
all of you do you
 
02:31:48.319 --> 02:31:49.870 align:start position:0%
all of you do you
anticipate

02:31:49.870 --> 02:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
02:31:53.950 --> 02:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh Federal possible federal tax uh
 
02:31:55.950 --> 02:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
policy changes
 
02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
impacting uh your taxes in New Hampshire
 
02:32:01.870 --> 02:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
your contributions to our tax base
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:07.830 --> 02:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
question uh I don't see anything Federal
 
02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
level having much of an impact on on uh
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
on us my size company um you know I take
 
02:32:17.830 --> 02:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
advantage of the various tax credits and
 
02:32:20.790 --> 02:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
whatever that are there I don't see uh
 
02:32:22.469 --> 02:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
anything on the horizon that would have
 
02:32:25.309 --> 02:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
a major impact on us so everything that
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
we we do in terms of investment um and
 
02:32:31.110 --> 02:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
trying to move our company forward is
 
02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
based on our markets not so much on uh
 
02:32:36.469 --> 02:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
federal tax or or other other types of
 
02:32:39.630 --> 02:32:39.640 align:start position:0%
policies uh things like the you know
 
02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:40.590 align:start position:0%
policies uh things like the you know
minimum

02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
wage that could be a problem as as
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
Cheryl was saying I mean we we pay a
 
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
starting person with almost no
 
02:32:50.910 --> 02:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
experience $16 an hour people coming in
 
02:32:53.830 --> 02:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
with experience maybe 17 or 18 that's a
 
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
$10 difference right now between minimum
 
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
wage and what we pay that's a that's a
 
02:33:01.950 --> 02:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
lot of incentive to work here if someone
 
02:33:04.190 --> 02:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
can make 15 bucks an hour of flipping
 
02:33:07.070 --> 02:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
burgers or you know working in a in an
 
02:33:09.269 --> 02:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
environment where they really have to
 
02:33:11.190 --> 02:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
you know put effort in and think about
 
02:33:13.790 --> 02:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
what they're doing for a $2 or $3 an
 
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
hour difference hey I'm I'm going to
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
lose employees real fast I mean there's
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
just no there's no incentive for anyone
 
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
to want to try to learn a trade when the
 
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
differential between a base pay for a
 
02:33:31.950 --> 02:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
low value job like a flipping a burger
 
02:33:33.790 --> 02:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
is going to pay almost what I can pay
 
02:33:36.670 --> 02:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
and I I'm not in a market where I have
 
02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of value in my product that I
 
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
can raise my differential back to five
 
02:33:45.630 --> 02:33:45.640 align:start position:0%
or $10 doll an hour I mean I'm I'm
 
02:33:47.830 --> 02:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
basically breaking even right
 
02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
now unless the whole country went up and
 
02:33:53.469 --> 02:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
I could raise my prices and not not uh
 
02:33:56.429 --> 02:33:56.439 align:start position:0%
be affected by it um you know
 
02:34:00.389 --> 02:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
differential raises in in minimum wage
 
02:34:02.990 --> 02:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know could kill companies like mine
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
we we just don't have we're not making
 
02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
turban blades that sell for thousands of
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
dollars where I can afford an extra
 
02:34:10.830 --> 02:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
couple dollars an hour in labor we we
 
02:34:12.269 --> 02:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
just don't have that we're we're right
 
02:34:14.309 --> 02:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
at the razor's Edge right now if I could
 
02:34:17.630 --> 02:34:17.640 align:start position:0%
pay people more I would do so but I I
 
02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
have to balance out between what I can
 
02:34:22.510 --> 02:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
pay and what the company can afford uh
 
02:34:24.990 --> 02:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
to to keep itself alive so those are the
 
02:34:28.110 --> 02:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
sorts of things that we we we worry
 
02:34:33.190 --> 02:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
about thank you uh second does Cheryl or
 
02:34:36.309 --> 02:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
Tom want to respond to
 
02:34:39.030 --> 02:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
that from New England standpoint our
 
02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
stting wages are anywhere between $18
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
and 20 $20 per hour so the what the
 
02:34:46.590 --> 02:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
federates do
 
02:34:49.830 --> 02:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
has basically no impact U from a state
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
level um we're very much involved with
 
02:34:54.910 --> 02:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
the R&amp;D tax our company is based on
 
02:34:58.349 --> 02:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
Specialty Products that um requires a
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
lot of investment into R&amp;D and and doing
 
02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
things that so that may have an impact
 
02:35:07.710 --> 02:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
but uh in general um I I don't feel that
 
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
whatever the federal government does is
 
02:35:11.469 --> 02:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
going to have a significant impact on on
 
02:35:14.190 --> 02:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:21.870 --> 02:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
cherl you're M
 
02:35:24.990 --> 02:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
muted you'll have to unmute yourself
 
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
Cheryl sorry about that um I I think Val
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
said it said it um perfectly about the
 
02:35:32.269 --> 02:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
concern with the minimum wage I mean
 
02:35:35.070 --> 02:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
only one only 1% of the of the of the
 
02:35:36.750 --> 02:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
workforce is at minimum wage here in New
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anyways um you know I have
 
02:35:41.510 --> 02:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
heard from some members that you know
 
02:35:43.269 --> 02:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
the incre the potential increase in
 
02:35:44.990 --> 02:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
taxes that are coming out of Washington
 
02:35:47.630 --> 02:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
may have some employes ERS um look at
 
02:35:49.110 --> 02:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know holding off on Capital
 
02:35:51.429 --> 02:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh from a from a cash
 
02:35:53.469 --> 02:35:53.479 align:start position:0%
perspective um but I don't think it will
 
02:35:56.590 --> 02:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
have any impact on any tax base here in
 
02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um you know I don't think
 
02:36:01.550 --> 02:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
it will have any impact on um you know
 
02:36:03.070 --> 02:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
Staffing here in New Hampshire because
 
02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
the problem is we can't hire hire
 
02:36:10.429 --> 02:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
enough um Senator last coming and we've
 
02:36:12.150 --> 02:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
actually done the opposite this is one
 
02:36:14.429 --> 02:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
last comment we've actually increased
 
02:36:17.309 --> 02:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
our uh expenditure in capital
 
02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
investment we we felt strongly that um
 
02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
in times of downturn was time to
 
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
invest so we've done the same we've
 
02:36:30.790 --> 02:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
invested about uh four and a half to
 
02:36:33.710 --> 02:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
five million dollar worth of equipment
 
02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
um this past year in
 
02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
2020 to do exactly what you're talking
 
02:36:40.990 --> 02:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
about Val to try to improved capacity
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
improved efficiencies and whatever which
 
02:36:46.349 --> 02:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
uh again um we at one point point we're
 
02:36:50.269 --> 02:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
about 430 employees about 400 we we
 
02:36:52.230 --> 02:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
haven't laid anybody off it's mostly
 
02:36:54.590 --> 02:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
through attrition and retirement but
 
02:36:57.309 --> 02:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
we've actually will be able to I think
 
02:37:00.190 --> 02:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
produce $80 million worth of sales in
 
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
investment Senator gerer your second
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
party thank you Mr chairman I know this
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
is of interest to you as well uh do any
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
of your businesses utilize any New
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business tax credits I heard
 
02:37:19.389 --> 02:37:19.399 align:start position:0%
R&amp;D mentioned if so uh will you increase
 
02:37:21.870 --> 02:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
your use this year because of the covid
 
02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh or will it remain the same
 
02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:26.510 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh or will it remain the same
or

02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
decrease so we've we've been using the
 
02:37:31.870 --> 02:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
R&amp;D tax credit since its
 
02:37:35.150 --> 02:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
Inception um we pretty much have R&amp;D
 
02:37:36.990 --> 02:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
going on all the time again as a
 
02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
contract manufacturer every new piece of
 
02:37:42.150 --> 02:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
business that I get is is an R&amp;D project
 
02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
we have to develop a process do
 
02:37:47.150 --> 02:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
everything else um I don't don't see us
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
increasing it uh because it's really
 
02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
driven by um you know the level of
 
02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
business we have if we don't have a lot
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
of new business uh there's not as much
 
02:38:00.510 --> 02:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
but what we're doing along with that
 
02:38:04.990 --> 02:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
effort to uh in increase our equipment's
 
02:38:07.389 --> 02:38:07.399 align:start position:0%
capability with capital Investments is
 
02:38:09.910 --> 02:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're spending a lot more time refining
 
02:38:11.469 --> 02:38:11.479 align:start position:0%
the processes that we have right now
 
02:38:13.269 --> 02:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
trying to get time out of them to get
 
02:38:15.469 --> 02:38:15.479 align:start position:0%
our our efficiencies up because we don't
 
02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
see a lot of Topline uh growth you know
 
02:38:19.349 --> 02:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
we're not going to see our sales
 
02:38:20.910 --> 02:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
increase a lot so the only way we're
 
02:38:22.830 --> 02:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
going to survive is to get the cost out
 
02:38:25.349 --> 02:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
of our business so that means um you
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
know new equipment you know I I just
 
02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
replaced a 30y old piece of equipment
 
02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
with a brand new uh machine and we're
 
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to add new machines as as
 
02:38:36.030 --> 02:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
as we can afford to do that but at the
 
02:38:38.510 --> 02:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
same time we're spending time on those
 
02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
improvements all that becomes part of
 
02:38:43.429 --> 02:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
R&amp;D so the R&amp;D tax credit for us is is a
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
critical uh part of our business so so
 
02:38:48.309 --> 02:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
we're really you know concerned when we
 
02:38:51.070 --> 02:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
hear you know talk about reducing or
 
02:38:52.950 --> 02:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
eliminating the R&amp;D tax credit because
 
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's so critical to a business like
 
02:39:00.670 --> 02:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:04.030 --> 02:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
grow we continue we will continue to use
 
02:39:06.990 --> 02:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
at the same level or potentially
 
02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
increase relative to what Cheryl was
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
saying about the company that she does
 
02:39:15.710 --> 02:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
we have consciously uh vertically
 
02:39:17.910 --> 02:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
integrated our company to be less
 
02:39:20.190 --> 02:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
reliant on other
 
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
people uh it was kind of the we we took
 
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
the the opposite route of what most
 
02:39:27.269 --> 02:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
people were telling us to do in the late
 
02:39:30.550 --> 02:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
1990s and early 2000s and said we're
 
02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
going to be our supplier for ourselves
 
02:39:35.429 --> 02:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
as much as we possibly can and and
 
02:39:36.910 --> 02:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
that's where the growth has come from
 
02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
our number of people as well as our
 
02:39:41.349 --> 02:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
Technologies because as we continue to
 
02:39:44.750 --> 02:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
grow as a company that R&amp;D tax is
 
02:39:46.469 --> 02:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely imp comperative because we're
 
02:39:48.790 --> 02:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
investing a significant amount of money
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
to improve our capabilities in the
 
02:39:53.389 --> 02:39:53.399 align:start position:0%
materials we're making and honestly we
 
02:39:56.910 --> 02:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
have had zero problems getting product
 
02:39:58.950 --> 02:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
from our suppliers we've been very
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
fortunate we've had zero problems and uh
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
We've also tried to make sure that we
 
02:40:06.590 --> 02:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
have at least two suppliers for every
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
product we get which we're not always
 
02:40:10.950 --> 02:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
successful there but we've tried so
 
02:40:12.590 --> 02:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's where New England's
 
02:40:16.190 --> 02:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
experience Cheryl great yeah we we as
 
02:40:18.230 --> 02:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
the Lawson group personally don't don't
 
02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
utilize any tax credit you know
 
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
advantages here within the company and
 
02:40:24.389 --> 02:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
Val and Tom can speak to it better than
 
02:40:26.469 --> 02:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
I can uh you know on behalf of our
 
02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
membership good thank you okay the next
 
02:40:34.750 --> 02:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
Bron thank you Norm um thank you
 
02:40:41.830 --> 02:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
everyone for your presentations so I
 
02:40:43.469 --> 02:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
think the two companies that we heard
 
02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
from uh that are manufacturers
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh Tom and U and Val
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
companies typify New Hampshire kind of
 
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturing where it's really where no
 
02:40:58.510 --> 02:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
no uh uh consumer product type companies
 
02:41:01.469 --> 02:41:01.479 align:start position:0%
no brand names come out of our state uh
 
02:41:03.790 --> 02:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
with a few exceptions no Apple computer
 
02:41:07.710 --> 02:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
no Ford motor Etc so first I want maybe
 
02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
Dave can touch on this for for the
 
02:41:12.750 --> 02:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee that these These are really
 
02:41:14.630 --> 02:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
these two companies really tyfy the kind
 
02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
of even the larger ones uh larger
 
02:41:18.590 --> 02:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturers seem to fit in this
 
02:41:20.870 --> 02:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
category but my question for after that
 
02:41:24.790 --> 02:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
for Tom and for Val is how how much of
 
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
your sales is are in State versus out of
 
02:41:30.230 --> 02:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
state so Dave you want to take it first
 
02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
and then yeah I'll just respond to the
 
02:41:34.950 --> 02:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
part of your question about what type of
 
02:41:39.230 --> 02:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturing takes place here and um
 
02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
there are some manufacturers that
 
02:41:43.469 --> 02:41:43.479 align:start position:0%
manufacture products that consumer
 
02:41:46.150 --> 02:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
products that that are made here but for
 
02:41:48.349 --> 02:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
the most part the vast majority of
 
02:41:50.230 --> 02:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
Manufacturers or what we would call
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
component manufacturers they make things
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
that are sent to other manufacturers
 
02:41:58.830 --> 02:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
around the country or around the world
 
02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
to uh use in their products um and you
 
02:42:06.469 --> 02:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
know while while I'm guess on that point
 
02:42:09.910 --> 02:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's what makes the R&amp;D tax credit so
 
02:42:12.830 --> 02:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
critical for the manufacturers in in
 
02:42:16.469 --> 02:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
this state is there having to develop
 
02:42:18.349 --> 02:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
oftentimes these new components and
 
02:42:20.750 --> 02:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
these new parts it's what Val does
 
02:42:24.110 --> 02:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
almost every day of of of his work at
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
graphic cast um so it's just it's you
 
02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
know I'm appreciate uh Senator G asking
 
02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
about that because it does illustrate a
 
02:42:37.870 --> 02:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
really important and well-used uh
 
02:42:40.590 --> 02:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
Economic Development incentive here in
 
02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:42.510 align:start position:0%

02:42:44.510 --> 02:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire talking about our customer
 
02:42:47.349 --> 02:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
base I have about 70 companies that we
 
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
make product for only one of them is in
 
02:42:51.429 --> 02:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire everyone else is some
 
02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
other state thanks
 
02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:55.550 align:start position:0%
other state thanks
pal

02:42:55.550 --> 02:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
pal
 
02:42:59.910 --> 02:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
Tom about 5% of our sales is is in
 
02:43:04.590 --> 02:43:04.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you say five about 5% um but
 
02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
the the main supplier for one of our raw
 
02:43:10.670 --> 02:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
materials is also an Hampshire company
 
02:43:13.870 --> 02:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:15.950 --> 02:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
02:43:20.349 --> 02:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
um next is from Jordan represent
 
02:43:22.990 --> 02:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
urle uh thank you for taking my uh
 
02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
question the comment that was made I
 
02:43:28.630 --> 02:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
believe it was um by um Mr zanchuck
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
regarding the minimum wage I thought
 
02:43:33.910 --> 02:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
thought was telling where if you have a
 
02:43:37.469 --> 02:43:37.479 align:start position:0%
a set base for a McDonald's worker of
 
02:43:40.590 --> 02:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
$15 an hour that means that for you to
 
02:43:42.030 --> 02:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
compete you're going to have and you're
 
02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
doubling the minimum wage now so you
 
02:43:47.349 --> 02:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
essentially would have to double
 
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
your base rate your entry rate wage and
 
02:43:52.870 --> 02:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
that would mean then that you would have
 
02:43:57.190 --> 02:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
to raise your prices as well and that I
 
02:43:59.429 --> 02:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
think would apply across the board
 
02:44:02.590 --> 02:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
to the entire uh
 
02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:04.710 align:start position:0%
to the entire uh
manufacturing

02:44:04.710 --> 02:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
spectrum that would be that your your
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
comment Mr zanj I thought was very
 
02:44:13.269 --> 02:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
cogent the other part about that is
 
02:44:17.550 --> 02:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
though but if you're raising your cost
 
02:44:20.030 --> 02:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm buying it that means that I have
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
to raise my cost for the product that
 
02:44:24.990 --> 02:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
I'm manufacturing which means the costs
 
02:44:27.110 --> 02:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
go up so the effect of a minimum wage
 
02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:28.910 align:start position:0%
go up so the effect of a minimum wage
raise

02:44:28.910 --> 02:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
raise
 
02:44:31.469 --> 02:44:31.479 align:start position:0%
is doesn't
 
02:44:34.710 --> 02:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
exist is that analysis basically correct
 
02:44:37.389 --> 02:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
from your point of view yeah it is it is
 
02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
from mine because you know if if
 
02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
everything went up you know 10% um you
 
02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
know then relatively everything is still
 
02:44:48.950 --> 02:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the same proportion I mean in the end
 
02:44:50.190 --> 02:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
you know a
 
02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:51.830 align:start position:0%
you know a
job

02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
job
 
02:44:55.030 --> 02:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
pays what it's worth and the and the
 
02:44:57.469 --> 02:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
value that it produces for the for the
 
02:44:59.389 --> 02:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
company that's employing that
 
02:45:02.429 --> 02:45:02.439 align:start position:0%
person you know if if the value isn't
 
02:45:05.309 --> 02:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
there you you can't pay them more money
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
it just it's just it it's not
 
02:45:10.630 --> 02:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
supportable uh economically that's why I
 
02:45:12.070 --> 02:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned about you know the Val the
 
02:45:13.790 --> 02:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
intrinsic value of the product that we
 
02:45:15.950 --> 02:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
sell I mean we we have some parts that
 
02:45:18.269 --> 02:45:18.279 align:start position:0%
we sell here for three or4 dollars a
 
02:45:21.269 --> 02:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
piece the most expensive part we sell is
 
02:45:21.279 --> 02:45:22.630 align:start position:0%
piece the most expensive part we sell is
about

02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:45:25.750 --> 02:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
120 you know we we make a a certain
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
margin um you know between what we pay
 
02:45:30.190 --> 02:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
our employees and the benefits and
 
02:45:31.349 --> 02:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
everything else that goes along with
 
02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
that if at the end of the year you know
 
02:45:36.990 --> 02:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
we have 2% or 3% on the bottom line
 
02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's a lot um you know for a
 
02:45:41.790 --> 02:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
small company so you know we become an
 
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
engine to keep 21 people and their
 
02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:45.750 align:start position:0%
engine to keep 21 people and their
family

02:45:45.750 --> 02:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
family
 
02:45:49.190 --> 02:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know fed and housed and and you know
 
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
we have a little left over and as an
 
02:45:53.550 --> 02:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
ESOP company as well you know that helps
 
02:45:57.070 --> 02:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
our employees but there's really not not
 
02:45:59.389 --> 02:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
much there uh at the end of the day
 
02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
between what we have to do um if we were
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
in a market where we had the ability to
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
pay more right now I'd be paying it
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
because I um you know I'm me in the
 
02:46:11.910 --> 02:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
competitive employment Market here in in
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
the madog region I have New Hampshire
 
02:46:16.510 --> 02:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
ball bearings on one side of me with 800
 
02:46:18.870 --> 02:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
employees I have milipore on the other
 
02:46:21.670 --> 02:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
side trying to hire 300 people I mean
 
02:46:23.710 --> 02:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
they're all within three miles of where
 
02:46:26.110 --> 02:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
I am so I have to pay competitive wages
 
02:46:28.269 --> 02:46:28.279 align:start position:0%
and have competitive benefits just to
 
02:46:31.150 --> 02:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
try to get people in the door um so you
 
02:46:33.469 --> 02:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
know it's a it's a real struggle trying
 
02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
to you know offer enough money to get
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
people in and also being able to to to
 
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
pay them and it's it's driven by our
 
02:46:45.190 --> 02:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
sort of Market wages for what we do do
 
02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
here plus the general economy um any any
 
02:46:50.990 --> 02:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
disruption to that that is that is
 
02:46:54.670 --> 02:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
totally arbitrary and not reflective of
 
02:46:57.910 --> 02:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
economic value generated by people is is
 
02:46:59.510 --> 02:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
just going to disrupt the whole the
 
02:47:02.070 --> 02:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
whole uh the balance there so there
 
02:47:04.469 --> 02:47:04.479 align:start position:0%
there has to be a reason uh and an
 
02:47:07.750 --> 02:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
economic value to to increasing wages I
 
02:47:10.269 --> 02:47:10.279 align:start position:0%
I just can't go out and in raise my
 
02:47:14.070 --> 02:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
prices 25 or 30% without having you know
 
02:47:15.950 --> 02:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
somebody in another part of the country
 
02:47:17.870 --> 02:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
outbid me and I end up losing the
 
02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
business and then what happens is 21
 
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
people are out of a job so I mean it
 
02:47:26.190 --> 02:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
sense it's my opinion that um by raising
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
the the federal middle wage is going to
 
02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:34.030 align:start position:0%
the the federal middle wage is going to
negatively

02:47:34.030 --> 02:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
negatively
 
02:47:37.510 --> 02:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
impact the market that is most affected
 
02:47:40.710 --> 02:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
by Co you're talking about restaurants
 
02:47:42.550 --> 02:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
you're talking about hotels and hos
 
02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
ability hospitality and stuff like that
 
02:47:46.870 --> 02:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's the labor market that's been
 
02:47:49.110 --> 02:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
affected by most by CO as far as I can
 
02:47:51.950 --> 02:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
see and when you raise the minimum wage
 
02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
to $15 an
 
02:47:56.110 --> 02:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
hour you're going to put more and more
 
02:47:58.950 --> 02:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
companies or hotels or restaurants out
 
02:48:02.110 --> 02:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
of business because of it I'm a big
 
02:48:05.230 --> 02:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
believer in open market you pay for what
 
02:48:07.030 --> 02:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
you can pay for and if you're not you're
 
02:48:08.750 --> 02:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
paying lower than somebody else then you
 
02:48:09.990 --> 02:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
may not get an
 
02:48:12.870 --> 02:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
employee right let let the open market
 
02:48:15.269 --> 02:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
determine what the wages are and that's
 
02:48:17.630 --> 02:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
just my opinion
 
02:48:21.710 --> 02:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
Cheryl I I I concur they they they
 
02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
they've said it they've said it the best
 
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
anything I would say would be would be
 
02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:26.070 align:start position:0%
anything I would say would be would be
completely

02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
completely
 
02:48:28.870 --> 02:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
redundant okay next question from
 
02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:30.750 align:start position:0%
redundant okay next question from
representative

02:48:30.750 --> 02:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:48:33.870 --> 02:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you I'm not going to get into
 
02:48:36.830 --> 02:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage but
 
02:48:41.790 --> 02:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
on the situation was the same back in 20
 
02:48:45.349 --> 02:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
years ago 30 40 years ago I guess it was
 
02:48:48.750 --> 02:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
on but our minimum wage hasn't changed
 
02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
so um and and the federal government and
 
02:48:53.230 --> 02:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
the state governments have to make up
 
02:48:57.190 --> 02:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
for that in the lower income groups so
 
02:49:00.550 --> 02:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's a very difficult problem I agree
 
02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
but what I wanted to ask you about was
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
02:49:08.269 --> 02:49:08.279 align:start position:0%
federal uh research and development tax
 
02:49:10.790 --> 02:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
credit which when we put in the federal
 
02:49:12.830 --> 02:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh the state tax credit I was
 
02:49:15.710 --> 02:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
instrumental in that um
 
02:49:18.910 --> 02:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
at a much lower level than it is now on
 
02:49:22.309 --> 02:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
was a great deal higher than the one
 
02:49:25.550 --> 02:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
coming from New Hampshire what
 
02:49:29.429 --> 02:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
percentage of of the
 
02:49:32.070 --> 02:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
total research and development tax
 
02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
credit that you get which is critical to
 
02:49:36.830 --> 02:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
your development what percentage of that
 
02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
is actually the the New Hampshire tax
 
02:49:43.150 --> 02:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
credit um at least in our in our case
 
02:49:45.229 --> 02:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire credits well the the
 
02:49:47.070 --> 02:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
amount that we get has varied when we
 
02:49:49.630 --> 02:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
first started taking the credit we were
 
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
getting somewhere on the order of like
 
02:49:55.790 --> 02:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
15 or 177% of whatever we put in uh for
 
02:49:58.190 --> 02:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
a credit because it had to be you know
 
02:49:59.750 --> 02:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
was limited by the the million dollars
 
02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
or $2 millionar right now we're getting
 
02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
about 85 or 90% of what we put in but um
 
02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire portion of the the
 
02:50:11.670 --> 02:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
total R&amp;D tax credit that we get Federal
 
02:50:14.229 --> 02:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
plus New Hampshire I think New Hampshire
 
02:50:15.830 --> 02:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
and I have to look at the numbers but
 
02:50:18.630 --> 02:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's probably like a 25% or so I mean
 
02:50:21.150 --> 02:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
it's the the federal the federal impact
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
is there's no limit to it um and at the
 
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
at the New Hampshire level chance I mean
 
02:50:29.630 --> 02:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
based on the the number of of companies
 
02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
that have put in we're relatively close
 
02:50:37.590 --> 02:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
to being able to um you know offer a
 
02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
credit equal to the amount that's been
 
02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
asked for I know there's some
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the in the actual amount
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
and we've certainly seen it over the
 
02:50:47.030 --> 02:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
years as we've gone from 1 million to2
 
02:50:49.150 --> 02:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
million to $7 million credit we've
 
02:50:51.429 --> 02:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
gotten closer to 100% of what we have
 
02:50:54.349 --> 02:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
put in for um and and applying for the
 
02:50:55.950 --> 02:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Credit is is fairly
 
02:50:57.550 --> 02:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward because it uses the
 
02:50:59.630 --> 02:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
Federal Form so if you're going to apply
 
02:51:02.349 --> 02:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
for the federal R&amp;D tax credit the the
 
02:51:05.110 --> 02:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
time it takes you to add the New
 
02:51:06.710 --> 02:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Credit on top of that is
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
minimal so it is a very simple system to
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
use um but it doesn't you know quite
 
02:51:14.830 --> 02:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
have as much of an impact as as the
 
02:51:17.070 --> 02:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Credit
 
02:51:20.670 --> 02:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
does Tom yes I I don't have the numbers
 
02:51:22.429 --> 02:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
but I can certainly get those for you
 
02:51:25.150 --> 02:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
but um and if you'd like I would do the
 
02:51:26.349 --> 02:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
research for you I don't have the
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
numbers to at the tip of my
 
02:51:31.830 --> 02:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
tongue I would love love to see that
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you because uh the 7 million is a
 
02:51:38.590 --> 02:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh drag on our budget for other things
 
02:51:43.670 --> 02:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
that you need and we need um but and
 
02:51:46.269 --> 02:51:46.279 align:start position:0%
I've been worried that it would be going
 
02:51:48.269 --> 02:51:48.279 align:start position:0%
up increasingly as more and more big
 
02:51:50.429 --> 02:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
businesses use it it was structured so
 
02:51:52.349 --> 02:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
that it would work better for the small
 
02:51:52.359 --> 02:51:54.670 align:start position:0%
that it would work better for the small
businesses

02:51:54.670 --> 02:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:51:57.510 --> 02:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
originally okay the next question is
 
02:52:00.870 --> 02:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:00.880 --> 02:52:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
amander

02:52:02.710 --> 02:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
amander
 
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
gor gorg gorg
 
02:52:09.389 --> 02:52:09.399 align:start position:0%
okay um I want to thank you all so much
 
02:52:12.990 --> 02:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh for uh giving a very realistic
 
02:52:14.990 --> 02:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
perspective on what's Happening I too am
 
02:52:17.190 --> 02:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
a small business owner on the Sea Coast
 
02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm curious as we're talking about
 
02:52:21.070 --> 02:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
wages I know it's very different
 
02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and we've gotten a
 
02:52:25.469 --> 02:52:25.479 align:start position:0%
lot of Statistics um over the past day
 
02:52:26.790 --> 02:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
02:52:31.150 --> 02:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
and you know where our income lies
 
02:52:33.670 --> 02:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
throughout you know where our um poorest
 
02:52:35.349 --> 02:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
people are where our more wealthier
 
02:52:37.590 --> 02:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
people are and I'm curious especially
 
02:52:39.190 --> 02:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
because you guys are on the other side
 
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
of the state how much as a range do you
 
02:52:45.429 --> 02:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
actually pay your employees
 
02:52:47.790 --> 02:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
if you're comfortable in saying
 
02:52:51.070 --> 02:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
this so in our case you know starting
 
02:52:54.830 --> 02:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
employees about 16 the most experienced
 
02:52:57.510 --> 02:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
person on the floor is probably getting
 
02:52:57.520 --> 02:52:58.830 align:start position:0%
person on the floor is probably getting
23

02:52:58.830 --> 02:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
23
 
02:53:02.309 --> 02:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
24 and right now uh we're operating on
 
02:53:05.910 --> 02:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
an overtime situation so uh you know
 
02:53:08.429 --> 02:53:08.439 align:start position:0%
they're adding another 10 hours a week
 
02:53:10.910 --> 02:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
at time and a half so um you know we
 
02:53:14.910 --> 02:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
have people that are making 50 to 60,000
 
02:53:18.110 --> 02:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
a year you know as Factory workers with
 
02:53:20.950 --> 02:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
um you know us paying 70% of the health
 
02:53:23.550 --> 02:53:23.560 align:start position:0%
insurance premium and having an ESOP
 
02:53:26.830 --> 02:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
plan in place and everything else so um
 
02:53:28.670 --> 02:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
you know and we've we've checked against
 
02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know the the market here looking at
 
02:53:33.750 --> 02:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
the state's uh you know input as to
 
02:53:35.309 --> 02:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
average wages for different types of
 
02:53:37.429 --> 02:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
jobs and different geographies so we try
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
to be you know slightly above the the
 
02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
average wage for the type of work that
 
02:53:44.550 --> 02:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
we have here so that we can be a little
 
02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
bit more competitive in in getting the
 
02:53:51.070 --> 02:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:54.510 --> 02:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
people joh in terms of the hourly I
 
02:53:57.150 --> 02:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned before hourly typically start
 
02:53:59.750 --> 02:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
and use a direct labor people anywhere
 
02:54:02.590 --> 02:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
between 18 and $20 an hour to
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
start as well but we have direct labor
 
02:54:08.670 --> 02:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
people making 21 $22 an hour we have a
 
02:54:10.469 --> 02:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
graded system that we bring in a third
 
02:54:13.269 --> 02:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
party to review our jobs so that uh and
 
02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
we also look at Regal um values what
 
02:54:18.790 --> 02:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
people are paying for an hourly job in
 
02:54:22.110 --> 02:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
say Burlington or nashv whatever we want
 
02:54:24.790 --> 02:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
to be as a company the the company of
 
02:54:27.710 --> 02:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
choice so we try to typically pay more
 
02:54:30.590 --> 02:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
than any of our competition we we also
 
02:54:32.510 --> 02:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
have course exempt employees that could
 
02:54:37.309 --> 02:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
be making up to 60 70 80 $90,000 a year
 
02:54:38.670 --> 02:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
depending on where they are whether
 
02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:40.279 align:start position:0%
they're Engineers or whatever they may
 
02:54:42.910 --> 02:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
be because again we have a wide spectrum
 
02:54:45.269 --> 02:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
of type of jobs this type of company
 
02:54:47.550 --> 02:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
yeah even in my small company of 21
 
02:54:49.950 --> 02:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
people I have salaried employees making
 
02:54:53.710 --> 02:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
70 80,000 a year
 
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
so and I can tell you here um at our
 
02:54:59.710 --> 02:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
organization um everyone is you know
 
02:55:01.590 --> 02:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
everyone we don't have hourly hourly
 
02:55:03.550 --> 02:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
folks they're all exempt and you know
 
02:55:05.429 --> 02:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
they range from coming in you know
 
02:55:08.910 --> 02:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
beginning 34 $35,000 a year up to as
 
02:55:11.229 --> 02:55:11.239 align:start position:0%
high as Val had said you know 75 $80,000
 
02:55:13.269 --> 02:55:13.279 align:start position:0%
a year not you know non- senior level
 
02:55:15.309 --> 02:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
people but just you know coming in and
 
02:55:18.190 --> 02:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
most of our our rates you know as as um
 
02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
Tom has said you know they're
 
02:55:21.429 --> 02:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
market-based you know what do I need to
 
02:55:23.429 --> 02:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
pay to have the best of the best
 
02:55:24.870 --> 02:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
compared to my competition who's trying
 
02:55:26.950 --> 02:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
to take the people from me right I'm not
 
02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
gonna let a minimum wage drive that I'm
 
02:55:30.349 --> 02:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna let them the market
 
02:55:31.710 --> 02:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
drives that no different than what you'd
 
02:55:34.469 --> 02:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
sell your product for yeah and for our
 
02:55:36.389 --> 02:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
our our hourly wage people you can
 
02:55:38.429 --> 02:55:38.439 align:start position:0%
probably add five dollar an hour for
 
02:55:40.590 --> 02:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
benefits and taxes and things that we
 
02:55:43.590 --> 02:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
have to pay uh for every so effective
 
02:55:45.309 --> 02:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
cost of some somebody on the shop floor
 
02:55:49.229 --> 02:55:49.239 align:start position:0%
could be you know 22 to $30 an hour just
 
02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
on the benefits plus salary yeah if you
 
02:55:54.190 --> 02:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
if you add yeah if you add that into our
 
02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
our wage package as well Val yes correct
 
02:55:58.590 --> 02:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
because we as as the lossing group we
 
02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
pay 100% of our employees health
 
02:56:02.070 --> 02:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
insurance you know we pay uh we
 
02:56:04.990 --> 02:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
contribute 5% for a 401k we do a profit
 
02:56:06.309 --> 02:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
sharing every year to the extent we're
 
02:56:08.309 --> 02:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
able to so I mean that you you can add
 
02:56:10.710 --> 02:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
15 to 20% just on you know additional
 
02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
benefits you know over and and we we
 
02:56:16.750 --> 02:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
have to do that I mean I pay more in uh
 
02:56:19.070 --> 02:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
health insurance premium for my
 
02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
employees than the profit of my company
 
02:56:24.910 --> 02:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
so absolutely so so the health insurance
 
02:56:26.950 --> 02:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
premium exceeds the the bottom line
 
02:56:29.150 --> 02:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
profit at the end of the year I mean
 
02:56:32.429 --> 02:56:32.439 align:start position:0%
last year 2019 we made about
 
02:56:35.429 --> 02:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
$330,000 and I paid out $90,000 in
 
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
Insurance health insurance premiums so
 
02:56:40.910 --> 02:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
you know the the the cost of for us to
 
02:56:42.790 --> 02:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
run our businesses to do all the things
 
02:56:46.830 --> 02:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
we need to do uh insurances benefits
 
02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
competitive wages um it's it's it's
 
02:56:52.030 --> 02:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
quite quite high it's quite High plus I
 
02:56:53.710 --> 02:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
have all the fixed expenses I have you
 
02:56:55.870 --> 02:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
know electricity and equipment and you
 
02:56:58.590 --> 02:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
know all the you know leases and things
 
02:57:00.950 --> 02:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
I pay on equipment so it it uh you know
 
02:57:05.710 --> 02:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking upwards of 55 $60 an hour
 
02:57:08.030 --> 02:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
for every person on the floor of of
 
02:57:11.670 --> 02:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
total cost to support that person so I
 
02:57:14.750 --> 02:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know we try to price our our our
 
02:57:18.269 --> 02:57:18.279 align:start position:0%
product at about you know $100 per hour
 
02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
value so that the difference of 40 then
 
02:57:23.229 --> 02:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
pays for the the non-manufacturing
 
02:57:24.590 --> 02:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
people the office people the sales
 
02:57:26.190 --> 02:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
people the engineers and everything else
 
02:57:28.269 --> 02:57:28.279 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day you know if we
 
02:57:30.910 --> 02:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
have 3% left over on the bottom line
 
02:57:32.910 --> 02:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
we've had a successful
 
02:57:35.670 --> 02:57:35.680 align:start position:0%

04:00:04.590 --> 04:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
safe and that's a good thing I
 
04:00:07.670 --> 04:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
suppose um so our executive director
 
04:00:09.950 --> 04:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
Dean Kristen uh very much wish wishes he
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
could be here with you today but he uh
 
04:00:15.269 --> 04:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
has U Board of director meetings uh that
 
04:00:17.550 --> 04:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
he's attending to so um he has to be
 
04:00:19.710 --> 04:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
there and so I I get the pleasure of um
 
04:00:23.309 --> 04:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
filling in his shoes today and what what
 
04:00:26.189 --> 04:00:26.199 align:start position:0%
you've asked me to do is to um talk
 
04:00:27.910 --> 04:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
about the the housing market in New
 
04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and some of the issues related
 
04:00:34.630 --> 04:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
to the housing market so I've prepared a
 
04:00:37.269 --> 04:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
um a PowerPoint presentation which I've
 
04:00:39.149 --> 04:00:39.159 align:start position:0%
shared with Jen and I'm going to share
 
04:00:42.349 --> 04:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
that share my screen with you now and I
 
04:00:44.189 --> 04:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
believe you can see
 
04:00:47.710 --> 04:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
that it looks like it's coming up there
 
04:00:50.469 --> 04:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
it is there it is
 
04:00:53.830 --> 04:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay um so just first off for those of
 
04:00:56.469 --> 04:00:56.479 align:start position:0%
you who are perhaps unfamiliar with New
 
04:00:58.830 --> 04:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing uh we're not a state
 
04:01:00.910 --> 04:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
agency but we are created by state
 
04:01:02.630 --> 04:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
statutes uh we were created by the
 
04:01:05.110 --> 04:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
legislature in 1981 as a a
 
04:01:07.950 --> 04:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining public corporation uh so
 
04:01:07.960 --> 04:01:08.830 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining public corporation uh so
we're

04:01:08.830 --> 04:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:01:11.149 --> 04:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
an instrumentality that
 
04:01:14.149 --> 04:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh fulfills important governmental
 
04:01:16.110 --> 04:01:16.120 align:start position:0%
functions as defined by the legislature
 
04:01:18.429 --> 04:01:18.439 align:start position:0%
we have a nine member board of directors
 
04:01:19.790 --> 04:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
who are appointed by governor and
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
Council and there's our mission which
 
04:01:24.110 --> 04:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
you know basically is to help ensure
 
04:01:26.870 --> 04:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
that everyone in the state has a a safe
 
04:01:29.830 --> 04:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
decent and affordable place to live and
 
04:01:32.670 --> 04:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
we do that by administering a variety of
 
04:01:34.830 --> 04:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
different programs uh ranging from
 
04:01:37.149 --> 04:01:37.159 align:start position:0%

uh We've helped more than 50,000 New
 
04:02:33.389 --> 04:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families purchase homes we've
 
04:02:36.429 --> 04:02:36.439 align:start position:0%

direct assistance to tens of thousands
 
04:02:43.469 --> 04:02:43.479 align:start position:0%
of households and here's some some of
 
04:02:45.990 --> 04:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
the data from from this year this past
 
04:02:46.000 --> 04:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
the data from from this year this past
year

04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:02:50.910 --> 04:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
fy2020 so we're we're an active
 
04:02:53.790 --> 04:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
organization um and we have an impact on
 
04:02:56.830 --> 04:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
the N Hampshire uh economy on something
 
04:02:59.830 --> 04:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
on the order of $700 million uh every
 
04:03:02.750 --> 04:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
year uh and so that's uh we're we're
 
04:03:04.750 --> 04:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
we're an important part of uh what goes
 
04:03:06.269 --> 04:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
on in the real estate market in New
 
04:03:08.189 --> 04:03:08.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's a mission that we
 
04:03:09.910 --> 04:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
take very
 
04:03:12.309 --> 04:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
seriously um now with regard to the the
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
housing market I'll I'll talk about the
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
rental market um a little later on but I
 
04:03:18.510 --> 04:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
want to start with the discussion about
 
04:03:20.590 --> 04:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
uh the the purchase market and what's
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
going on there and well what is going on
 
04:03:26.830 --> 04:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
there that's a really good question um
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
it we we read the headlines and the the
 
04:03:31.590 --> 04:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
newspapers and the my goodness the the
 
04:03:35.149 --> 04:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
market is is redh hot
 
04:03:37.510 --> 04:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
um a a colleague of mine in our home
 
04:03:40.870 --> 04:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
ownership Vision um I like to say that
 
04:03:45.790 --> 04:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh that November is the new June uh
 
04:03:49.070 --> 04:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
and typically speaking we would see uh
 
04:03:51.510 --> 04:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
prices falling off in the winter months
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
starting in in know October November
 
04:03:55.750 --> 04:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
because people just weren't purchasing
 
04:03:57.630 --> 04:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a lot of demand they're
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're going up now not going down uh
 
04:04:03.710 --> 04:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
and and there's a lot of reasons this
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
might be happening but and we'll take a
 
04:04:06.750 --> 04:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
look at a couple of those but you can
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
see that uh the November figures are up
 
04:04:13.510 --> 04:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
177% over November of
 
04:04:16.429 --> 04:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
2019 uh December figures just came out
 
04:04:18.110 --> 04:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty much the same thing up
 
04:04:22.349 --> 04:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
up about 177% um between December 2020
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
and December 2019 and that's the that's
 
04:04:27.790 --> 04:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
the median sales price of a single
 
04:04:31.870 --> 04:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
family home in New Hampshire um it's U
 
04:04:33.630 --> 04:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
the market is different it's behaving
 
04:04:36.229 --> 04:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
differently than it has uh traditionally
 
04:04:38.149 --> 04:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
and we're fascinated to figure figure
 
04:04:42.710 --> 04:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
out why that is well part of the issue
 
04:04:45.469 --> 04:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
is um you know the it's it is a classic
 
04:04:48.429 --> 04:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
supply and demand issue uh listings are
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
down substantially and this is
 
04:04:53.630 --> 04:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
particularly uh impacting the the lower
 
04:04:55.389 --> 04:04:55.399 align:start position:0%
end of the market and by lower end I
 
04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
mean U Homes that sell for $300,000 or
 
04:05:02.110 --> 04:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
less uh and for the first time in an
 
04:05:05.030 --> 04:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
awfully long time that inventory has has
 
04:05:05.040 --> 04:05:06.030 align:start position:0%
awfully long time that inventory has has
fallen

04:05:06.030 --> 04:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
fallen
 
04:05:10.750 --> 04:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
below um uh the the the uh homes that
 
04:05:12.149 --> 04:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
are available above
 
04:05:14.510 --> 04:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
$300,000 now part of that's we we're not
 
04:05:16.229 --> 04:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
controlling for inflation here so that
 
04:05:18.389 --> 04:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
might yield a a slightly different um
 
04:05:22.269 --> 04:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
graph but the fact is uh that the the
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
price the homes available on the market
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
that are listed on the market at below
 
04:05:30.389 --> 04:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
$300,000 are very few and far in between
 
04:05:32.550 --> 04:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
they're hard to find and that has an
 
04:05:34.870 --> 04:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
impact on in particular first-time home
 
04:05:36.910 --> 04:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
buyers who haven't developed Equity
 
04:05:38.710 --> 04:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
they're not moving up they're trying to
 
04:05:40.990 --> 04:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
get the the foothold into uh the
 
04:05:42.790 --> 04:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
purchase market and it is really really
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:50.070 --> 04:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
do um closed sales Well yeah if you if
 
04:05:51.870 --> 04:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
you look at the way things have been
 
04:05:54.309 --> 04:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
over the past couple years again we
 
04:05:56.189 --> 04:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
would see the sales dropping off in the
 
04:05:58.630 --> 04:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
winter months that is not happening now
 
04:06:01.030 --> 04:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
even though the inventory is low sales
 
04:06:03.309 --> 04:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
are still very high uh it's kind of a
 
04:06:06.309 --> 04:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
conundrum where that that has has
 
04:06:09.870 --> 04:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
implications on the prices uh so again
 
04:06:13.149 --> 04:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:17.950 --> 04:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
demand um the amount of time that a a
 
04:06:21.429 --> 04:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
house might spend on the market now I've
 
04:06:22.590 --> 04:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
I've lived in a number of different
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
homes and sold them from time to time as
 
04:06:26.630 --> 04:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
I've moved from place to place sometimes
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
I've been really lucky and and sold it
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
one house I sold the day before it came
 
04:06:32.790 --> 04:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
on the market but that's really what's
 
04:06:35.469 --> 04:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
happening right now um a lot of homes
 
04:06:37.309 --> 04:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
are being scooped up as soon as they
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
come on the market Market the average
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
right now is uh under one month uh which
 
04:06:48.950 --> 04:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
fast this is um the the months to absorb
 
04:06:55.070 --> 04:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
inventory is a um kind of an industry
 
04:06:58.429 --> 04:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
standard way of looking at the inventory
 
04:07:01.870 --> 04:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh and this is the uh the amount of time
 
04:07:03.790 --> 04:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
it would take to sell the current
 
04:07:07.070 --> 04:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
inventory at the preceding 12 months
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
pace of sale
 
04:07:11.070 --> 04:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
now recognize that the first half of
 
04:07:13.710 --> 04:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
2020 was kind of slow for obvious
 
04:07:16.110 --> 04:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
reasons but then starting the the middle
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
of the summer really picked up fast so
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
if we were to look at the current um
 
04:07:22.750 --> 04:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
pace of sales it would be substantially
 
04:07:24.870 --> 04:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
less than what's shown here it would be
 
04:07:28.389 --> 04:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
less than uh 9/10 of a month uh for
 
04:07:30.910 --> 04:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
those properties under 300,000 less than
 
04:07:34.109 --> 04:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
1.2 months for the properties for all
 
04:07:38.429 --> 04:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
properties um this is uh
 
04:07:41.389 --> 04:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
it's um it's really shocking what's
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:50.109 --> 04:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
market and what's driving this interest
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
rates this is the principal driver there
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
are other factors too but the very low
 
04:07:57.550 --> 04:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
interest rates that we're facing the
 
04:07:59.670 --> 04:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
historically low interest rates that
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
have that consumers have available to
 
04:08:04.269 --> 04:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
them is what is driving uh the market
 
04:08:06.830 --> 04:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
right now U so you see this interest
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
rate at at 2.68 and this is a national
 
04:08:12.109 --> 04:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
survey done by Freddy Mack um this is
 
04:08:15.149 --> 04:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
the lowest it has been since Freddy Mack
 
04:08:18.030 --> 04:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
started doing this in
 
04:08:21.389 --> 04:08:21.399 align:start position:0%
1971 it's really low and you might have
 
04:08:23.910 --> 04:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
heard um fed chairman Jerome Powell last
 
04:08:27.670 --> 04:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
week say um that uh the FED is not
 
04:08:30.389 --> 04:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
exiting this strategy anytime soon so
 
04:08:33.070 --> 04:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
the the federal funds rate is close to
 
04:08:34.870 --> 04:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
zero it's going to stay there for the
 
04:08:36.790 --> 04:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future until conditions
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:45.109 --> 04:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
I want to take a moment to talk about
 
04:08:47.109 --> 04:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
foreclosures because this has been in
 
04:08:49.469 --> 04:08:49.479 align:start position:0%
our minds for a long time since the the
 
04:08:51.109 --> 04:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
Great Recession and the Foreclosure
 
04:08:53.149 --> 04:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
crisis that so many families in New
 
04:08:56.269 --> 04:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire been nationally faced um you
 
04:09:01.830 --> 04:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
during the the four years uh dur of the
 
04:09:03.870 --> 04:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
technically speaking the recession was a
 
04:09:07.790 --> 04:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
a you know like 12 14 months but uh the
 
04:09:09.630 --> 04:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
the four years in and around the
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
recession uh roughly 20,000 New
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families lost their homes to
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
we've seen this trend going down uh
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
slowly over time as the economy has
 
04:09:22.030 --> 04:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
improved uh as people's employment and
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
income situations have improved as
 
04:09:26.830 --> 04:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
people have gotten their their financial
 
04:09:29.630 --> 04:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
feet under them more firmly uh we've
 
04:09:31.950 --> 04:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
seen a drop off in in
 
04:09:35.429 --> 04:09:35.439 align:start position:0%
foreclosures um even and and right now
 
04:09:37.149 --> 04:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
things are very different because we
 
04:09:40.790 --> 04:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
have the option of uh forbearance for
 
04:09:42.349 --> 04:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
anyone who has a federally backed
 
04:09:44.590 --> 04:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
mortgage and in earlier in the year
 
04:09:47.189 --> 04:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
there was the Foreclosure moratorium U
 
04:09:49.149 --> 04:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
that that also had a significant impact
 
04:09:51.990 --> 04:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
on what was going on here obviously uh
 
04:09:54.149 --> 04:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
prior to that we would have estimated uh
 
04:09:57.149 --> 04:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
we did estimate that we expected to see
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
um something on the order of 600
 
04:10:01.550 --> 04:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
foreclosures in New Hampshire uh in
 
04:10:04.670 --> 04:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
20120 uh it turns out and this is U not
 
04:10:07.750 --> 04:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
complete data for the year but turn out
 
04:10:09.109 --> 04:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at something on the
 
04:10:11.309 --> 04:10:11.319 align:start position:0%
order of 250 or
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
275 when we compile those data um but
 
04:10:18.269 --> 04:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
the you know this is the the important
 
04:10:21.550 --> 04:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
thing to consider here is uh this is
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
really a sell's market so there's really
 
04:10:28.630 --> 04:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
not a good reason for anyone to be uh
 
04:10:31.149 --> 04:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
faced with the prospect of foreclosure
 
04:10:33.309 --> 04:10:33.319 align:start position:0%
if you have to sell your house you
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
should be able to sell your house in
 
04:10:37.670 --> 04:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
this market what we're seeing is that
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
most of the the foreclosures that are
 
04:10:41.189 --> 04:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
going on right now the few that are
 
04:10:43.590 --> 04:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
happening are of properties that have
 
04:10:46.189 --> 04:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
been abandoned so the owners have simply
 
04:10:48.670 --> 04:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
left and they've they've turned it over
 
04:10:51.950 --> 04:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
to the bank to deal with um it may also
 
04:10:54.910 --> 04:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
be the case where uh we're seeing some
 
04:10:57.790 --> 04:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
level of foreclosures uh in properties
 
04:11:00.550 --> 04:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
that don't have Federal backing uh and
 
04:11:04.750 --> 04:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
so so that aren't backed by FHA or Fanny
 
04:11:08.830 --> 04:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
or Freddy or the VA um and and that and
 
04:11:12.189 --> 04:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
that's about 30% of the
 
04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
um First Mortgage Market in New
 
04:11:17.349 --> 04:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and a lot of those may be
 
04:11:19.070 --> 04:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing as well because
 
04:11:20.910 --> 04:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
they're most of them are not eligible
 
04:11:24.109 --> 04:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
for federally backed mortgages um that
 
04:11:25.830 --> 04:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
may change in the future but that's the
 
04:11:25.840 --> 04:11:26.990 align:start position:0%
may change in the future but that's the
situation

04:11:26.990 --> 04:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:11:27.000 --> 04:11:31.469 align:start position:0%
situation
now

04:11:31.469 --> 04:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:35.309 --> 04:11:35.319 align:start position:0%
um I have read for the past several
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
months since the summertime uh countless
 
04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
articles headlines uh statements from
 
04:11:44.550 --> 04:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
Realtors and journalists and reporters
 
04:11:46.550 --> 04:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's the Massachusetts buyers that are
 
04:11:48.349 --> 04:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
driving the market in New
 
04:11:50.990 --> 04:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so we started looking at
 
04:11:54.269 --> 04:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
these data and um you know over the past
 
04:11:56.349 --> 04:11:56.359 align:start position:0%
five years roughly three qus of all
 
04:11:59.070 --> 04:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
purchasers in New Hampshire came from
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire someplace in New Hampshire
 
04:12:04.510 --> 04:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh 15% over that period came from
 
04:12:06.149 --> 04:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and every other state
 
04:12:07.830 --> 04:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
contributed uh
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
about 1% or less for a total of 100% now
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
compare the the annual data over the
 
04:12:17.469 --> 04:12:17.479 align:start position:0%
past five years and my question to you
 
04:12:19.349 --> 04:12:19.359 align:start position:0%
is is this a flood of home buyers from
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I don't think so there's
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
been an uptick certainly in the number
 
04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
of the the proportion of buyers from
 
04:12:28.950 --> 04:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but it's certainly not a
 
04:12:31.790 --> 04:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
flood uh this is and the the 2020 data
 
04:12:35.670 --> 04:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
are through uh mid October um and so
 
04:12:37.990 --> 04:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll continue to Analyze This but
 
04:12:40.149 --> 04:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
I don't really expect this to tr to
 
04:12:42.590 --> 04:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
change dramatically uh what's what's
 
04:12:45.030 --> 04:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
going on here it's not so much the
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts buyers although they may
 
04:12:50.309 --> 04:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
have an impact on the higher end of the
 
04:12:52.389 --> 04:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
market so there may be some price
 
04:12:54.910 --> 04:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
stratification going on here where the
 
04:12:57.109 --> 04:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
buyers from Massachusetts are competing
 
04:13:00.229 --> 04:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
more for the um the higher end housing
 
04:13:02.670 --> 04:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
and less for the lower end housing
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
really I think what the the greater
 
04:13:06.630 --> 04:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
impact on New Hampshire is is not in the
 
04:13:09.030 --> 04:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
purchase of homes by people from out of
 
04:13:12.510 --> 04:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
state but the occupancy of those homes
 
04:13:14.910 --> 04:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
by people who already own their second
 
04:13:17.229 --> 04:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
homes they may be working in in Metro
 
04:13:21.070 --> 04:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
Boston and they decide you know uh March
 
04:13:23.469 --> 04:13:23.479 align:start position:0%
comes around the pandemic strikes and
 
04:13:25.389 --> 04:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
they say well we're pulling the family
 
04:13:26.790 --> 04:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
put taking the kids out where they're
 
04:13:28.990 --> 04:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
learning remotely anyway taking the kids
 
04:13:31.469 --> 04:13:31.479 align:start position:0%
to go to our Lake home on on
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
winaki and and and I think that that is
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
having an impact and early on we heard
 
04:13:39.229 --> 04:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
from people in the North Country um you
 
04:13:41.309 --> 04:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
know there are people here now who
 
04:13:43.950 --> 04:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
aren't normally here and they were
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
saying that in March April May those are
 
04:13:50.550 --> 04:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
the people who vacation up north um
 
04:13:52.229 --> 04:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
don't live up North but they're living
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
up north right now and that definitely
 
04:13:57.630 --> 04:13:57.640 align:start position:0%
does have an impact on New Hampshire but
 
04:14:00.750 --> 04:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
not so much an impact on the home buying
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
market now let me turn to um the
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
resident the rental market and take a
 
04:14:06.479 --> 04:14:07.710 align:start position:0%
resident the rental market and take a
few

04:14:07.710 --> 04:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
few
 
04:14:09.630 --> 04:14:09.640 align:start position:0%
take a a look at
 
04:14:12.349 --> 04:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
that and most of the data that I have
 
04:14:14.590 --> 04:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
here comes from our New Hampshire
 
04:14:16.830 --> 04:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
housing's residential rental cost survey
 
04:14:19.429 --> 04:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
which we do every year we survey uh
 
04:14:22.670 --> 04:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
landlords uh and the the data set is
 
04:14:25.870 --> 04:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
about 20,000 units we filter out some
 
04:14:28.950 --> 04:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
anomalous figures and control for size
 
04:14:31.870 --> 04:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh so we use a sample of about uh 12,000
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
units so it's a very robust survey uh
 
04:14:37.830 --> 04:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
and really the best source of rental um
 
04:14:40.269 --> 04:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
data that we have from any any any
 
04:14:43.590 --> 04:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
source and what you see in the rental uh
 
04:14:47.790 --> 04:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
price trends is this slow steady
 
04:14:51.550 --> 04:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
inexurable it seems Trend upward um and
 
04:14:54.510 --> 04:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to go back farther in time uh
 
04:14:56.710 --> 04:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
through the Great Recession back into
 
04:14:59.389 --> 04:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
the early 2000s back into the mid 90s
 
04:15:03.229 --> 04:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
you would see this steady trend of price
 
04:15:05.550 --> 04:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
increases so even during the Great
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
Recession and you think about that well
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know I said earlier you know roughly
 
04:15:11.750 --> 04:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
20,000 New Hampshire families lost their
 
04:15:13.790 --> 04:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
homes to foreclosure a good number of
 
04:15:15.950 --> 04:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
those went into the renter market so
 
04:15:19.429 --> 04:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
that that um uh had a significant impact
 
04:15:21.030 --> 04:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
on price and
 
04:15:21.040 --> 04:15:22.950 align:start position:0%
on price and
availability

04:15:22.950 --> 04:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
availability
 
04:15:26.429 --> 04:15:26.439 align:start position:0%
um so you see this this ongoing Trend
 
04:15:29.870 --> 04:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
and part of this is reflected to uh
 
04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
geographically you know the the four uh
 
04:15:35.429 --> 04:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
Southeastern counties in the state it's
 
04:15:37.590 --> 04:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
where the bulk of the people live it's
 
04:15:39.389 --> 04:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
where the bulk of the housing units are
 
04:15:40.990 --> 04:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
and that's where the the bulk of the
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
cost is so Rockingham straford marac and
 
04:15:46.269 --> 04:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro counties and you see the uh
 
04:15:49.070 --> 04:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
the change in prices occurring there uh
 
04:15:51.630 --> 04:15:51.640 align:start position:0%
pretty substantially you know 20 28%
 
04:15:54.389 --> 04:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
increase over five years um in
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County 26% in hillsbor County
 
04:16:00.189 --> 04:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
but go up to Coos County too uh at 12
 
04:16:01.590 --> 04:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
and a half percent increase that's a
 
04:16:03.990 --> 04:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
pretty healthy increase and it's a good
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
for the property owners uh tougher for
 
04:16:07.590 --> 04:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
the rent
 
04:16:10.269 --> 04:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
certainly um it it said you know Coos
 
04:16:12.830 --> 04:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
County obviously has the lowest median
 
04:16:15.109 --> 04:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
rental cost of any county in the state
 
04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
and it's often said well that makes it
 
04:16:18.550 --> 04:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
the most
 
04:16:21.910 --> 04:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
affordable well in comparison to
 
04:16:25.070 --> 04:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide incomes yeah it is but if
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the incomes of the
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
people who live in each County coas
 
04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
county is actually the least affordable
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
county in the state uh housing problems
 
04:16:38.349 --> 04:16:38.359 align:start position:0%
exist all over the the
 
04:16:41.070 --> 04:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
state um I also would want to point out
 
04:16:44.510 --> 04:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
Grafton county is uh very much a tale of
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
two maybe three counties uh because you
 
04:16:49.950 --> 04:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
have Handover and Levan in the southwest
 
04:16:52.109 --> 04:16:52.119 align:start position:0%
corner of the of the county which are
 
04:16:55.030 --> 04:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
really driving a local economy there a
 
04:16:58.189 --> 04:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
local housing market and increase
 
04:17:01.950 --> 04:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
overall the the median and uh that we
 
04:17:03.790 --> 04:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
see represented here elsewhere in
 
04:17:06.149 --> 04:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
Grafton County uh the rents would be
 
04:17:10.349 --> 04:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
locations um a another aspect of the
 
04:17:15.469 --> 04:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
rental market is the vacancy rates and
 
04:17:17.790 --> 04:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
we consider a you know a 5% vacancy rate
 
04:17:19.790 --> 04:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
to be something where the market is
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
balanced between the interests of the
 
04:17:24.030 --> 04:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
landlords and the tenants uh 3% is
 
04:17:26.269 --> 04:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
pretty much a turnover measure it's the
 
04:17:29.429 --> 04:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
time that a landlord has to take to
 
04:17:31.670 --> 04:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
prepare a unit for a new tenant after an
 
04:17:33.070 --> 04:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
old one moves
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
out and you look for the past seven
 
04:17:39.510 --> 04:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
years we've had a Statewide vacancy rate
 
04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
of below
 
04:17:44.070 --> 04:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
3% uh this is not an indicator of a
 
04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
healthy rental market uh it's an
 
04:17:50.109 --> 04:17:50.119 align:start position:0%
indication that uh Supply is is
 
04:17:54.149 --> 04:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:56.790 --> 04:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
demand uh the increase that we see
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
between 2019 and 2020 of 1% from8 to 1.8
 
04:18:06.149 --> 04:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
that's perhaps a good sign it may be an
 
04:18:08.510 --> 04:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
anomalous Trend uh but we'll we'll take
 
04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
it as good news and and and maybe this
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
is attributable to the uh the multif
 
04:18:15.830 --> 04:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
family construction that's been going on
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
in places like um you know London Derry
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
and in the Sea
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
Coast that remains to be
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
seen and if you look at the vacancy
 
04:18:30.309 --> 04:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
rates by County you see that um they're
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
low everywhere uh there's there's no
 
04:18:35.910 --> 04:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
exception to this case and in comparison
 
04:18:38.510 --> 04:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
to uh the the region the Northeast
 
04:18:40.870 --> 04:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
region and the United States as a whole
 
04:18:44.349 --> 04:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
our uh vacancy rates are way below uh
 
04:18:47.870 --> 04:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:51.750 --> 04:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
averages and this all has U an impact on
 
04:18:53.910 --> 04:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
affordability um if you're making the
 
04:18:56.630 --> 04:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
median income of the state you know so
 
04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
82,000 for a family of three you can
 
04:19:00.550 --> 04:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
afford pretty much everything that's on
 
04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
the market at a 30% cost burden but if
 
04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
you're making only half the median uh
 
04:19:06.359 --> 04:19:07.590 align:start position:0%
you're making only half the median uh
for

04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
,000 you can't afford a whole lot you
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
can afford 11% of what's on the market
 
04:19:14.269 --> 04:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
and if you're making
 
04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
$25,000 you can't afford just about
 
04:19:19.590 --> 04:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
anything that's on the market uh and
 
04:19:22.149 --> 04:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
recognize that as the the less money you
 
04:19:27.030 --> 04:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
make um that that 30% consumes uh
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
relatively more uh because you have less
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
actual money left after your rent has
 
04:19:35.670 --> 04:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
been paid there's a common expression
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
now in in um in some Circles of
 
04:19:42.590 --> 04:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
Advocates and and academics uh that the
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
rent eats first uh so for people who um
 
04:19:49.309 --> 04:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
are faced with the the the prospect well
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pay my rent or am I going
 
04:19:53.149 --> 04:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
to pay my auto insurance or make that
 
04:19:56.429 --> 04:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
auto repair I'm GNA pay the rent first
 
04:19:58.189 --> 04:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh and then whatever is left after that
 
04:20:00.109 --> 04:20:00.119 align:start position:0%
goes to the auto insurance the health
 
04:20:02.149 --> 04:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
insurance the medical bills the
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
prescriptions food for your
 
04:20:05.560 --> 04:20:09.830 align:start position:0%
prescriptions food for your
kids

04:20:09.830 --> 04:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:15.309 --> 04:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
so um if if the demand is so high and um
 
04:20:17.590 --> 04:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
why aren't Builders building well you
 
04:20:19.070 --> 04:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
can see the builders really are not
 
04:20:20.910 --> 04:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
building at anywhere near the pace that
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
they had been before the black line is
 
04:20:25.149 --> 04:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
single family homes the the brown line
 
04:20:27.750 --> 04:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
is multif family and this is units U
 
04:20:27.760 --> 04:20:28.590 align:start position:0%
is multif family and this is units U
being

04:20:28.590 --> 04:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:20:33.109 --> 04:20:33.119 align:start position:0%
permitted um so a 10 unit multif family
 
04:20:36.189 --> 04:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
uh project would be counted as 10 units
 
04:20:38.750 --> 04:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh on this graph uh and we just haven't
 
04:20:40.870 --> 04:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
recovered the market has not recovered
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
the development Market has not recovered
 
04:20:45.149 --> 04:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
since the Great Recession um for a
 
04:20:48.349 --> 04:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons um which we're still
 
04:20:52.269 --> 04:20:52.279 align:start position:0%
exploring this really is fundamentally a
 
04:20:54.389 --> 04:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
question of supply and demand the
 
04:20:57.030 --> 04:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
question is why why aren't Builders
 
04:20:59.070 --> 04:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
building well my my colleague here at
 
04:21:00.630 --> 04:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing George Regan likes
 
04:21:04.109 --> 04:21:04.119 align:start position:0%
to cite the the five L's that he calls
 
04:21:06.269 --> 04:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
as he calls them and some of these we
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
can we can have some influence over
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
others we can't influence so much we
 
04:21:12.870 --> 04:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
can't influence the cost of lumber and
 
04:21:14.550 --> 04:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
other other construction materials we
 
04:21:17.309 --> 04:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
can't really influence Supply chains
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
that much um we can influence somewhat
 
04:21:23.910 --> 04:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
more uh Workforce availability through
 
04:21:26.590 --> 04:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh training programs and the like or um
 
04:21:28.590 --> 04:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
Financial incentives maybe to certain
 
04:21:30.670 --> 04:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
industries but there's there's just so
 
04:21:33.630 --> 04:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
much we can do there as well Banks Banks
 
04:21:36.910 --> 04:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
are ready to lend uh to any developer ER
 
04:21:39.510 --> 04:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
who's willing to have taken the risk uh
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
banks are will are willing to lend for
 
04:21:44.269 --> 04:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
projects that are ready to go uh and
 
04:21:46.149 --> 04:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
that's really the the issue uh
 
04:21:48.830 --> 04:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
developers have to take the risk upfront
 
04:21:51.830 --> 04:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
before they can get Bank financing and I
 
04:21:53.550 --> 04:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you that's not a business I
 
04:21:55.550 --> 04:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
would want to be in I don't I I don't
 
04:21:57.870 --> 04:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
have that appetite for risk that uh that
 
04:22:01.389 --> 04:22:01.399 align:start position:0%
developers do um and that and it is a a
 
04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
significant risk for any developer to
 
04:22:06.429 --> 04:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
pursue uh a project it may cost several
 
04:22:08.269 --> 04:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
$1,000 just to get through the
 
04:22:10.030 --> 04:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
permitting process before they even get
 
04:22:11.870 --> 04:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
to bank financing to
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
build um so what's the risk here well
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
land costs yeah can can we control the
 
04:22:20.750 --> 04:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
market no or can
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
we regulatory practices in particular at
 
04:22:26.189 --> 04:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
the local level do have a significant
 
04:22:29.389 --> 04:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
impact on the cost of land uh and so to
 
04:22:33.070 --> 04:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
the degree we want to influence costs of
 
04:22:35.590 --> 04:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
land and reduce developers risk and
 
04:22:38.149 --> 04:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
increase the supply of housing we have
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
to deal with in particular local
 
04:22:40.680 --> 04:22:42.349 align:start position:0%
to deal with in particular local
regulatory

04:22:42.349 --> 04:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
practices and it's both zoning and
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
subdivision regulations and site plan
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
regulations and how they are implemented
 
04:22:52.710 --> 04:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
by the boards that do
 
04:22:55.830 --> 04:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
this so just to summarize all of this we
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
have a couple of uh really important
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
issues very high demand that's fueled by
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
interest rates um and I didn't cover it
 
04:23:05.149 --> 04:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
here but there is some evidence of more
 
04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
conservative consumer Behavior after the
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
Great Recession not and I know you got a
 
04:23:11.750 --> 04:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
presentation this morning from Phil slon
 
04:23:14.349 --> 04:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
and he talked about still families not
 
04:23:17.030 --> 04:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
saving but their credit scores on
 
04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
average are a lot better now than they
 
04:23:21.510 --> 04:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
were uh during the Great Recession or
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
after the Great Recession they have
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
improved um people seem to have learned
 
04:23:28.910 --> 04:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
some better behaviors on average uh and
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
that puts them in a better position to
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
be able to buy a home and we're seeing
 
04:23:34.870 --> 04:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
some evidence of that now but we're also
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
likely to see a what we're calling a
 
04:23:39.550 --> 04:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
k-shaped recovery people on the higher
 
04:23:41.550 --> 04:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
end of the income Spectrum likely to do
 
04:23:44.790 --> 04:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
okay people lower down less likely to do
 
04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
okay we also have this constrained
 
04:23:49.710 --> 04:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
Supply as a as a significant issue uh
 
04:23:52.950 --> 04:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
underproduction for a long time has left
 
04:23:55.469 --> 04:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
us with a deficit we estimate to be uh
 
04:23:58.590 --> 04:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
20,000 units Statewide just to meet
 
04:24:00.630 --> 04:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
current demand forget about future
 
04:24:02.950 --> 04:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
growth this is just to bring balance
 
04:24:05.469 --> 04:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
back to the purchase and Rental markets
 
04:24:08.349 --> 04:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
we would need another 20,000 units and
 
04:24:10.030 --> 04:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
here are the the contri contributing
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
factors which I've already talked about
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:24:17.910 --> 04:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
implications uh chairman major you you
 
04:24:19.630 --> 04:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned yesterday in in one of the
 
04:24:22.030 --> 04:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
presentations I was listening to if we
 
04:24:24.349 --> 04:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
if we don't have housing we can't get
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
workers um that that's really a a
 
04:24:29.109 --> 04:24:29.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental problem that we face right
 
04:24:32.070 --> 04:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
now the housing Supply is having a
 
04:24:33.950 --> 04:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
negative impact on economic growth it's
 
04:24:36.990 --> 04:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
a constraint to economic growth
 
04:24:40.109 --> 04:24:40.119 align:start position:0%
and you we know how much we need to grow
 
04:24:43.630 --> 04:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
our economy uh to to among other things
 
04:24:47.109 --> 04:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
make lives better but also uh to to fund
 
04:24:49.950 --> 04:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
the state's budget um I focus in
 
04:24:53.349 --> 04:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
particular on the um the rental market
 
04:24:55.109 --> 04:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh we need to have a really what I would
 
04:24:57.870 --> 04:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
call a fluid rental market uh because it
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
helps with labor Mobility it provides an
 
04:25:02.510 --> 04:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to move into a
 
04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
town before they decide what they want
 
04:25:06.750 --> 04:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
to buy where they want to buy you get a
 
04:25:09.950 --> 04:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
job um say you get aob two job offers
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
one in um in Lebanon and one somewhere
 
04:25:16.389 --> 04:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
in Ohio um and you look at the housing
 
04:25:18.189 --> 04:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
market in Lebanon and you say well I I
 
04:25:20.349 --> 04:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
can't even afford a place to rent I'm G
 
04:25:22.630 --> 04:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
to take that job in Ohio and you got a
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
20% raise without actually making any
 
04:25:28.550 --> 04:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
more money uh and I've said this already
 
04:25:31.389 --> 04:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
but the uh affordability issues that are
 
04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
um propounded by this um lack of supply
 
04:25:37.389 --> 04:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
has the greatest impact on people of
 
04:25:39.429 --> 04:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
lower income it affects their stability
 
04:25:42.309 --> 04:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
of housing it affects the their kids uh
 
04:25:44.510 --> 04:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
and threatens them with homelessness
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
these are problems that we we have to
 
04:25:49.349 --> 04:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
deal with um there I don't want to leave
 
04:25:52.109 --> 04:25:52.119 align:start position:0%
it on on that dark note um so let me
 
04:25:54.109 --> 04:25:54.119 align:start position:0%
just give you a couple of possible
 
04:25:56.990 --> 04:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
solutions uh one uh the legislature has
 
04:25:59.149 --> 04:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
already done and this is the uh
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
establishment of the housing appeals
 
04:26:04.550 --> 04:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
board to make it easier for U people who
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
face adverse decisions Lo
 
04:26:10.590 --> 04:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
to get a day in court uh using the same
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
legal standards uh that Superior Court
 
04:26:15.990 --> 04:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
applies but doing it in a a faster more
 
04:26:18.550 --> 04:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
efficient manner than the courts can do
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh the housing appeals board opened its
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
doors to appeals just last week um and
 
04:26:26.469 --> 04:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
another one is um representative Joe
 
04:26:29.389 --> 04:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
Alexander's uh bill which is a house
 
04:26:32.590 --> 04:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
bill 586 this is a combination of two
 
04:26:35.149 --> 04:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
bills that uh were making their way
 
04:26:37.349 --> 04:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
through the legisl last year in fact one
 
04:26:39.550 --> 04:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
of them had just come out of the the
 
04:26:41.030 --> 04:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
house Ways and Means Committee with a
 
04:26:43.229 --> 04:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
unanimous ought to pass with Amendment
 
04:26:46.109 --> 04:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation um and both it looked
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
like we're going to proceed um and get
 
04:26:52.109 --> 04:26:52.119 align:start position:0%
get adopted but then they they like so
 
04:26:54.990 --> 04:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
many other worthy bills um fell victim
 
04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
to covid uh representative Alexander has
 
04:27:00.750 --> 04:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
combined those two bills in this one uh
 
04:27:02.389 --> 04:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation which will go to
 
04:27:03.870 --> 04:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
the house Municipal and County
 
04:27:06.550 --> 04:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
government uh committee sometimes soon
 
04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
so I look forward to seeing how that
 
04:27:11.950 --> 04:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
works and I'll be happy to take any
 
04:27:14.429 --> 04:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
questions and try to give some
 
04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
answers well thank
 
04:27:21.389 --> 04:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
you a you provided us a lot of good
 
04:27:24.630 --> 04:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
information on our state of our
 
04:27:28.030 --> 04:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
housing uh we do have at least three
 
04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
hands up the first questioner is
 
04:27:34.910 --> 04:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.920 --> 04:27:37.109 align:start position:0%
 
brahney

04:27:37.109 --> 04:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
brahney
 
04:27:39.109 --> 04:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
R you have to unmute got it I got it
 
04:27:41.590 --> 04:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks Norm uh great presentation
 
04:27:45.070 --> 04:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh back to the five L's I
 
04:27:48.109 --> 04:27:48.119 align:start position:0%
like that the five L's um I think we
 
04:27:49.830 --> 04:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
could do something about Labor we talked
 
04:27:51.149 --> 04:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
about a bit yesterday in terms of
 
04:27:53.950 --> 04:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
training and all that uh the laws we've
 
04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
heard this in the past about uh
 
04:27:57.590 --> 04:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
permitting and I've heard it directly
 
04:28:00.590 --> 04:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
from Builders and uh drill depends on
 
04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
your town it gets pretty complicated
 
04:28:05.149 --> 04:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
what I what's a mystery to me is land I
 
04:28:07.830 --> 04:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
mean land I know our land the dirt
 
04:28:09.710 --> 04:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
itself is worth a lot especially in
 
04:28:11.590 --> 04:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
Rockingham where I
 
04:28:14.710 --> 04:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
am what's the hesitation what what's the
 
04:28:16.990 --> 04:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
hold back with the land is it is it the
 
04:28:19.830 --> 04:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
cost of the land or uh people unwilling
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
to sell their land um can you just
 
04:28:24.389 --> 04:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
Enlighten us a little bit on
 
04:28:27.550 --> 04:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
that well thank thanks representative I
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is a really good question it's not
 
04:28:32.670 --> 04:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
there's not a simple answer to this but
 
04:28:36.550 --> 04:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
the cost of land is uh part of the
 
04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
development equation uh so you might uh
 
04:28:42.349 --> 04:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
you might choose one parcel of land over
 
04:28:44.830 --> 04:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
another if you're a developer um but
 
04:28:47.910 --> 04:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
really the point I'm making here is that
 
04:28:51.070 --> 04:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
um the cost of land does not exist in
 
04:28:53.950 --> 04:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
isolation from other factors uh it is
 
04:28:56.510 --> 04:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
influenced by other factors a good part
 
04:28:59.950 --> 04:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
of it is simply market demand
 
04:29:02.590 --> 04:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
so all other things being equal
 
04:29:05.389 --> 04:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
including local regulation uh parcel of
 
04:29:05.399 --> 04:29:06.269 align:start position:0%
including local regulation uh parcel of
land

04:29:06.269 --> 04:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
land
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
in uh Rockingham County is going to be
 
04:29:12.510 --> 04:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
more valuable and and therefore more
 
04:29:14.670 --> 04:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
expensive to purchase than a parcel of
 
04:29:18.630 --> 04:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
land in say Coos County uh that's just
 
04:29:22.389 --> 04:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
the market um the question though is
 
04:29:24.189 --> 04:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
what is the influence of local
 
04:29:26.590 --> 04:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
regulation on the cost of land so you
 
04:29:28.750 --> 04:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
might say you know I've heard some towns
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
saying well we're built
 
04:29:33.269 --> 04:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
out according to your current
 
04:29:36.269 --> 04:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
regulations yes you're built out but if
 
04:29:38.030 --> 04:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
you if you're came up with different
 
04:29:40.030 --> 04:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
regulations then there's tremendous
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for additional development
 
04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh and some towns might say well we
 
04:29:45.750 --> 04:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
don't want that okay I get that that's
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
your choice but you you can't deny that
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
regulations don't have an impact on the
 
04:29:52.429 --> 04:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
cost of land and that's that's really
 
04:29:54.229 --> 04:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
the the point I'm making there okay
 
04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:30:03.670 --> 04:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
Ames thank you and thank you for that
 
04:30:03.680 --> 04:30:04.630 align:start position:0%
Ames thank you and thank you for that
great

04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:30:08.670 --> 04:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
presentation um so my question has to do
 
04:30:11.349 --> 04:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
with the property tax the local property
 
04:30:17.149 --> 04:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
tax and how it might affect uh oh the uh
 
04:30:20.670 --> 04:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
the rental price the the the rent that's
 
04:30:23.710 --> 04:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
charged in uh from town to town we know
 
04:30:25.670 --> 04:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
that the property tax varies
 
04:30:28.910 --> 04:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
enormously uh from town to town
 
04:30:33.910 --> 04:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
so um you know they price in uh in
 
04:30:37.109 --> 04:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
Claremont or uh in a number of towns
 
04:30:40.109 --> 04:30:40.119 align:start position:0%
that I could site where the taxes are
 
04:30:42.830 --> 04:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
very high
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
um is very different from the tax that's
 
04:30:48.429 --> 04:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
uh that's going going to be paid by a
 
04:30:53.870 --> 04:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
landlord in uh in uh Portsmouth or uh or
 
04:30:56.510 --> 04:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
any number of towns uh at the other end
 
04:30:58.830 --> 04:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
of the tax Spectrum so I'm just
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
wondering how that translates
 
04:31:05.870 --> 04:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
into whether You' studied this issue of
 
04:31:09.630 --> 04:31:09.640 align:start position:0%
how property taxes feed into the price
 
04:31:12.429 --> 04:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
uh that has to be charged by a
 
04:31:16.510 --> 04:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
landlord well we we've not studied it as
 
04:31:21.070 --> 04:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
part of a comprehensive study um but we
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
we do study it with every project that
 
04:31:28.389 --> 04:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
we underwrite so um when we're financing
 
04:31:31.750 --> 04:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
the development of a u multif family um
 
04:31:35.630 --> 04:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
housing project we very carefully under
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
write those projects for a period of 20
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
years and the property taxes do play an
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
important part of the development costs
 
04:31:46.510 --> 04:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
as do operations and and other factors
 
04:31:50.990 --> 04:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
um so you know it it does uh form part
 
04:31:53.790 --> 04:31:53.800 align:start position:0%
of the the proforma if you if you will
 
04:31:56.510 --> 04:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
of any development that we look at uh
 
04:31:58.750 --> 04:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
and you're right uh that the property
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
taxes do vary substantially from one
 
04:32:04.710 --> 04:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
Community to the next um but there also
 
04:32:08.109 --> 04:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh counterveiling factors so
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh you used Claremont and Portsmouth as
 
04:32:14.070 --> 04:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
as two examples well the um the taxes
 
04:32:16.070 --> 04:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
relatively speaking paid on the property
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth might be less than the
 
04:32:19.469 --> 04:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
property paid in Claremont property in
 
04:32:20.830 --> 04:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
claremont's going to cost you less at
 
04:32:22.189 --> 04:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
the outset than the property in
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth so there there are there is
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
some some balance between those two
 
04:32:28.109 --> 04:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
things uh one thing I would want to say
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
about um the property tax uh and this is
 
04:32:33.309 --> 04:32:33.319 align:start position:0%
in particular with regard to um the
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
development of new housing uh and and
 
04:32:40.830 --> 04:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
especially rental housing um it is often
 
04:32:44.469 --> 04:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
cited by opponents to uh those projects
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
at the local level before planning board
 
04:32:49.109 --> 04:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
or a zoning Board of adjustment well all
 
04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
those kids that are going to come with
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
this development we've got to pay to
 
04:32:55.750 --> 04:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
educate them um that's that is um there
 
04:32:58.710 --> 04:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
is some uh mythology associated with
 
04:33:00.389 --> 04:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
this argument because it's not really
 
04:33:03.630 --> 04:33:03.640 align:start position:0%
based in fact um we we this is something
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
that we have studied in some detail in
 
04:33:07.470 --> 04:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
fact we have a series of studies that
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
were done by Russ tibo a few years back
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh the most recent one I think was 2012
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
where we look at the the impact of new
 
04:33:21.629 --> 04:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
residential construction on uh School
 
04:33:24.869 --> 04:33:24.879 align:start position:0%
population and where we see the greatest
 
04:33:27.269 --> 04:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
impact on school population is in
 
04:33:28.990 --> 04:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
association with large single family
 
04:33:32.551 --> 04:33:32.561 align:start position:0%
homes it's really related to bedrooms
 
04:33:36.189 --> 04:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
and and the the the capacity of a home
 
04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
to accommodate kids um smaller units
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
with fewer bedrooms tend as you might
 
04:33:46.029 --> 04:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
expect to have fewer kids associated
 
04:33:48.429 --> 04:33:48.439 align:start position:0%
with them and the type of construction
 
04:33:51.470 --> 04:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
the type of of building also influences
 
04:33:53.230 --> 04:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
the number of kids that are in those
 
04:33:58.070 --> 04:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
units so a a a multiplex you know multif
 
04:34:01.390 --> 04:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
family uh uh rental project with a bunch
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
of two-bedroom units is going to have on
 
04:34:08.310 --> 04:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
average far fewer kids than your typical
 
04:34:12.150 --> 04:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
single family home uh and do the math um
 
04:34:15.029 --> 04:34:15.039 align:start position:0%
the the tax revenue you get from these
 
04:34:17.150 --> 04:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
multif family projects is pretty
 
04:34:20.029 --> 04:34:20.039 align:start position:0%
substantial and probably uh on average
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
outweighs that what you get from single
 
04:34:23.709 --> 04:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
family homes and we have done some
 
04:34:25.629 --> 04:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
additional analysis on that and that's
 
04:34:27.990 --> 04:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
available on our
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
website okay
 
04:34:33.629 --> 04:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
B before we go to the next one um you
 
04:34:35.869 --> 04:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
mentioned rust tall r we were going to
 
04:34:39.949 --> 04:34:39.959 align:start position:0%
have Russ make a presentation uh over
 
04:34:42.949 --> 04:34:42.959 align:start position:0%
the last two days but he has a medical
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
issue right now and we'll have back
 
04:34:45.359 --> 04:34:46.830 align:start position:0%
issue right now and we'll have back
later

04:34:46.830 --> 04:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
later
 
04:34:51.910 --> 04:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
EXA um you didn't really mention what's
 
04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
variation in buildable land between the
 
04:34:57.949 --> 04:34:57.959 align:start position:0%
North and the South part of the state
 
04:35:01.230 --> 04:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
because I know that where I where I'm
 
04:35:03.670 --> 04:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
from and right next to massachusett
 
04:35:06.390 --> 04:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
border if you have buildable piece of
 
04:35:09.789 --> 04:35:09.799 align:start position:0%
land that's that's going to cost
 
04:35:13.990 --> 04:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
$150,000 obviously you don't put a
 
04:35:17.709 --> 04:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
$150,000 building on it you probably to
 
04:35:20.470 --> 04:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
make it worthwhile it' be like 300,000
 
04:35:22.029 --> 04:35:22.039 align:start position:0%
so now got a
 
04:35:26.670 --> 04:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
$450,000 home so what is the range of
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
differences in buildable land cost
 
04:35:32.789 --> 04:35:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:35.189 --> 04:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
South chairman major we haven't looked
 
04:35:36.830 --> 04:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
looked at that but that that would be
 
04:35:40.189 --> 04:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
relatively uh simple exercise I think uh
 
04:35:43.510 --> 04:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
to look at um you know available land
 
04:35:46.150 --> 04:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
cost what's on the market for raw land
 
04:35:47.949 --> 04:35:47.959 align:start position:0%
we could certainly uh pull some of that
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
data and and get that back to your
 
04:35:53.949 --> 04:35:53.959 align:start position:0%
committee okay thanks happy to do that
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
04:35:59.830 --> 04:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
alme thank you I'd just like to say
 
04:36:03.029 --> 04:36:03.039 align:start position:0%
something about that from our section of
 
04:36:06.510 --> 04:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
Grafton County which is in incredbly
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
expensive uh for our area and on we are
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
actually a kind of an
 
04:36:18.349 --> 04:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
island um with difficulty of commuting
 
04:36:21.189 --> 04:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
in Winter that is prob is considerably
 
04:36:23.670 --> 04:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
worse I think than in the east and south
 
04:36:28.349 --> 04:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
of the state but on a lot of our land is
 
04:36:31.470 --> 04:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
subject to Major
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
wetness uh it's hilly it's Rocky
 
04:36:41.910 --> 04:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
on there most of our our hilly areas get
 
04:36:46.510 --> 04:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
enormous amounts of rain flowing down
 
04:36:49.709 --> 04:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
and creating floods on and the
 
04:36:51.830 --> 04:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
developers that come from outside which
 
04:36:54.029 --> 04:36:54.039 align:start position:0%
is all of our developers at this point I
 
04:36:58.390 --> 04:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
think maybe not um don't notice that
 
04:37:02.349 --> 04:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
which is one reason that that the costs
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
come in a lot higher in the end if they
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
keep up with that um it's
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
a a problem with us being our Regulators
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
being considered uh uncooperative by
 
04:37:18.029 --> 04:37:18.039 align:start position:0%
some developers they complain about it
 
04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
but uh when they build we get
 
04:37:26.949 --> 04:37:26.959 align:start position:0%
floods so on the the problem that I
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
wanted well what I wanted to ask about
 
04:37:30.990 --> 04:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
was you mentioned the housing appeals
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
board you mentioned uh
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
1632 and the companion bill in Municipal
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
and County uh you did not mention the
 
04:37:43.990 --> 04:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
five million added into the budget for
 
04:37:48.789 --> 04:37:48.799 align:start position:0%
the first time in uh 15 years 20 years
 
04:37:52.429 --> 04:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
um for the housing authority and when I
 
04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
came to you last year while we were
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
doing the
 
04:38:01.949 --> 04:38:01.959 align:start position:0%
then uh uh Griffith Alex and Alexander
 
04:38:05.869 --> 04:38:05.879 align:start position:0%
bill on and asked you whether we could
 
04:38:08.510 --> 04:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
take some of that five million to pay
 
04:38:14.189 --> 04:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
for things that were in in that bill on
 
04:38:17.029 --> 04:38:17.039 align:start position:0%
I was told that you really needed that
 
04:38:18.910 --> 04:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
five million for the stuff you've got it
 
04:38:22.189 --> 04:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
for so I presume that that's something
 
04:38:24.470 --> 04:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
you want to see I'd love to see you keep
 
04:38:28.109 --> 04:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
keeping that also but I'm worried about
 
04:38:30.429 --> 04:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
the blank check that was in the bill
 
04:38:35.709 --> 04:38:35.719 align:start position:0%
last term uh for building and and that
 
04:38:40.990 --> 04:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
we cannot C calculate the cost of and on
 
04:38:43.629 --> 04:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
how how it could get
 
04:38:43.639 --> 04:38:45.390 align:start position:0%
how how it could get
budgeted

04:38:45.390 --> 04:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
04:38:48.670 --> 04:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you for that and and yes I
 
04:38:52.429 --> 04:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
I didn't mention it in part because um
 
04:38:56.269 --> 04:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
we generally leave the advocacy for
 
04:39:00.510 --> 04:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
funding to others um we as an
 
04:39:04.150 --> 04:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
institution of the state we uh we choose
 
04:39:07.349 --> 04:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
not to go to the legislature asking for
 
04:39:11.029 --> 04:39:11.039 align:start position:0%
money when when we are asked to uh we
 
04:39:13.310 --> 04:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
happily testify on what we would do with
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
it if you the legislature chose to make
 
04:39:16.080 --> 04:39:17.070 align:start position:0%
it if you the legislature chose to make
those

04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:39:19.949 --> 04:39:19.959 align:start position:0%
Appropriations um so that said we're
 
04:39:22.709 --> 04:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
really grateful uh that the legislature
 
04:39:26.990 --> 04:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
has allocated uh $5 million annually out
 
04:39:28.949 --> 04:39:28.959 align:start position:0%
of the real estate transfer tax uh
 
04:39:31.230 --> 04:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
revenues for the affordable housing fund
 
04:39:32.750 --> 04:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
which is the state's affordable housing
 
04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
trust fund uh administered by by New
 
04:39:36.551 --> 04:39:36.561 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing on behalf of the state
 
04:39:40.750 --> 04:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
we use that for uh financing of multif
 
04:39:42.788 --> 04:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
family rental housing
 
04:39:46.430 --> 04:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
construction um and it is uh honestly
 
04:39:48.270 --> 04:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
the the most flexible source of
 
04:39:51.750 --> 04:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
financing that we have uh and to do U
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
financing of of housing
 
04:39:57.150 --> 04:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
construction um it it is it is the
 
04:40:02.070 --> 04:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
legislature's choice to do what it wants
 
04:40:04.990 --> 04:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
with the revenues that it gets from the
 
04:40:07.830 --> 04:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
sources it determines so the legislature
 
04:40:11.110 --> 04:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
has chosen to do this with $5 million a
 
04:40:15.150 --> 04:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
year um if if you chose to do something
 
04:40:17.590 --> 04:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
else with that then that means we would
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
build we would Finance less housing
 
04:40:21.708 --> 04:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
construction and that's that's the the
 
04:40:24.670 --> 04:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
bottom line it it it is a linear
 
04:40:28.470 --> 04:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
equation so U more money means more
 
04:40:31.708 --> 04:40:31.718 align:start position:0%
housing less money means less housing um
 
04:40:36.550 --> 04:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
and I you know I I I I won't address the
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
the priorities question because that's
 
04:40:40.830 --> 04:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
really a political question uh for for
 
04:40:43.350 --> 04:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
you all to address and is beyond my pay
 
04:40:43.360 --> 04:40:45.470 align:start position:0%
you all to address and is beyond my pay
grade

04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
grade
 
04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
certainly okay I just like to point out
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
on that that your financing has been key
 
04:40:57.390 --> 04:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
in getting an awful lot of housing for
 
04:41:02.430 --> 04:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
the median income on down in the
 
04:41:05.628 --> 04:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
last well forever but but there's been a
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
lot more of it this last time I
 
04:41:09.868 --> 04:41:09.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative Aly uh we
 
04:41:12.350 --> 04:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
we use the affordable housing fund to
 
04:41:14.910 --> 04:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
leverage other funds and The Leverage is
 
04:41:19.590 --> 04:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial it ranges from uh
 
04:41:22.430 --> 04:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
five times to 12 times depending upon
 
04:41:25.550 --> 04:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
the project um and and in certain
 
04:41:27.910 --> 04:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances it allows us to finance
 
04:41:30.830 --> 04:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
projects that otherwise um would not
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
happen because they can't get financing
 
04:41:34.830 --> 04:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
from other sources such as things that
 
04:41:36.868 --> 04:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
we call special needs so housing for
 
04:41:39.390 --> 04:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
04:41:42.990 --> 04:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
or housing or substance use disorder U
 
04:41:45.628 --> 04:41:45.638 align:start position:0%
people exiting um mental health
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
institutions uh there there's really not
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
much funding elsewhere uh for that kind
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
of housing uh and we use the affordable
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
housing fund for those purposes in
 
04:41:58.150 --> 04:41:58.160 align:start position:0%

04:42:00.550 --> 04:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
vanilla run-of-the-mill uh affordable
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
housing for people who need
 
04:42:03.560 --> 04:42:05.270 align:start position:0%
housing for people who need

update on our Public Health response to
 
04:43:29.708 --> 04:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and our plans for vaccine
 
04:43:32.430 --> 04:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
distribution we know that stopping a
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic requires all the tools that we
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
have available to us Granite Staters
 
04:43:39.868 --> 04:43:39.878 align:start position:0%
have been wearing masks and social
 
04:43:42.190 --> 04:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
distancing businesses have implemented
 
04:43:44.910 --> 04:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
new policies and procedures healthcare
 
04:43:46.948 --> 04:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
workers have heroically served on the
 
04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
front lines caring for patients all of
 
04:43:52.670 --> 04:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
this has helped reduce exposure but even
 
04:43:56.110 --> 04:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
these measures are not enough um a
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
public health approach to preventing
 
04:44:00.550 --> 04:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
mitigating and controlling this virus
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
requires us to use the full spectrum of
 
04:44:05.708 --> 04:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
Public Health functions in resources we
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
start with our assessment roles and
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
collecting analyzing and using data to
 
04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
make informed decisions critical to our
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
response has been the transparency of
 
04:44:17.390 --> 04:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
this data that I hope that you have all
 
04:44:20.350 --> 04:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
found on our new hampshire. goov covid
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%

access to the services they need in the
 
04:44:31.070 --> 04:44:31.080 align:start position:0%

04:44:33.670 --> 04:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
employment access to testing high
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%

04:44:43.230 --> 04:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine we um RSA 141 provides DHHS with
 
04:44:45.310 --> 04:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
the authority to prevent control and
 
04:44:47.430 --> 04:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
mitigate communicable diseases such as
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
the Corona virus because of the
 
04:44:52.390 --> 04:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary risk to health life and the
 
04:44:55.788 --> 04:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
orderly workings of business education
 
04:44:55.798 --> 04:44:56.830 align:start position:0%

04:45:33.990 --> 04:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
home in New Hampshire comparatively New
 
04:45:35.628 --> 04:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is doing better than many of
 
04:45:37.830 --> 04:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
the states Across the Nation right now
 
04:45:40.750 --> 04:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
in the average daily cases in the past
 
04:45:40.760 --> 04:45:41.708 align:start position:0%
in the average daily cases in the past
seven

04:45:41.708 --> 04:45:41.718 align:start position:0%
seven
 
04:45:44.350 --> 04:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
days but that leads us to New Hampshire
 
04:45:46.990 --> 04:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
data and you can see that we hit our
 
04:45:48.990 --> 04:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
highest daily counts back in December
 
04:45:51.990 --> 04:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
and early January our cumulative count
 
04:45:53.708 --> 04:45:53.718 align:start position:0%
of total cases since the beginning of
 
04:45:57.470 --> 04:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
the pandemic is more than 58,000 just
 
04:45:59.270 --> 04:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
almost at
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
59,000 last night we announced that we
 
04:46:05.110 --> 04:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
processed 877 new cases
 
04:46:08.310 --> 04:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
334 cases specific to January
 
04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
19th this is a decrease from the past
 
04:46:14.708 --> 04:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
seven days which is good news to give
 
04:46:16.750 --> 04:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
some context to these numbers back in
 
04:46:18.990 --> 04:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
the summer we were routinely having a
 
04:46:22.230 --> 04:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
daily case count in the 20s compared to
 
04:46:25.230 --> 04:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
our current average of around 600 some
 
04:46:29.350 --> 04:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
odd cases per day today to the relief of
 
04:46:30.750 --> 04:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
our health care System covid
 
04:46:32.270 --> 04:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations have been trending
 
04:46:34.750 --> 04:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
downward after the hospital census was
 
04:46:37.948 --> 04:46:37.958 align:start position:0%
over 300 for most of late December and
 
04:46:40.910 --> 04:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
early January we are now seeing Hospital
 
04:46:44.670 --> 04:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
census at around 250 individuals per day
 
04:46:46.030 --> 04:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
our hospitals have worked
 
04:46:48.430 --> 04:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
collaboratively to shift the burden from
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
some of the highest impacted hospitals
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
in Manchester nsha conquered but we are
 
04:46:59.868 --> 04:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:02.788 --> 04:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
yet meanwhile when we Look Backwards a
 
04:47:05.548 --> 04:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
little bit to previous to the increased
 
04:47:07.310 --> 04:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
cases we've been experiencing since
 
04:47:10.788 --> 04:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
December we can see how clusters in
 
04:47:13.948 --> 04:47:13.958 align:start position:0%
workplaces and among Gatherings really
 
04:47:16.590 --> 04:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
impact thousands of New Hampshire
 
04:47:18.670 --> 04:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
residents since the beginning of the
 
04:47:21.150 --> 04:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic more than 7,000 New Hampshire
 
04:47:23.190 --> 04:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
residents have tested positive for
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
covid-19 as a result of a workplace or
 
04:47:29.548 --> 04:47:29.558 align:start position:0%
community-based cluster the data
 
04:47:31.470 --> 04:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
snapshot that's on your screen right now
 
04:47:34.150 --> 04:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
is from September to November and it
 
04:47:36.430 --> 04:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
highlights that clusters continued in
 
04:47:38.948 --> 04:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
every sector from Community settings
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
that include churches and sports teams
 
04:47:44.190 --> 04:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
to restaurants to education and child
 
04:47:46.230 --> 04:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
care settings and Health Care settings
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
such as hospitals and long-term care you
 
04:47:51.110 --> 04:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
can see that in this time period the
 
04:47:53.350 --> 04:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
greatest number of clusters occurred in
 
04:47:56.270 --> 04:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
those Community settings but the largest
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
number of individuals with covid
 
04:48:01.510 --> 04:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
occurred among clusters in healthc care
 
04:48:04.110 --> 04:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
and in specifically in long-term care
 
04:48:04.120 --> 04:48:06.708 align:start position:0%
and in specifically in long-term care
care

04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:10.670 --> 04:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
facilities so here we are now you know
 
04:48:12.510 --> 04:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
we are in a place right now that we are
 
04:48:15.788 --> 04:48:15.798 align:start position:0%
seeing a more highly transmissible
 
04:48:18.590 --> 04:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
variant of covid it's been detected in
 
04:48:20.788 --> 04:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
over 20 States across the country
 
04:48:23.430 --> 04:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
including Massachusetts Connecticut New
 
04:48:26.510 --> 04:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
York Pennsylvania and Maryland The
 
04:48:28.548 --> 04:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
increased transmissibility of these
 
04:48:30.670 --> 04:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
variants that we've seen in the United
 
04:48:33.190 --> 04:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
States and in other places in other
 
04:48:35.548 --> 04:48:35.558 align:start position:0%
countries suggests that we need to keep
 
04:48:38.310 --> 04:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
Vigilant with compliance with mitigation
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
strategies including distancing masking
 
04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
and adherence to the safer atome
 
04:48:46.708 --> 04:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
guidelines that were developed um with
 
04:48:49.270 --> 04:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
the governor's reopening task force
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
again we are not quite out of the woods
 
04:48:57.470 --> 04:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
yet but to keep us safe for now and as
 
04:48:59.270 --> 04:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
part of our efforts to mitigate the
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
effects of covid-19 Public Health has
 
04:49:04.910 --> 04:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
participated and in and provided
 
04:49:06.990 --> 04:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
technical advice to our Governor's
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
reopening task force the public health
 
04:49:11.310 --> 04:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
role was to support the task force as
 
04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
they developed guidance for each
 
04:49:15.430 --> 04:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
industry sector that is supported by
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
both science and
 
04:49:21.470 --> 04:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
data the safer atome Universal
 
04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines have provided the required
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
steps businesses need to take in order
 
04:49:28.868 --> 04:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
to operate safely for their employees
 
04:49:31.110 --> 04:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
and the public the guidelines have
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
evolved with the science and with
 
04:49:35.670 --> 04:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
changes in the pandemic mic but focus on
 
04:49:38.030 --> 04:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
keeping potentially infectious people
 
04:49:39.788 --> 04:49:39.798 align:start position:0%
out of public workplaces through
 
04:49:41.948 --> 04:49:41.958 align:start position:0%
screening and quarantine through
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
cleaning and disinfection through
 
04:49:46.990 --> 04:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
modifications to processes and policies
 
04:49:49.510 --> 04:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
including social distancing and the use
 
04:49:52.350 --> 04:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
of masks and finally quarantine and
 
04:49:54.430 --> 04:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
isolation requirements for those with
 
04:49:57.868 --> 04:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
covid-19 or close contacts are the
 
04:50:00.150 --> 04:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
structure that all of our businesses are
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
using right now to keep
 
04:50:05.708 --> 04:50:05.718 align:start position:0%
safe the star of the show right now is
 
04:50:07.470 --> 04:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine and I think that's the thing
 
04:50:09.868 --> 04:50:09.878 align:start position:0%
most people are are interested and
 
04:50:12.990 --> 04:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
excited about we at Public Health are
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
excited that vaccine is already in the
 
04:50:18.150 --> 04:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
arms of more than 70,000 New Hampshire
 
04:50:20.030 --> 04:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
residents including our healthc care
 
04:50:22.708 --> 04:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
providers First Responders residents and
 
04:50:26.030 --> 04:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
staff of long-term care just yesterday
 
04:50:28.948 --> 04:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
uh 1,600 individuals were vaccinated at
 
04:50:31.190 --> 04:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
one of our 13 fixed sites around the
 
04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
state where we work in partnership with
 
04:50:35.110 --> 04:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
the national guard and the department of
 
04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
safety and others to make sure that we
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
have accessible vaccine in every corner
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
of the state by getting vaccinated each
 
04:50:46.270 --> 04:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
of us help end the damage to the economy
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
and prevent more illnesses and death in
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as we walk through some of
 
04:50:52.350 --> 04:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
the highlights of New Hampshire's
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
approach keep in mind the following the
 
04:50:58.510 --> 04:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
safety of covid-19 vaccines is a top
 
04:51:01.430 --> 04:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
priority the two doses of vaccine right
 
04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
now will help protect you from ID 19 and
 
04:51:08.830 --> 04:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
there is currently a limited supply of
 
04:51:11.910 --> 04:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine but Supply will increase within
 
04:51:14.510 --> 04:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
the weeks and months to come but this
 
04:51:17.230 --> 04:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
limited Supply right now is why we are
 
04:51:20.670 --> 04:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
prioritizing some groups over others for
 
04:51:22.030 --> 04:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
those first
 
04:51:25.390 --> 04:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
Doses and finally the vaccine is
 
04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
important but no one tool is going to
 
04:51:31.470 --> 04:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
stop the pandemic your best protection
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
from covid-19 continues to be a
 
04:51:36.670 --> 04:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
combination of not only getting that
 
04:51:40.110 --> 04:51:40.120 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine when it is your turn But
 
04:51:44.030 --> 04:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
continuing to wear that mask staying six
 
04:51:46.868 --> 04:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
feet away from others avoiding crowds
 
04:51:50.708 --> 04:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:53.150 --> 04:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
Often by now most of you are pretty
 
04:51:55.030 --> 04:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with new ham New Hampshire's
 
04:51:57.670 --> 04:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine allocation plan as you can
 
04:52:00.110 --> 04:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
imagine this has been a complex process
 
04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
and decisions have never been made in
 
04:52:06.070 --> 04:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
isolation our rollout philosophy has
 
04:52:10.470 --> 04:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
been to keep people from dying to impact
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
those most vulnerable to the risks of
 
04:52:16.670 --> 04:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and to keep our Health Care
 
04:52:18.830 --> 04:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
system up and running so that it is
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
ready for all of us if and when we need
 
04:52:25.470 --> 04:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
it with those goals in mind you can see
 
04:52:29.270 --> 04:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
that we prioritized those most at risk
 
04:52:31.110 --> 04:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
for the worst
 
04:52:34.750 --> 04:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes in 1B we're focusing on
 
04:52:38.150 --> 04:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
residents 65 and older and people with
 
04:52:41.350 --> 04:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
significant health risks and we focus on
 
04:52:43.628 --> 04:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
those that cannot social distance those
 
04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
in our long-term care facilities and
 
04:52:48.030 --> 04:52:48.040 align:start position:0%

the one we have right here in con ConEd
 
04:53:06.510 --> 04:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
in the parking lot of the Steeplegate
 
04:53:09.830 --> 04:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
Mall it will take a while to get through
 
04:53:12.788 --> 04:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
this population of almost a quarter of a
 
04:53:15.470 --> 04:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
million people but we anticipate that
 
04:53:18.548 --> 04:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to move into phase two in
 
04:53:21.230 --> 04:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
March and phase three throughout the
 
04:53:24.708 --> 04:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
spring later in Spring and in the summer
 
04:53:27.230 --> 04:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
The Limited vac supply of vaccines from
 
04:53:29.310 --> 04:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
the federal government means that
 
04:53:32.628 --> 04:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
appointments may be booked weeks out
 
04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
everyone in phase 1B who wants an
 
04:53:38.310 --> 04:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
appointment will get an appointment and
 
04:53:40.310 --> 04:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
if allocation should increase
 
04:53:42.070 --> 04:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
appointments will be rescheduled to
 
04:53:45.948 --> 04:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
earlier dates and times 211 is ramped up
 
04:53:47.948 --> 04:53:47.958 align:start position:0%
as a call center to help with
 
04:53:51.030 --> 04:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
registrations for the 1B population and
 
04:53:53.628 --> 04:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
those calls and that registration starts
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
this Friday we hope that most folks will
 
04:53:59.510 --> 04:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
use our website but hundreds of state
 
04:54:01.788 --> 04:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
agency staff and the National Guard will
 
04:54:04.430 --> 04:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
be ready to answer the call come Friday
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
and in the weeks ahead we will be
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
prepared to answer questions and help
 
04:54:12.110 --> 04:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
people um manage and get those
 
04:54:14.150 --> 04:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
registrations moving
 
04:54:17.190 --> 04:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
forward by this fall we hope that we
 
04:54:18.628 --> 04:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
have a significant number of New
 
04:54:20.990 --> 04:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents vaccinated and that
 
04:54:23.110 --> 04:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
Community spread will decline from the
 
04:54:25.868 --> 04:54:25.878 align:start position:0%
numbers we see today if there is
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
anything we've learned during this
 
04:54:31.150 --> 04:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's to be flexible to change
 
04:54:33.430 --> 04:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
our partners the National Guard Hospital
 
04:54:35.310 --> 04:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals long-term care providers
 
04:54:37.030 --> 04:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
community members and the residents of
 
04:54:39.270 --> 04:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have been
 
04:54:42.190 --> 04:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
extraordinary we are all eager to take
 
04:54:46.510 --> 04:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
this next step from 1 a into 1B and
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
Beyond and as we get that supply of
 
04:54:52.990 --> 04:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine we will get the doses out we
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
literally want to roll up our sleeves to
 
04:54:58.708 --> 04:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
protect our families and our communities
 
04:55:01.948 --> 04:55:01.958 align:start position:0%
and we want those most in need to be in
 
04:55:05.548 --> 04:55:05.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:07.110 --> 04:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
and if there weren't already enough
 
04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
benefits to getting vaccinated employers
 
04:55:12.270 --> 04:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
and employees should know that after you
 
04:55:14.310 --> 04:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
pass the two week Mark from your second
 
04:55:16.990 --> 04:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
dose of vaccine you no longer will need
 
04:55:19.628 --> 04:55:19.638 align:start position:0%
to quarantine if you are identified as a
 
04:55:21.868 --> 04:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
close contact or if you travel outside
 
04:55:24.948 --> 04:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
of the New England states vaccination
 
04:55:27.350 --> 04:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
provides a pathway to reduce the spread
 
04:55:30.150 --> 04:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
of disease and to get back to some sort
 
04:55:35.470 --> 04:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:38.070 --> 04:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
public I encourage you to also check out
 
04:55:39.868 --> 04:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
some of the excellent resources that are
 
04:55:42.310 --> 04:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
available on our covid-19 website
 
04:55:44.910 --> 04:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
including this FAQ for schools
 
04:55:47.270 --> 04:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
businesses employers that was developed
 
04:55:49.590 --> 04:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
by the attorney to General's office and
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions that our
 
04:55:54.270 --> 04:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
employers are wrestling with right now
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
in the cliffnotes version we are
 
04:55:58.628 --> 04:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
strongly encouraging individuals to
 
04:56:00.868 --> 04:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
protect themselves their family and
 
04:56:03.470 --> 04:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
their Community you'll see confirmation
 
04:56:06.390 --> 04:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
that the state does not intend to
 
04:56:09.070 --> 04:56:09.080 align:start position:0%
mandate these vaccines and generally
 
04:56:11.150 --> 04:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
does not recommend that these vaccines
 
04:56:15.030 --> 04:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
be mandated for students employees or
 
04:56:17.390 --> 04:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
customers there's a couple reasons for
 
04:56:19.868 --> 04:56:19.878 align:start position:0%
that first of all there may be legal
 
04:56:21.750 --> 04:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
complexity surrounding mandates for
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
vaccines approved through an eua which
 
04:56:26.590 --> 04:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
is an emergency use authorization
 
04:56:27.948 --> 04:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
through the
 
04:56:30.470 --> 04:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
FDA there's also a question of equity
 
04:56:33.310 --> 04:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
and fairness when neither of the any of
 
04:56:35.548 --> 04:56:35.558 align:start position:0%
vaccines will be available to the entire
 
04:56:38.430 --> 04:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
population at the same time we simply do
 
04:56:41.628 --> 04:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
not have enough vaccine right now for
 
04:56:43.990 --> 04:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
everyone and while it's generally not
 
04:56:46.750 --> 04:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
recommended at this time however a
 
04:56:49.830 --> 04:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
business could choose to require a
 
04:56:52.270 --> 04:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine this is not unlike healthc care
 
04:56:54.270 --> 04:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
providers who require their employees to
 
04:56:56.990 --> 04:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
have a flu vaccine if a business is
 
04:56:59.270 --> 04:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
considering this approach it must be
 
04:57:01.510 --> 04:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory in nature and
 
04:57:03.548 --> 04:57:03.558 align:start position:0%
employers may be required to make
 
04:57:06.150 --> 04:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
accommodations for employees under
 
04:57:09.868 --> 04:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
federal laws such as the Ada or the
 
04:57:12.310 --> 04:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
EOC if businesses are thinking about
 
04:57:14.788 --> 04:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
going down this path they should do so
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
in consultation with their legal counsel
 
04:57:20.990 --> 04:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
an approach we can all take is to remove
 
04:57:24.868 --> 04:57:24.878 align:start position:0%
barriers for employees to access vaccine
 
04:57:26.430 --> 04:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
that includes ensuring that people have
 
04:57:29.708 --> 04:57:29.718 align:start position:0%
time of work to get the vaccine and that
 
04:57:30.910 --> 04:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
people are
 
04:57:33.670 --> 04:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
encouraged at the end of the day the
 
04:57:36.430 --> 04:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine will protect our families save
 
04:57:39.788 --> 04:57:39.798 align:start position:0%
lives and it will offer that pathway to
 
04:57:41.230 --> 04:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
return to the Gatherings that are
 
04:57:44.910 --> 04:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
important to us for our physical mental
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:50.470 --> 04:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
health so what's
 
04:57:54.670 --> 04:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
next phase B registration starts Friday
 
04:57:59.470 --> 04:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
phase 1B vaccinations start next week we
 
04:58:02.510 --> 04:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
are asking the public to take a look at
 
04:58:06.190 --> 04:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
the vaccine website the vaccine.
 
04:58:10.430 --> 04:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
nh.gov webbsite to see when is their
 
04:58:12.750 --> 04:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
turn and they can go through a little
 
04:58:14.350 --> 04:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
process there to click through some
 
04:58:16.830 --> 04:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
buttons and determine what phase that
 
04:58:20.350 --> 04:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
they likely belong in we know that phase
 
04:58:24.070 --> 04:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
1B is a heavy lift there is between
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
250,000 and 300,000 New Hampshire
 
04:58:29.590 --> 04:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
residents in this group and we hope to
 
04:58:31.990 --> 04:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to offer them
 
04:58:35.628 --> 04:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine as we have it
 
04:58:39.750 --> 04:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
available we also encourage all of our
 
04:58:41.350 --> 04:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh residents of New Hampshire to call
 
04:58:44.868 --> 04:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
211 as I noted earlier we have hundreds
 
04:58:47.548 --> 04:58:47.558 align:start position:0%
of state agency staff ready to man the
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
phones working on it right now we have
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
National Guard folks helping us because
 
04:58:54.150 --> 04:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
we know the interest is so great at this
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
moment so feel free to use tom11 now and
 
04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
to use 211 as we start registration at
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
the end of this week and the beginning
 
04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
of next
 
04:59:08.230 --> 04:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
week and finally we ask you all to just
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
stay informed and I know that this
 
04:59:12.990 --> 04:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
committee as much as any has been
 
04:59:15.868 --> 04:59:15.878 align:start position:0%
watching closely through our Governor's
 
04:59:17.548 --> 04:59:17.558 align:start position:0%
press conferences and through the
 
04:59:21.430 --> 04:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
updates with Dr Chan and Dr Daly and we
 
04:59:23.510 --> 04:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
have tried to be as transparent as
 
04:59:26.190 --> 04:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
possible on our website to provide all
 
04:59:29.070 --> 04:59:29.080 align:start position:0%
the information that folks need as we
 
04:59:32.270 --> 04:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
know it so I will stop my share right
 
04:59:34.990 --> 04:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
now and I will turn back on my camera
 
04:59:37.470 --> 04:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
04:59:39.430 --> 04:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
that you may
 
04:59:42.670 --> 04:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
have let me ask the first question
 
04:59:45.548 --> 04:59:45.558 align:start position:0%
Patricia is it possible for you to go
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
back I think to your third Slide the one
 
04:59:53.030 --> 04:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
which shows the 60 to 69 age group 70 to
 
04:59:54.990 --> 04:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
79 80
 
04:59:57.990 --> 04:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
plus okay let me pull that up right
 
05:00:02.110 --> 05:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
there and I think you were which you
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
were for
 
05:00:06.590 --> 05:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
shows the one with the number of deaths
 
05:00:09.548 --> 05:00:09.558 align:start position:0%
per age group yes yes I will pull that
 
05:00:13.708 --> 05:00:13.718 align:start position:0%
up for right now and here we go whoops
 
05:00:16.990 --> 05:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
maybe not we'll go backwards this way I
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
think all of us are mastering zoom in
 
05:00:21.310 --> 05:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
new ways these days here we go is that
 
05:00:23.350 --> 05:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
the slide that you were interested in
 
05:00:26.350 --> 05:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you it shows the number of
 
05:00:30.510 --> 05:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
deaths uh the 60 to 69 age group is is
 
05:00:33.830 --> 05:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
so much and then the 70 to 79 is
 
05:00:37.190 --> 05:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
probably about triple that and the 80
 
05:00:41.350 --> 05:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
plus is much much greater than that and
 
05:00:44.708 --> 05:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
at one time 1B group was going to be for
 
05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
the vaccination was going to be 75 and
 
05:00:51.350 --> 05:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
and above but it was just changed
 
05:00:55.830 --> 05:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
recently to 65 and above and where it
 
05:00:59.150 --> 05:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
goes to 65 and above
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's going to be very difficult for
 
05:01:05.070 --> 05:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
those that are in in their 80s or in the
 
05:01:09.548 --> 05:01:09.558 align:start position:0%
high 70s to comp compete with the ones
 
05:01:10.590 --> 05:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:01:15.270 --> 05:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
65 a lot a very last group to get it and
 
05:01:18.190 --> 05:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
they may end up being because they're in
 
05:01:20.788 --> 05:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
this group may end up getting it at the
 
05:01:22.948 --> 05:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
end of the group are you doing any
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
prioritizing within group 1B so we are
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
trying to do that and and um and first
 
05:01:31.070 --> 05:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
of all thank you for that question and
 
05:01:33.830 --> 05:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
you're very appropriate observation of
 
05:01:35.750 --> 05:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
the data I think there's a couple of
 
05:01:38.070 --> 05:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
ways that we've addressed this one is
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
working with our Pharmacy Partners um to
 
05:01:45.270 --> 05:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have uh vaccine at all of
 
05:01:47.590 --> 05:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
our our long-term care facilities and
 
05:01:50.030 --> 05:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
that includes both our nursing homes and
 
05:01:52.948 --> 05:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities and we know
 
05:01:55.310 --> 05:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
that they were our you know among our
 
05:01:57.948 --> 05:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
number one population that was 1A it was
 
05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
them and the healthc care providers and
 
05:02:02.430 --> 05:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
our First Responders and we are thankful
 
05:02:04.788 --> 05:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
that we have gotten at least first doses
 
05:02:08.110 --> 05:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
out to over 126 of those facilities in
 
05:02:10.310 --> 05:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
the state and all of them will have had
 
05:02:13.910 --> 05:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
first doses by the end of January CVS
 
05:02:16.110 --> 05:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
and Walgreens have been great Partners
 
05:02:18.430 --> 05:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
CVS is taking care of about
 
05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
75% of uh those long-term care
 
05:02:22.750 --> 05:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
facilities and Walgreens is taking care
 
05:02:25.750 --> 05:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
of another 25% but we think that that's
 
05:02:28.750 --> 05:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
that population um certainly generally
 
05:02:31.868 --> 05:02:31.878 align:start position:0%
um 75 and older so 70 and older and 80
 
05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
plus um that are most at risk and really
 
05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
as the data show most at risk of dying
 
05:02:37.840 --> 05:02:39.110 align:start position:0%
as the data show most at risk of dying
from

05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:02:41.788 --> 05:02:41.798 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um I think the other point of
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
your question that we certainly have a
 
05:02:46.590 --> 05:02:46.600 align:start position:0%
large number of folks that are uh 70
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
plus 75 plus that are not living in a
 
05:02:51.788 --> 05:02:51.798 align:start position:0%
long-term care facility and as you noted
 
05:02:53.868 --> 05:02:53.878 align:start position:0%
they're almost in competition now with
 
05:02:57.270 --> 05:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
that 65 and older group um for getting
 
05:03:00.788 --> 05:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
signed up um we are hoping to try and
 
05:03:02.948 --> 05:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
make sure that that we have vacc
 
05:03:06.070 --> 05:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
available to everybody who signs up um
 
05:03:08.190 --> 05:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
we know that there is increased risk
 
05:03:11.910 --> 05:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
from 65 plus um we know that um just a
 
05:03:16.030 --> 05:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
week or so ago the federal government um
 
05:03:19.150 --> 05:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
secretary AAR had recommended to all
 
05:03:22.990 --> 05:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
states that we focus on that 65 plus
 
05:03:25.430 --> 05:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
population um the other group that is
 
05:03:27.708 --> 05:03:27.718 align:start position:0%
included in 1B is also the medically
 
05:03:29.708 --> 05:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
complex those who are who potentially
 
05:03:33.150 --> 05:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
are under 65 but had to have multiple um
 
05:03:35.270 --> 05:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
medical conditions they are also
 
05:03:36.990 --> 05:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized and we're working closely
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
with Healthcare Providers to um simplify
 
05:03:42.670 --> 05:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
the way that we can attest to that so
 
05:03:44.910 --> 05:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
the short answer to your question is
 
05:03:46.830 --> 05:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
that there will be signups starting on
 
05:03:50.190 --> 05:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
Friday um we have prioritizations within
 
05:03:53.548 --> 05:03:53.558 align:start position:0%
the prioritized group of 65 plus um and
 
05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
we are hoping to get as many vaccines
 
05:03:58.708 --> 05:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
into the arms as many people in this
 
05:04:01.788 --> 05:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
population as possible and as the supply
 
05:04:06.190 --> 05:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
allows let me ask this followup is that
 
05:04:09.868 --> 05:04:09.878 align:start position:0%
I I know of some people that are over 85
 
05:04:12.510 --> 05:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
with at least a couple of these
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
conditions there uh when they sign up
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
will they be
 
05:04:22.070 --> 05:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
prioritized if if if maybe maybe they
 
05:04:24.750 --> 05:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
try to go on first thing Friday but they
 
05:04:26.868 --> 05:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
can't get through until Friday night and
 
05:04:29.470 --> 05:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
by yeah by then there was thousands of
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
them that already got ahead of
 
05:04:35.190 --> 05:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
them yeah get prioritized we are we're
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
asking folks if they have questions and
 
05:04:40.030 --> 05:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
they need help and they believe that
 
05:04:41.628 --> 05:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
they should be at the the top of the
 
05:04:45.628 --> 05:04:45.638 align:start position:0%
line again um we want you to call 211
 
05:04:47.830 --> 05:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
they will help folks get through that
 
05:04:50.510 --> 05:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
process we want to be able to be there
 
05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
available to them um so that they can
 
05:04:55.510 --> 05:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
get registered and then after they're
 
05:04:57.788 --> 05:04:57.798 align:start position:0%
registered those um appointments get
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
made uh as well so the advice is use 211
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
rather than the going online you can use
 
05:05:08.990 --> 05:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
you can use both but if you want to talk
 
05:05:10.830 --> 05:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
to a person who will walk you through
 
05:05:13.510 --> 05:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
that certainly you are free to call 211
 
05:05:20.470 --> 05:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:25.270 --> 05:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
second bring this up okay representative
 
05:05:27.510 --> 05:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
Bry has a
 
05:05:29.948 --> 05:05:29.958 align:start position:0%
question thank you good presentation
 
05:05:32.670 --> 05:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um where Ways and Means as
 
05:05:35.030 --> 05:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know we're charged with doing
 
05:05:36.750 --> 05:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates that's going to that
 
05:05:39.948 --> 05:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
are going to be based a lot on how
 
05:05:43.788 --> 05:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
quickly things are go back to normal and
 
05:05:45.470 --> 05:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
you know as we know we have to project
 
05:05:49.590 --> 05:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
revenues for July 21st July of 2021 to
 
05:05:53.350 --> 05:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
June of 22 July of 22 to June of
 
05:05:56.910 --> 05:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
23 uh by the middle of February so part
 
05:05:58.150 --> 05:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
of the big question that we're going to
 
05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
keep on coming back to is well when are
 
05:06:02.910 --> 05:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
we going to hit her
 
05:06:04.948 --> 05:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
immunity now I I listened to the
 
05:06:07.948 --> 05:06:07.958 align:start position:0%
governor last week uh last Thursday and
 
05:06:09.830 --> 05:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
he said New Hampshire was getting about
 
05:06:14.350 --> 05:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
177,000 doses a week at currently when I
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
when I hear one B is 300,000 people is
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
that 600,000 doses that equates to to me
 
05:06:24.628 --> 05:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
I did the math that'll take eight eight
 
05:06:27.070 --> 05:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
over eight months to do about eight
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
months to do uh assuming that the number
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
of doses that we are given doesn't an
 
05:06:35.948 --> 05:06:35.958 align:start position:0%
increase I guess question one is what's
 
05:06:37.910 --> 05:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
the chances of us getting more doses As
 
05:06:39.030 --> 05:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
Time Marches
 
05:06:42.030 --> 05:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
on uh because the more doses equals the
 
05:06:45.310 --> 05:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
the quicker more people will uh be
 
05:06:49.470 --> 05:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
inoculated and and the number of uh you
 
05:06:51.110 --> 05:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
know that's the more likely that the
 
05:06:52.868 --> 05:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
state of emergency will end and th
 
05:06:55.390 --> 05:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
helping revenues and the other question
 
05:06:59.788 --> 05:06:59.798 align:start position:0%
I have is about this new strain that to
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
me that could be another fly in the
 
05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
ointment in our thing is on ways means
 
05:07:07.310 --> 05:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh do we know if the current vaccines
 
05:07:10.310 --> 05:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
are effective on this new strain that's
 
05:07:10.320 --> 05:07:11.430 align:start position:0%
are effective on this new strain that's
great

05:07:11.430 --> 05:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
great
 
05:07:13.270 --> 05:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you
 
05:07:14.868 --> 05:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
representative abrami you're you're
 
05:07:17.390 --> 05:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
asking great questions around the supply
 
05:07:19.708 --> 05:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
I'll start with that um you're correct
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
we are receiving about 18,000 doses a
 
05:07:24.150 --> 05:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
week it is not enough to do all the
 
05:07:26.670 --> 05:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
folks that we want to get vaccin vaccine
 
05:07:28.990 --> 05:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
into the good news however is that we
 
05:07:31.230 --> 05:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
expect that to increase we expect that
 
05:07:34.350 --> 05:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
there are two other uh manufacturers
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
that are right in the wings that should
 
05:07:39.350 --> 05:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
be coming up soon with supplies of new
 
05:07:41.548 --> 05:07:41.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine as well one of which is a one
 
05:07:44.110 --> 05:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
dose not a two dose so that's great news
 
05:07:45.910 --> 05:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
most of us would love to have one one
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
shot in the arm instead of two shots in
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
the arm so we are um going to be
 
05:07:53.708 --> 05:07:53.718 align:start position:0%
registering people out um we will be
 
05:07:55.910 --> 05:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
using every single dose that is
 
05:07:59.030 --> 05:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
available to us and we are hopeful that
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
the supply it will increase over the
 
05:08:03.788 --> 05:08:03.798 align:start position:0%
next few weeks and certainly months
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
ahead of us as new manufacturers come on
 
05:08:08.590 --> 05:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
board and receive their emergency use
 
05:08:11.910 --> 05:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
authorization as well um we are anxious
 
05:08:14.270 --> 05:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
to work with a a new Administration as
 
05:08:18.030 --> 05:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
of today um to ensure that states get
 
05:08:21.270 --> 05:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
Equitable supply of vaccine so that we
 
05:08:23.390 --> 05:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
can reach all the people that we need to
 
05:08:25.150 --> 05:08:25.160 align:start position:0%
reach I think we're all in agreement
 
05:08:28.430 --> 05:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
that this is the this is our pathway out
 
05:08:30.750 --> 05:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
um for both healthy people and healthy
 
05:08:34.470 --> 05:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
main streets your second question about
 
05:08:37.030 --> 05:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
the variant um certainly all of the
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
scientists are keeping a very um strong
 
05:08:41.190 --> 05:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
look at this right now and watching the
 
05:08:44.110 --> 05:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
data as I mentioned it's throughout this
 
05:08:45.510 --> 05:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
the country right now it has been
 
05:08:47.150 --> 05:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
identified in Massachusetts it's been
 
05:08:49.110 --> 05:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
identified in New York we have not
 
05:08:51.708 --> 05:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
identified one of the variants in New
 
05:08:55.430 --> 05:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yet um we have the capacity to
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
do some of the genome sequencing to do
 
05:09:00.670 --> 05:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
that work so we're getting ready um and
 
05:09:03.788 --> 05:09:03.798 align:start position:0%
we have sent um particular samples to be
 
05:09:06.270 --> 05:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
sequenced that have not um been
 
05:09:08.590 --> 05:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
identified as being the variant so we
 
05:09:11.310 --> 05:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
are certainly concerned um the science
 
05:09:13.830 --> 05:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
as of today and the data suggest right
 
05:09:16.788 --> 05:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
now that the vaccine will be effective
 
05:09:19.310 --> 05:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
against the new variant the main concern
 
05:09:21.548 --> 05:09:21.558 align:start position:0%
with the variants are that it appears
 
05:09:24.150 --> 05:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
that they are more easily transmissible
 
05:09:26.548 --> 05:09:26.558 align:start position:0%
so again we are all anxious to get as
 
05:09:28.830 --> 05:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
many vaccines out into the community as
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
possible to limit that transmissibility
 
05:09:34.788 --> 05:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
it's also the other reason why all of us
 
05:09:36.948 --> 05:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
can't give up on that M you know I'll
 
05:09:39.030 --> 05:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
sound like a broken record like Dr Chan
 
05:09:40.750 --> 05:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like a broken record like the
 
05:09:42.788 --> 05:09:42.798 align:start position:0%
governor sounds like a broken record we
 
05:09:45.230 --> 05:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
can't give up yet on the masking of our
 
05:09:47.868 --> 05:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
social distancing and staying away from
 
05:09:50.788 --> 05:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
large crowds of people quite yet you
 
05:09:53.150 --> 05:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
know we see the light at the end um but
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
we got to get there thank you Norm I
 
05:09:57.708 --> 05:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
have one more question but I'll let
 
05:09:59.310 --> 05:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
others go first and if there's time I'll
 
05:10:01.430 --> 05:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'll ask it thank you thank you uh
 
05:10:01.440 --> 05:10:03.030 align:start position:0%
I'll ask it thank you thank you uh
Patricia

05:10:03.030 --> 05:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
Patricia
 
05:10:03.040 --> 05:10:04.548 align:start position:0%
Patricia
represent

05:10:04.548 --> 05:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:10:07.350 --> 05:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
elmy thank you I had a bunch of
 
05:10:11.350 --> 05:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
questions too but on the first thing is
 
05:10:14.190 --> 05:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
there as far as I've heard I've heard a
 
05:10:16.548 --> 05:10:16.558 align:start position:0%
fair amount about this sorry about that
 
05:10:21.390 --> 05:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
phone call on the on there is no
 
05:10:24.590 --> 05:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
evidence yet that the people who are
 
05:10:28.350 --> 05:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated are not cannot be carriers of
 
05:10:32.590 --> 05:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
covid so I do not understand how we can
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
tell people not to
 
05:10:39.270 --> 05:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
quarantine once they've been vaccinated
 
05:10:42.270 --> 05:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
completely on which is really going to
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
delay things for for our economy and the
 
05:10:50.390 --> 05:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
other one is just following up on
 
05:10:54.628 --> 05:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
representative major our chair on there
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen anything in the
 
05:10:59.590 --> 05:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
advertising about this that would
 
05:11:02.990 --> 05:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
indicate that you should call 211 if
 
05:11:06.030 --> 05:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
you're over 75 or you've got a number of
 
05:11:11.830 --> 05:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
The Chronic conditions and on I did use
 
05:11:17.670 --> 05:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
your check and I'm over 65 I will be
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
over 75 two days before I was going to
 
05:11:22.590 --> 05:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
be eligible
 
05:11:27.788 --> 05:11:27.798 align:start position:0%
before um oh 65 to 75 is a lot healthier
 
05:11:32.628 --> 05:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
than 75 on up uh and
 
05:11:32.638 --> 05:11:34.708 align:start position:0%
than 75 on up uh and
um

05:11:34.708 --> 05:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:38.750 --> 05:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
the the people in our in that age group
 
05:11:41.590 --> 05:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
those age groups who are at home which
 
05:11:45.548 --> 05:11:45.558 align:start position:0%
is a lot of people uh really need to be
 
05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
told that you should not use the
 
05:11:51.628 --> 05:11:51.638 align:start position:0%
internet which I think is probably going
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
to crash the first few days uh but they
 
05:11:58.830 --> 05:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
should go straight to 211 and try to get
 
05:12:00.310 --> 05:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
through that
 
05:12:04.470 --> 05:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
system but that or if if I mean all it
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
asked me was are you over 65 and then it
 
05:12:10.350 --> 05:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
said great to come in uh there really
 
05:12:12.548 --> 05:12:12.558 align:start position:0%
should have been are you over 65 okay
 
05:12:15.910 --> 05:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
you over 75 over 75 we're going to give
 
05:12:18.708 --> 05:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
you a appointment
 
05:12:21.788 --> 05:12:21.798 align:start position:0%
sooner or with major health
 
05:12:24.310 --> 05:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
conditions thank you so thank you
 
05:12:25.628 --> 05:12:25.638 align:start position:0%
representative Aly I think you're
 
05:12:28.270 --> 05:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
expressing uh a number of the concerns
 
05:12:30.310 --> 05:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
that um certainly the public has right
 
05:12:32.990 --> 05:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
now and I just want to be clear here um
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
your uh my recommendation to call 211 is
 
05:12:38.350 --> 05:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
simply so that you can talk through the
 
05:12:40.548 --> 05:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
process with someone rather than going
 
05:12:43.150 --> 05:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
through the uh registration process
 
05:12:45.430 --> 05:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
online and I know for many people that
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
is easier um for to be able to walk
 
05:12:50.350 --> 05:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
through with another human next to you
 
05:12:52.110 --> 05:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh or on the phone with you as you do
 
05:12:55.470 --> 05:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
that work we understand that you know um
 
05:12:59.510 --> 05:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
that folks over 75 may be at added risk
 
05:13:01.270 --> 05:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
um we also know that there are risks
 
05:13:03.788 --> 05:13:03.798 align:start position:0%
associated even among that 65 and older
 
05:13:06.750 --> 05:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
group who may still be in the workforce
 
05:13:09.788 --> 05:13:09.798 align:start position:0%
um and so it is difficult to balance all
 
05:13:12.750 --> 05:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
of those different risks together um but
 
05:13:15.030 --> 05:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
my recommendation is to call 211 if you
 
05:13:16.750 --> 05:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
want to talk through that with someone
 
05:13:19.948 --> 05:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
on the phone um the website um you know
 
05:13:24.390 --> 05:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
we are we are uh very um we are putting
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
together everything we possibly can
 
05:13:28.070 --> 05:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
right now all of the supports all of our
 
05:13:29.708 --> 05:13:29.718 align:start position:0%
efforts are in making sure that both the
 
05:13:32.628 --> 05:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
phone system and the website system will
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
be ready and not crash um come Friday
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
and through the weekend uh we are
 
05:13:39.110 --> 05:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
dedicating a tremendous amount of
 
05:13:41.150 --> 05:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
resources across state government to do
 
05:13:43.350 --> 05:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
that right now so that is the piece that
 
05:13:44.990 --> 05:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
we all have our not only have our
 
05:13:46.670 --> 05:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
fingers crossed but we're putting real
 
05:13:49.788 --> 05:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
effort into um making sure that we have
 
05:13:52.510 --> 05:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
that ready again to your earlier qu your
 
05:13:54.510 --> 05:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
first question around vacc after getting
 
05:13:58.350 --> 05:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated there is some small
 
05:14:00.910 --> 05:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
indication um and again we need more
 
05:14:03.270 --> 05:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
data and more time with more people who
 
05:14:05.350 --> 05:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
are vaccinated to see how this really
 
05:14:07.868 --> 05:14:07.878 align:start position:0%
plays out in real life um but there's
 
05:14:10.830 --> 05:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
some small scientific possibility that
 
05:14:12.830 --> 05:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
um a person who was vaccinated could
 
05:14:17.948 --> 05:14:17.958 align:start position:0%
still H carry that um the uh Co Corona
 
05:14:20.070 --> 05:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
virus um in their mouth and their
 
05:14:22.150 --> 05:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
respiratory droplets which is why we're
 
05:14:24.590 --> 05:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
asking everyone to continue to wear
 
05:14:27.548 --> 05:14:27.558 align:start position:0%
their masks even if they are vaccinated
 
05:14:30.390 --> 05:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
but it was a decision of Dr Chan and our
 
05:14:32.230 --> 05:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
governor's office that
 
05:14:35.350 --> 05:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
um because the risks are s so much fewer
 
05:14:38.670 --> 05:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
so low much lower um that we would still
 
05:14:40.548 --> 05:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
allow people that have had those two
 
05:14:43.270 --> 05:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
doses of vaccine and then two weeks out
 
05:14:46.150 --> 05:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to travel without quarantine
 
05:14:48.868 --> 05:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
or to be able to um not quarantine if
 
05:14:51.990 --> 05:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
they were a close contact we uh we very
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
much encourage all businesses in
 
05:14:56.948 --> 05:14:56.958 align:start position:0%
particular to um make their own policies
 
05:14:59.230 --> 05:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
that are perhaps more protective um than
 
05:15:02.190 --> 05:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
our policies and where staff can work
 
05:15:04.708 --> 05:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
remotely we're truly you know as we're
 
05:15:07.150 --> 05:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
all doing right now calling in from our
 
05:15:09.070 --> 05:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
homes or our offices where we're
 
05:15:11.390 --> 05:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
separate we want to continue doing those
 
05:15:13.150 --> 05:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
practices because of course that is the
 
05:15:13.160 --> 05:15:13.990 align:start position:0%
practices because of course that is the
most

05:15:13.990 --> 05:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
most
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
protective thank you but now that we are
 
05:15:22.350 --> 05:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
uh we have a 65y old level uh the only
 
05:15:25.030 --> 05:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
way that you can get an earlier
 
05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
appointment if you are severely uh
 
05:15:32.548 --> 05:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
impacted by covid if you catch it is to
 
05:15:33.708 --> 05:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
call up
 
05:15:36.430 --> 05:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
211 um I I would not I'm not going to
 
05:15:38.948 --> 05:15:38.958 align:start position:0%
promise that folks can get an earlier
 
05:15:41.110 --> 05:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
appointment if they call 211 all I'm
 
05:15:42.628 --> 05:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that someone will walk
 
05:15:45.150 --> 05:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
them through the process while they're
 
05:15:47.910 --> 05:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
there um again it is complex we are
 
05:15:50.190 --> 05:15:50.200 align:start position:0%
expecting thousands of people to be
 
05:15:52.510 --> 05:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
calling us early on this is another
 
05:15:54.030 --> 05:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
place where you may also want to have a
 
05:15:55.270 --> 05:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
conversation with your healthc care
 
05:15:59.628 --> 05:15:59.638 align:start position:0%
provider so um there are at some point
 
05:16:01.868 --> 05:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
um healthc care providers will also have
 
05:16:03.750 --> 05:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
access to vaccine that they can do
 
05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
within their offices um we are working
 
05:16:08.070 --> 05:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
on the distribution of that right now I
 
05:16:10.030 --> 05:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact numbers of how much
 
05:16:12.150 --> 05:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
will be distributed to hospitals and
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
healthc care providers Primary Care
 
05:16:16.390 --> 05:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
Providers at in addition to our fixed
 
05:16:19.390 --> 05:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
sites so I encourage anyone who has
 
05:16:21.628 --> 05:16:21.638 align:start position:0%
significant questions about their own
 
05:16:24.390 --> 05:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
health um and if the vaccine is right
 
05:16:27.070 --> 05:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
for them um and how they should access
 
05:16:30.070 --> 05:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
that um to eventually call their healthc
 
05:16:31.788 --> 05:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
care provider I know that the health all
 
05:16:33.548 --> 05:16:33.558 align:start position:0%
of our Healthcare Providers right now
 
05:16:35.230 --> 05:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
their phones are ringing off the hook as
 
05:16:37.390 --> 05:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
well and they're trying to provide as
 
05:16:40.390 --> 05:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
much information that they know given at
 
05:16:43.510 --> 05:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
at the at the time that they know it um
 
05:16:45.150 --> 05:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
the information has been we've gone
 
05:16:48.350 --> 05:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
quick um we've provided um something
 
05:16:50.350 --> 05:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
called Health alert networks to all our
 
05:16:52.150 --> 05:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
providers so that they should have the
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
basic level of information and what the
 
05:16:56.510 --> 05:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
plan is we've been doing weekly calls
 
05:16:58.868 --> 05:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
with our hospitals um since the
 
05:17:00.628 --> 05:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
beginning of the pandemic so that we
 
05:17:03.390 --> 05:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
have good communic unication but things
 
05:17:07.270 --> 05:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
change quickly um and um we we want
 
05:17:09.830 --> 05:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
folks to make sure that they know that
 
05:17:11.788 --> 05:17:11.798 align:start position:0%
um you know the first day to sign up is
 
05:17:15.190 --> 05:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
on Friday um and we want to make sure
 
05:17:17.670 --> 05:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
everyone has an opportunity to sign up
 
05:17:21.430 --> 05:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:30.400 --> 05:17:38.868 align:start position:0%
 
Ames

05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:42.190 --> 05:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:45.510 --> 05:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
unmute sorry about that I gotta start
 
05:17:49.230 --> 05:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
over again thank you uh and uh my
 
05:17:53.110 --> 05:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
question is twofold one is uh um even
 
05:17:56.750 --> 05:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
after listening to you uh speak about
 
05:18:00.548 --> 05:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
the priorities and the opening up of 1B
 
05:18:03.830 --> 05:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
in a couple of I guess very soon uh for
 
05:18:06.910 --> 05:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
registration it's not clear to me what
 
05:18:09.430 --> 05:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
the rules of the game are going to be is
 
05:18:12.070 --> 05:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
it going to be a first come first serve
 
05:18:13.830 --> 05:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
is there some other protocol that's
 
05:18:16.830 --> 05:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
going to be in place where you live uh
 
05:18:18.750 --> 05:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
what are the what are the variables that
 
05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
are going to go into determining when
 
05:18:27.390 --> 05:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
somebody um on who calls in is likely uh
 
05:18:29.708 --> 05:18:29.718 align:start position:0%
to get uh
 
05:18:33.548 --> 05:18:33.558 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um and the second
 
05:18:33.558 --> 05:18:35.230 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um and the second
question

05:18:35.230 --> 05:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
um is uh is one that flows from a
 
05:18:41.310 --> 05:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
constituents letter that I received just
 
05:18:44.708 --> 05:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
yesterday a married couple who are in
 
05:18:49.470 --> 05:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
their U 6566 67 year old
 
05:18:53.270 --> 05:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
bracket um they've served as teachers
 
05:18:53.280 --> 05:18:54.030 align:start position:0%
bracket um they've served as teachers
they're

05:18:54.030 --> 05:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:18:58.548 --> 05:18:58.558 align:start position:0%
healthy um they are I'd say very upset
 
05:19:02.910 --> 05:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
that they've been moved into a uh the
 
05:19:06.830 --> 05:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
next Priority One B uh while
 
05:19:10.948 --> 05:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
teachers and child care workers or
 
05:19:15.750 --> 05:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
teachers uh remain in priority too in
 
05:19:20.310 --> 05:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
effect pushing back teachers to a uh a
 
05:19:23.670 --> 05:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
later time and uh they point out that
 
05:19:26.590 --> 05:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
keeping our schools open is uh certainly
 
05:19:28.910 --> 05:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
for all of us uh one of the top
 
05:19:31.910 --> 05:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
priorities in this state uh getting them
 
05:19:34.030 --> 05:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
open keeping them open whatever it is in
 
05:19:38.030 --> 05:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
your local community um and so pushing
 
05:19:43.070 --> 05:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
back teachers in this way um is uh is
 
05:19:44.830 --> 05:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
very problematic from their point of
 
05:19:47.230 --> 05:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
view and my question there is whether
 
05:19:50.110 --> 05:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
this question of prioritizing of uh
 
05:19:54.350 --> 05:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
defining the groups uh in a senseful way
 
05:19:57.150 --> 05:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
is is open and still being worked on
 
05:19:58.948 --> 05:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
within the circles that you're working
 
05:20:01.230 --> 05:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
in uh and I would certainly put in a
 
05:20:04.548 --> 05:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
pitch for the teachers myself um so
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's basically it I think ultimately
 
05:20:08.470 --> 05:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
supply uh of vaccination is going to uh
 
05:20:15.470 --> 05:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
determine a great deal of what uh can be
 
05:20:17.230 --> 05:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
done and I know you've mentioned that
 
05:20:20.310 --> 05:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
several times I wish I had a better
 
05:20:23.270 --> 05:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of how we go from 177,000
 
05:20:26.270 --> 05:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
or 18,000 doses
 
05:20:30.430 --> 05:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
today um to whatever a week from now or
 
05:20:32.470 --> 05:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
two weeks from now again what are the
 
05:20:34.190 --> 05:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
variables what's the information that
 
05:20:37.548 --> 05:20:37.558 align:start position:0%
you're on top of receiving or that you
 
05:20:40.030 --> 05:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
hope to receive soon that relates to
 
05:20:42.590 --> 05:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
that so I've I've uh there's a lot in
 
05:20:46.910 --> 05:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
there I'm sorry but uh very yeah thank
 
05:20:48.350 --> 05:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
you and I'll I'll try and pick through
 
05:20:50.470 --> 05:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
some of those um the questions that
 
05:20:51.910 --> 05:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
you're asking there I'll start with
 
05:20:54.670 --> 05:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
Supply um again we are hopeful that new
 
05:20:57.070 --> 05:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are coming on board we are
 
05:20:59.310 --> 05:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
also hopeful that the there will be an
 
05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
increase in both the fiser and the Mna
 
05:21:04.948 --> 05:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine that we have right now we are um
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
the federal government is sends the
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
allocations to the states so we are
 
05:21:11.788 --> 05:21:11.798 align:start position:0%
dependent upon them for those
 
05:21:14.310 --> 05:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
allocations but having another two
 
05:21:16.150 --> 05:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers on board is certainly
 
05:21:17.910 --> 05:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
going to be helpful and help us move us
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
closer to that goal question about
 
05:21:23.070 --> 05:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
teachers and um this is near and dear to
 
05:21:26.310 --> 05:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
my heart um this is these are you know
 
05:21:27.670 --> 05:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
it goes without saying that these are
 
05:21:30.510 --> 05:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
complex ethical questions that we have
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
wrestled with with and we have wrestled
 
05:21:33.430 --> 05:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
with it from the beginning of the
 
05:21:36.150 --> 05:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic and certainly now as the rubber
 
05:21:38.190 --> 05:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
hits the road once the vaccine has been
 
05:21:41.510 --> 05:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
available around who goes first in line
 
05:21:43.430 --> 05:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I think New Hampshire has solidly
 
05:21:47.070 --> 05:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
come down on the notion that the right
 
05:21:50.390 --> 05:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
thing to do right now is to focus on
 
05:21:53.628 --> 05:21:53.638 align:start position:0%
those who are most at risk for the worst
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
of the outcomes associated with
 
05:21:58.510 --> 05:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
covid-19 as we looked at that slide
 
05:22:01.070 --> 05:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
earlier where the deaths are the deaths
 
05:22:05.390 --> 05:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
are among people aged 60 and over um we
 
05:22:07.628 --> 05:22:07.638 align:start position:0%
know that many of the schools and the
 
05:22:10.110 --> 05:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
child care providers in particular who
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
are fa who are working daytoday you know
 
05:22:14.750 --> 05:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of our schools are remote right
 
05:22:16.708 --> 05:22:16.718 align:start position:0%
now and working hybrid which we all
 
05:22:19.548 --> 05:22:19.558 align:start position:0%
agree is not optimal for kids or for
 
05:22:21.948 --> 05:22:21.958 align:start position:0%
staff um but we have childcare providers
 
05:22:25.548 --> 05:22:25.558 align:start position:0%
who are working daytoday with kids um on
 
05:22:27.590 --> 05:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
the floor in a toddler room so that
 
05:22:29.510 --> 05:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
their parents can work and and I know
 
05:22:30.830 --> 05:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
that is the Ways and Means Committee
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
that that that's important to you all as
 
05:22:34.670 --> 05:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
much as anything that that's critical to
 
05:22:37.070 --> 05:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
our infrastructure which is why they are
 
05:22:39.390 --> 05:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
among the only sort of critical
 
05:22:41.788 --> 05:22:41.798 align:start position:0%
infrastructure group that is called out
 
05:22:43.830 --> 05:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
in our plan we needed healthc care
 
05:22:45.788 --> 05:22:45.798 align:start position:0%
providers called out early so that we
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
had a Health Care system for all of us
 
05:22:50.270 --> 05:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
um so that we would not crash our health
 
05:22:52.350 --> 05:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
care facilities and those folks that are
 
05:22:54.430 --> 05:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
most at risk including our First
 
05:22:57.190 --> 05:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
Responders and then the next group that
 
05:22:59.548 --> 05:22:59.558 align:start position:0%
is an industry group that was called out
 
05:23:01.548 --> 05:23:01.558 align:start position:0%
were teachers and child care providers
 
05:23:04.548 --> 05:23:04.558 align:start position:0%
no no other uh critical infrastructure
 
05:23:08.548 --> 05:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
groups um were called out in in that way
 
05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
so we recognize that it's going to be a
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
little while we need to have that Supply
 
05:23:15.788 --> 05:23:15.798 align:start position:0%
um we are focusing on the age groups the
 
05:23:18.868 --> 05:23:18.878 align:start position:0%
65 and older again the the people who
 
05:23:21.390 --> 05:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
are most at risk of dying and having the
 
05:23:23.150 --> 05:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
worst outcomes and worst
 
05:23:24.830 --> 05:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and being on
 
05:23:28.030 --> 05:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
ventilators we know what group that is
 
05:23:30.910 --> 05:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's the decision um
 
05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
that many folks came to right now uh how
 
05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
we got to that decision certainly is a
 
05:23:37.708 --> 05:23:37.718 align:start position:0%
combination of a few things one we have
 
05:23:39.910 --> 05:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
a state disaster medical advisory
 
05:23:43.670 --> 05:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
committee that is a group of um medical
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
providers Physicians and others who help
 
05:23:48.750 --> 05:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
us think about the ethics of these of
 
05:23:50.510 --> 05:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
this decision making and they certainly
 
05:23:53.190 --> 05:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
provided a tremendous amount of feedback
 
05:23:55.110 --> 05:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
and we work with our team of inous
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
disease specialists and Dr Chan and
 
05:23:59.750 --> 05:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
certainly our governor's office to to
 
05:24:02.628 --> 05:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
land in the in the order that we're in
 
05:24:06.430 --> 05:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
right now um I think I I lost your first
 
05:24:07.868 --> 05:24:07.878 align:start position:0%
question there and I didn't write it
 
05:24:10.110 --> 05:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
down um but I think I hit both teachers
 
05:24:13.230 --> 05:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
I think I hit the supply um question
 
05:24:16.110 --> 05:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
first come first come first serve isue
 
05:24:18.430 --> 05:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
or what what the protocol will be for
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
yes so thank thank you for the reminder
 
05:24:22.670 --> 05:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
on that we are still working some of
 
05:24:24.430 --> 05:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
those things out so part of the reason
 
05:24:26.230 --> 05:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
you're not hearing a very clear answer
 
05:24:28.590 --> 05:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
from me right now is that those are the
 
05:24:31.150 --> 05:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
details that are being um determined
 
05:24:33.868 --> 05:24:33.878 align:start position:0%
right now um and we anticipate that the
 
05:24:36.788 --> 05:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
governor is going to have his um press
 
05:24:38.190 --> 05:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
conference tomorrow where he's going to
 
05:24:40.070 --> 05:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
be able to dig in a little bit deeper
 
05:24:43.590 --> 05:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
into those details so um again the team
 
05:24:45.788 --> 05:24:45.798 align:start position:0%
is working very hard at this minute to
 
05:24:48.030 --> 05:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are successful and
 
05:24:49.708 --> 05:24:49.718 align:start position:0%
that the people who should be first in
 
05:24:53.150 --> 05:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
the line are first in the
 
05:24:58.750 --> 05:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
line thank you okay um representative
 
05:25:01.628 --> 05:25:01.638 align:start position:0%
southware am I unmuted
 
05:25:05.350 --> 05:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
yeah hi thank you for all your efforts
 
05:25:08.110 --> 05:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted a clarification so um
 
05:25:10.868 --> 05:25:10.878 align:start position:0%
you'll sign up um which probably means
 
05:25:13.070 --> 05:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh personal information your email stuff
 
05:25:15.030 --> 05:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
like that then will you basically get an
 
05:25:16.708 --> 05:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
email with an appointment and something
 
05:25:20.270 --> 05:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
you print yes so you will sign up you
 
05:25:21.948 --> 05:25:21.958 align:start position:0%
will then find out that you are
 
05:25:23.390 --> 05:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
registered you'll you'll get a
 
05:25:25.590 --> 05:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
confirmation that you're registered and
 
05:25:28.590 --> 05:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
then later you will get an email with an
 
05:25:31.350 --> 05:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
appointment date um you you know when we
 
05:25:33.430 --> 05:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
did this with our First Responders and
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
the health care providers the Ambulatory
 
05:25:37.910 --> 05:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
Care Health Providers they were um our
 
05:25:40.510 --> 05:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
first to go at using this process and so
 
05:25:43.070 --> 05:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
what we found was sometimes um we were
 
05:25:45.750 --> 05:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
able to turn around um appointment times
 
05:25:47.750 --> 05:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
very quickly sometimes it took you know
 
05:25:49.788 --> 05:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
upwards of a week or more to get a
 
05:25:52.030 --> 05:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
response with the excuse me with the
 
05:25:55.470 --> 05:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
appointment time so again those details
 
05:25:57.270 --> 05:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
um folks are working around the clock
 
05:25:59.350 --> 05:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
right now to make sure that our system
 
05:26:02.110 --> 05:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
is up and ready we are all committed for
 
05:26:06.270 --> 05:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
it to go live um by Friday um and so
 
05:26:08.070 --> 05:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
there will be more details to come and I
 
05:26:10.470 --> 05:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
anticipate when the governor and um Dr
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
Chan and Dr Daly do their press
 
05:26:14.190 --> 05:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
conference tomorrow you will get to that
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
level of detail uh thank you and do you
 
05:26:19.590 --> 05:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
have a time for that press conference is
 
05:26:22.750 --> 05:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
it usually at 5:30 or 6 or something um
 
05:26:24.510 --> 05:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
I don't have the time directly my
 
05:26:25.628 --> 05:26:25.638 align:start position:0%
understandings it's typically a little
 
05:26:28.270 --> 05:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
bit earlier in the afternoon
 
05:26:32.390 --> 05:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
05:26:36.150 --> 05:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative bar me yes thanks Norm uh
 
05:26:38.830 --> 05:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
real quick um so what's the end game
 
05:26:41.948 --> 05:26:41.958 align:start position:0%
here um what kind of metrics are going
 
05:26:45.708 --> 05:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
to be in place to say that we've won um
 
05:26:48.030 --> 05:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be a combination of cases
 
05:26:51.070 --> 05:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
deaths hospitalizations number of people
 
05:26:53.350 --> 05:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated is it everybody is it going
 
05:26:56.708 --> 05:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
to be zero uh zero cases or has that
 
05:27:00.628 --> 05:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
been thought through yet so I and I'm
 
05:27:02.670 --> 05:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
ask to have a crystal ball here but
 
05:27:04.868 --> 05:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
we're we're struggling to understand get
 
05:27:07.470 --> 05:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
kind of a timeline and what would have
 
05:27:10.030 --> 05:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
to be in place for uh the restrictions
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
to be loosened a little bit and for
 
05:27:14.470 --> 05:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
businesses to really start coming back
 
05:27:17.990 --> 05:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
to normal absolutely thank you um
 
05:27:20.110 --> 05:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
representative arami I mean you are
 
05:27:22.548 --> 05:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
asking the million-dollar question of
 
05:27:24.948 --> 05:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
you know when will we know um we
 
05:27:28.670 --> 05:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
certainly know it's not today um are we
 
05:27:30.470 --> 05:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the cases are Contin
 
05:27:33.030 --> 05:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
continuing to be high as I noted you
 
05:27:34.628 --> 05:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
know we're in a very different place
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
today than we were this summer where you
 
05:27:38.670 --> 05:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
know we were routinely talking about 20
 
05:27:40.510 --> 05:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
cases a day and now we're talking about
 
05:27:43.830 --> 05:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
600 or more cases per day um the good
 
05:27:47.350 --> 05:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
news is is that um our both the science
 
05:27:49.948 --> 05:27:49.958 align:start position:0%
has gotten better and Medical Treatments
 
05:27:52.788 --> 05:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
have gotten better so um we can treat
 
05:27:56.070 --> 05:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
covid um more effectively today than we
 
05:27:58.470 --> 05:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
did last year at this time where we had
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
such high death rates where everyone who
 
05:28:03.750 --> 05:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
was you know at that critical age we we
 
05:28:05.270 --> 05:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
at that critical stage when they were in
 
05:28:09.230 --> 05:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
the hospital so um we know that folks
 
05:28:12.750 --> 05:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
like Dr fouchy and others have said 70%
 
05:28:15.788 --> 05:28:15.798 align:start position:0%
is sort of the end game for vaccination
 
05:28:17.910 --> 05:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
that people would love to have as a goal
 
05:28:20.350 --> 05:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
for getting vaccinated in order to have
 
05:28:22.708 --> 05:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
some more control of the spread of the
 
05:28:25.150 --> 05:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
disease um we don't know how long it'll
 
05:28:26.830 --> 05:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
take to get there again it's a complex
 
05:28:29.910 --> 05:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
mixture of metrics of supply of how you
 
05:28:32.310 --> 05:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
get those um vaccine here and how fast
 
05:28:34.548 --> 05:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
we can get it out into the arms of other
 
05:28:37.310 --> 05:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
people but um we anticipate especially
 
05:28:38.708 --> 05:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
with the new variant that we're going to
 
05:28:40.270 --> 05:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
continue to have some high numbers for
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
some time now but as we see people um
 
05:28:46.110 --> 05:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinated we should see those numbers
 
05:28:49.590 --> 05:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
come down and I think then is when folks
 
05:28:51.190 --> 05:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
like the governor's office and our
 
05:28:53.190 --> 05:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
reopening task force and others are
 
05:28:55.390 --> 05:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
going to wrestle with that question of
 
05:28:57.590 --> 05:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
when will it be time to start loosening
 
05:29:00.430 --> 05:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
up on some of the protocols that we have
 
05:29:03.788 --> 05:29:03.798 align:start position:0%
in place today we know it's not today we
 
05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
know we need to get through a lot of
 
05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine first okay thank you would see
 
05:29:11.310 --> 05:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh Norm it would seem that would be
 
05:29:14.910 --> 05:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
great if we could uh touch Bas with uh
 
05:29:16.548 --> 05:29:16.558 align:start position:0%
Patricia and others from the Department
 
05:29:19.510 --> 05:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
of Health periodically As We As Time
 
05:29:21.628 --> 05:29:21.638 align:start position:0%
Marches on here just to so we get a
 
05:29:26.788 --> 05:29:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:30.510 --> 05:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
you we'll have her follow up on that uh
 
05:29:33.910 --> 05:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative Aly and followed by
 
05:29:33.920 --> 05:29:36.150 align:start position:0%
uh representative Aly and followed by
representative

05:29:36.150 --> 05:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:29:41.390 --> 05:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
Tor yeah mine's on quick now I think on
 
05:29:46.948 --> 05:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
when we sign up on on the website will
 
05:29:52.390 --> 05:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
we be asked to put in our age and our
 
05:29:56.270 --> 05:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
conditions great thank you so um you
 
05:29:58.030 --> 05:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
will likely need to put in your age you
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
will need to put in a birth date likely
 
05:30:03.708 --> 05:30:03.718 align:start position:0%
and and um the medical conditions um are
 
05:30:05.350 --> 05:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
we're working closely with our healthc
 
05:30:06.990 --> 05:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
care providers because they are going to
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
provide some
 
05:30:11.310 --> 05:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
attestation um and have a form that they
 
05:30:14.670 --> 05:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
will need to sign um that will attest
 
05:30:17.430 --> 05:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
that uh this that the individual has the
 
05:30:18.788 --> 05:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
conditions that they say that that they
 
05:30:21.150 --> 05:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
have two or more conditions uh it is
 
05:30:22.670 --> 05:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
unlikely that we'll be tracking the
 
05:30:24.470 --> 05:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
exact conditions that people have but
 
05:30:27.150 --> 05:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
certainly that they meet the threshold
 
05:30:31.510 --> 05:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
of um of that medically vulnerable group
 
05:30:33.750 --> 05:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
and again more details on what it's all
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to look like um I think will be
 
05:30:39.470 --> 05:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
available um tomorrow um and again I
 
05:30:40.708 --> 05:30:40.718 align:start position:0%
apologize for not having that
 
05:30:43.070 --> 05:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
information today but we are we are
 
05:30:45.030 --> 05:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
literally working on it as we speak so
 
05:30:46.590 --> 05:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
that it's ready to go and I I don't want
 
05:30:49.230 --> 05:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
to um promise something that or or
 
05:30:50.708 --> 05:30:50.718 align:start position:0%
describe something that may change
 
05:30:53.190 --> 05:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
between now and
 
05:30:55.390 --> 05:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
Friday so we are going to put in our
 
05:30:59.590 --> 05:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
medical providers at least um if you are
 
05:31:02.430 --> 05:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
um if you have the that medic you fall
 
05:31:04.948 --> 05:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
into that medically vulnerable
 
05:31:07.868 --> 05:31:07.878 align:start position:0%
information uh or medically vulnerable
 
05:31:11.070 --> 05:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
category now if you are simply age
 
05:31:13.350 --> 05:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate um you will not need to
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
provide your medical information so if
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
you are 65 or older that will be good
 
05:31:20.470 --> 05:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
enough as the as the vaccine phase
 
05:31:23.070 --> 05:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
Checker um as you used on the website
 
05:31:25.788 --> 05:31:25.798 align:start position:0%
doeses you know you hit 65 plus and you
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
know you're automatically in in group
 
05:31:29.160 --> 05:31:30.868 align:start position:0%
know you're automatically in in group
1B

05:31:30.868 --> 05:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
1B
 
05:31:34.350 --> 05:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
and this is also um in part um you know
 
05:31:36.548 --> 05:31:36.558 align:start position:0%
we want to reduce the burden as much as
 
05:31:38.548 --> 05:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
possible on the health care providers as
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
well um you know we want them to uh we
 
05:31:43.750 --> 05:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
know that this is a huge lift for them
 
05:31:45.390 --> 05:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
and we are very grateful to their
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
partnership because they now have to be
 
05:31:50.948 --> 05:31:50.958 align:start position:0%
working with their panel of patients um
 
05:31:53.350 --> 05:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
especially those who are under 65 who
 
05:31:55.350 --> 05:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
have those medical conditions they want
 
05:31:58.470 --> 05:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to make sure that they can um
 
05:32:00.270 --> 05:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
take care of those folks as well as
 
05:32:04.350 --> 05:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:08.830 --> 05:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
older representative um t a great
 
05:32:10.548 --> 05:32:10.558 align:start position:0%

one well Patricia I mean s had
 
05:32:26.670 --> 05:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
your number of
 
05:32:28.990 --> 05:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative major I'm sorry
 
05:32:31.350 --> 05:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
to interrupt um um but representative
 
05:32:33.470 --> 05:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
Edwards raised his hand in the attendee
 
05:32:36.350 --> 05:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
panel I know we're we're quite away over
 
05:32:37.948 --> 05:32:37.958 align:start position:0%
time but I just wanted to bring that to
 
05:32:40.590 --> 05:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
your attention in case you wanted to
 
05:32:43.070 --> 05:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
question represent
 
05:32:45.830 --> 05:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
Edwards just a
 
05:32:47.910 --> 05:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
moment okay representative Edwards you
 
05:32:49.830 --> 05:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
can unmute and
 
05:32:54.350 --> 05:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
speak okay uh Miss Tilly it's always a
 
05:32:58.190 --> 05:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
one wonderful event hearing you um you
 
05:33:00.510 --> 05:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
you use the term partnership
 
05:33:02.750 --> 05:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
with our uh health care providers
 
05:33:05.868 --> 05:33:05.878 align:start position:0%
because we know how much workload that's
 
05:33:08.390 --> 05:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
getting put on them I just would like
 
05:33:11.868 --> 05:33:11.878 align:start position:0%
you to know I've had three different U
 
05:33:14.990 --> 05:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
Family Practice type people one PA and
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
two doctors reach out to me and say that
 
05:33:21.190 --> 05:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
the workload being imposed by the
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination program is intense it's
 
05:33:27.470 --> 05:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
breaking them it's costing them a lot of
 
05:33:30.110 --> 05:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
money so so it's good that you you're
 
05:33:32.510 --> 05:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
saying you're going to do what you can
 
05:33:34.708 --> 05:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
as a department to reduce the workload
 
05:33:37.150 --> 05:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
burden but I just want to hear a little
 
05:33:40.230 --> 05:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
bit more about the appreciation that
 
05:33:43.030 --> 05:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't a partnership This Is Us jam
 
05:33:47.110 --> 05:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
refuse thank you representative Edwards
 
05:33:52.430 --> 05:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
um there is no doubt that this is
 
05:33:56.110 --> 05:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
burdensome um we know that um and I use
 
05:33:57.670 --> 05:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
the term partnership it is not a
 
05:34:00.310 --> 05:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
euphemism it's true appreci app ation
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
for the work that we can't do it without
 
05:34:05.110 --> 05:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
them I think we all share the notion
 
05:34:06.548 --> 05:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
however that we want to get folks
 
05:34:08.910 --> 05:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and we want to prioritize
 
05:34:11.390 --> 05:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
those that are medically NE medically
 
05:34:14.270 --> 05:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable um and we have to have some
 
05:34:18.548 --> 05:34:18.558 align:start position:0%
process to do that um so part again part
 
05:34:21.708 --> 05:34:21.718 align:start position:0%
of the conversation of reducing to 65
 
05:34:23.628 --> 05:34:23.638 align:start position:0%
plus is that may relieve a little bit of
 
05:34:26.070 --> 05:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
Burden again to certify whether folks
 
05:34:27.910 --> 05:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
are medically vulnerable or not because
 
05:34:30.270 --> 05:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
they meet the category if you're 6 and
 
05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
older you check you're in you're in that
 
05:34:35.430 --> 05:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
group um we know that people have
 
05:34:37.510 --> 05:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
intense relationships with their medical
 
05:34:40.350 --> 05:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
provider so we know that even if we said
 
05:34:42.030 --> 05:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
don't call your medical provider people
 
05:34:43.708 --> 05:34:43.718 align:start position:0%
would still be calling them up on the
 
05:34:46.830 --> 05:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
phone because we have such um long-term
 
05:34:48.750 --> 05:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
relationships with them and especially
 
05:34:50.910 --> 05:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
those of us that may have um multiple
 
05:34:52.750 --> 05:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
medical conditions we want to know from
 
05:34:54.390 --> 05:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
our medical provider that this is the
 
05:34:58.670 --> 05:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
right thing to do um so we appreciate I
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much more can say that
 
05:35:02.750 --> 05:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the work that that um that
 
05:35:05.070 --> 05:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
is in front of them right now it is a
 
05:35:07.948 --> 05:35:07.958 align:start position:0%
burden for all of us to move forward to
 
05:35:09.990 --> 05:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
move quickly at the pace at which we are
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
moving during this pandemic it has been
 
05:35:14.590 --> 05:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary time so thank you in
 
05:35:16.190 --> 05:35:16.200 align:start position:0%

05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
others are primarily associated with the
 
05:39:06.670 --> 05:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
budget the bills that we're going to be
 
05:39:08.708 --> 05:39:08.718 align:start position:0%

15 House Bill

05:39:32.788 --> 05:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
353 House Bill
 
05:39:37.990 --> 05:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:45.350 --> 05:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
568 and that will be a uh a hybrid
 
05:39:48.468 --> 05:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
arrangement we have three other days the
 
05:39:52.270 --> 05:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
4th 11th and 17th of February that I'm
 
05:39:54.868 --> 05:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
asking for but it hasn't been finalized
 
05:39:56.430 --> 05:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
yet where
 
05:40:00.070 --> 05:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
we plan on hearing all all the rest of
 
05:40:02.830 --> 05:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
our bills there'll be either six or
 
05:40:06.468 --> 05:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
seven bills each of those days those are
 
05:40:08.590 --> 05:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
the bills that are currently in
 
05:40:11.190 --> 05:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
committee we will be getting additional
 
05:40:14.390 --> 05:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
bills in the committee because we
 
05:40:16.150 --> 05:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
anything that has to do with revenues
 
05:40:18.788 --> 05:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
that went to a policy committee ahead of
 
05:40:22.150 --> 05:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
time they passed the the session will
 
05:40:26.948 --> 05:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
come to us as the second committee bill
 
05:40:31.510 --> 05:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
now the bills that will be hearing
 
05:40:34.150 --> 05:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
initially we may have to have a
 
05:40:38.468 --> 05:40:38.478 align:start position:0%
committee of as a whole to go into these
 
05:40:40.590 --> 05:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
bills because there's questions and
 
05:40:42.628 --> 05:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
things that need to be done with
 
05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
them it's recommended that we do not go
 
05:40:47.628 --> 05:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
to subcommittees because they don't have
 
05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
enough room to do
 
05:40:53.270 --> 05:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittees so uh we will bundle them
 
05:40:56.990 --> 05:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
together and uh committee as a whole to
 
05:40:58.750 --> 05:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
deal with them what we normally would
 
05:41:01.830 --> 05:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:03.868 --> 05:41:03.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and we'll go from there
 
05:41:06.868 --> 05:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
and then as as we can we'll do our
 
05:41:06.878 --> 05:41:08.510 align:start position:0%
and then as as we can we'll do our
executive

05:41:08.510 --> 05:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
executive
 
05:41:11.788 --> 05:41:11.798 align:start position:0%
sessions what we also want to do is is
 
05:41:14.590 --> 05:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
try to identify those bills that we feel
 
05:41:18.070 --> 05:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
need a lot of work and they and they
 
05:41:21.430 --> 05:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
should that work should be done would be
 
05:41:23.548 --> 05:41:23.558 align:start position:0%
candidates for
 
05:41:26.590 --> 05:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
retaining retaining so that
 
05:41:30.430 --> 05:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully next year will be back in a
 
05:41:33.910 --> 05:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
normal environment and we can do these
 
05:41:35.990 --> 05:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
in a correct
 
05:41:38.230 --> 05:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
way all
 
05:41:41.430 --> 05:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
right so we have our work cut out for us
 
05:41:44.750 --> 05:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
the goal is is to come up with our
 
05:41:48.628 --> 05:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates shortly after the
 
05:41:51.468 --> 05:41:51.478 align:start position:0%
governor presents his budget from
 
05:41:51.478 --> 05:41:53.110 align:start position:0%
governor presents his budget from
revenue

05:41:53.110 --> 05:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
05:41:56.350 --> 05:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
estimates to the finance
 
05:42:00.310 --> 05:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
committee once that happens trying to
 
05:42:02.990 --> 05:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
and making arrangements to have the
 
05:42:06.468 --> 05:42:06.478 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director meet with us
 
05:42:06.478 --> 05:42:08.548 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director meet with us
to

05:42:08.548 --> 05:42:08.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:42:08.558 --> 05:42:10.150 align:start position:0%
to
explain

05:42:10.150 --> 05:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
explain
 
05:42:13.030 --> 05:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
his Revenue estimat so we'll have some
 
05:42:15.628 --> 05:42:15.638 align:start position:0%
intelligence on what he did because in
 
05:42:19.390 --> 05:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
his Revenue estimates might be uh
 
05:42:22.868 --> 05:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
revenues that are more than what current
 
05:42:25.788 --> 05:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
LA is when we do our Revenue estimates
 
05:42:28.948 --> 05:42:28.958 align:start position:0%
is just based on current law so that we
 
05:42:31.270 --> 05:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
can pull out out of his Revenue
 
05:42:33.990 --> 05:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
estimates things that would
 
05:42:37.468 --> 05:42:37.478 align:start position:0%
require uh rate uh rate changes or
 
05:42:39.708 --> 05:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue
 
05:42:42.310 --> 05:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
sources and we'll get that
 
05:42:47.468 --> 05:42:47.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:50.430 --> 05:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
