thank you for that okay I'm G to open up
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
our first public hearing House Bill
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
1329 relative to creating special number
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
plates for fire departments and the
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the prime sponsor
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
this will be the easy one of the two
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
bills I have today in here so I was
 
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
approached by the chief of the exitor
 
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
fire department and he thought it would
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
be a a good thing to have the license
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
plates like the Cruisers have you know
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
they have MP and there's a designation
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
that tells you what town they're from
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
and what number Cruiser it is and he was
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
looking to do something very similar to
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
that for the fire service uh plate that
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
stands out that it's a fire department
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle and you know and we'll come up
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
with the code probably following what
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
the police use for the town designations
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
seeing how they already have them and U
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
thing and that's about all I have I'll
 
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.710 align:start position:0%
thing and that's about all I have I'll
take

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh yeah any questions from the
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
committee rep representative rich
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
a volunteer dep does that make any
 
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
differ no it's for all okay all of the
 
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
fire department Vehicles not like the
 
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.310 align:start position:0%
fire department Vehicles not like the
individual

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
members any other questions yeah I do uh
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
can you refresh my memory what do they
 
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
have for plates now for the municial
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles for for the fire department
 
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
yeah just the G plates the government
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
plates okay but the police have their so
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
they have on a blue stripe that comes
 
00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
down the side says MP Municipal Police
 
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:06.519 align:start position:0%
and then in blue letters their town code
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
and the cruiser code or vehicle code yep
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
representative Hill I'm sorry what what
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
would be the benefit of that but so I
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
know like some of the chief's cars
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
aren't don't have the big light bars on
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
them anymore so they're looking so that
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
they can be identified as a fire vehicle
 
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
as they approach a scene um
 
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
and it just lets people know that it is
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
a fire department vehicle
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
not like
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
our I work in E
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
eping and our fire inspector has a
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
retired police car that we tried to
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
dress up as much as we can as a fire car
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
and because my selectman won't let us
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
put a nice big fire patch on it we have
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
to put the town seal so police and that
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
car still look quite a lot alike and she
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
gets accused of being a police officer
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
all the time and she really hates that
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
so if you had the red plate on there
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
they would know that it's the fire
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
department not the police department y
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman um and
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um does
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
it are you
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
limited why why would it matter I guess
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
um is there are there circumstan
 
00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0%
where having the government plate on it
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
um gets you stopped going to a scene
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
instead of it could be you
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
know I've been pulled
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
over um then again not in my vehicle but
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
I have lights that weren't on I was
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
headed to a call but didn't think I
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
really need needed to put my lights on
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
on the highway because sometimes that
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
just causes people confusion and such so
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
he was just cruising along and got
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
stopped but they did let me go when they
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
told him I was going to a call another
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
followup followup please um but that's
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
on your personal vehicle I agree what
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to dra the distinction so I'm
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
going to tell you my Chief's car right
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
now you wouldn't know it's a fire car
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
right so he could be scooting down the
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
road and if he didn't have all his red
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
lights on you would get stopped but it
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
has a government plate yes okay thank
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
you and why is he scooting down the road
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
without his lights on well sometimes if
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
you're like the third went in on the
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
call and you're just going there to
 
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
supervise like I said sometimes it's
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
better to be stealthy
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
because people do crazy things when they
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
see lights in the rear view mirror like
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
stomp on the brakes in the middle of the
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
road so fair enough I was just having a
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
little fun we're just trying to We're
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
just trying to loosen up for a a long
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
day here this wasn't my idea
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
this was the
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
chief and I don't see him so fair enough
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh any other
 
00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
questions representer Fox thank you Mr
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
chairman um so just so it's clear these
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
are for fire department owned vehicles
 
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
and not personal vehicles that are used
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
for Fire Department business correct
 
00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:24.550 align:start position:0%
for Fire Department business correct
thank

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
you apparently the exitor fire chief
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
just wants to be a cop in Disguise so he
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
wants his own little plates that what I
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
can tell you representative Jones Thank
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
presenting this um so I heard you say
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
red so these these wouldn't be the
 
00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:44.839 align:start position:0%
traditional license plate colors of New
 
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these would be R so on the
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
police one there's a stripe that comes
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
down the the Leading Edge right that and
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
in it is MP Municipal Police in white
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
letters so so I'm assuming we would do
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
the red stripe down and it would
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
have you know uh
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
FM right and then the letters would be
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
readed on the white background oh okay
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
good answer thank
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
you okay representative gisy thank you
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you represented
 
00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just for me to
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
get clarity would a fire can a
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
firefighter get these plates for their
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle no thank
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.230 align:start position:0%

very

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
much and for everybody I don't have a
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
card from the New Hampshire uh
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety War mode Vehicles
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
so apparently they don't have a position
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
and it is a relatively small fiscal note
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh chair recogniz is next up
 
00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:54.149 align:start position:0%

McGuff did I pronounce that
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
gets it right uh it's representative M

committee for the first time in about
 
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
23 years oddly enough the last time I
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
was here and this is this was the
 
00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
beginning of my testimony on the next
 
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
bill oddly the last time I was here was
 
00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:22.039 align:start position:0%
also for a special plate bill and I know
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
how you love them because chairman
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
Packard our current Speaker also loved
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
them 22 years ago and you may detect a
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
little sarcasm in my voice um I did not
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
know I didn't happen to notice that
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative PR's bill I think we were
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
elected together as freshmen actually uh
 
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
I didn't happen to notice that his bill
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
was on the calendar just before mine but
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
I wanted to take less than two minutes
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
to tell you why I think it's a good idea
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
and why I think you should consider and
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
and I believe this has come up before
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
even after I introduced it 20 years ago
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
I think you should consider um AAL
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
special plate in addition an actual
 
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:02.919 align:start position:0%
special plate like many states do with a
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
mtis cross or Star of Life or EMS or
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
fire responders especially the volunteer
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
towns um I was a volunteer for many many
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
years I'm still licensed paramedic in
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
three states 33 years now uh and my
 
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
eight or so years on marac ambulance
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
rescue service that was a constant issue
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
um you know getting plates back or you
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
know just having the Little Rocker plate
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
that we've all seen before that usually
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
goes above
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
um a a a plate that has the proper
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
symbol multis Cross or Star of Life is
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
what's commonly done in many other
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
states you've probably seen them in New
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
York and Pennsylvania 80% of EMS is
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
provided EMS and fire in the state or of
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
EMS fire Personnel in the country are
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
volunteers of course the other 20% do
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
80% of the calls so in you know fair
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
fair disclosure so anyway that's my only
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
input on this um I do think it's it's a
 
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
good idea whatever we can do to
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
distinguish it especially these days
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
when you roll up on the scene when you
 
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:04.039 align:start position:0%
when you onsite something and people
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
wonder who the heck are you and you have
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
to say well I'm a paramedic and maybe
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
they believe you maybe they don't you
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily want to pull your
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
license out but if you're driving a car
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
that has a multis cross on it uh or a
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
starve life on it they're much more
 
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
likely to accept your assistance
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
roadside for those of us that still uh
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
stop and don't practice the EMS salute
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
and Drive
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
by so so I'd encourage you to consider
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
that that's all thank you very much
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
questions on the practicality of that or
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
anything questions from the
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative sellers yeah
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so just to be clear I
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure so
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
these I'm maybe I'm hearing double
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm ask these would be on my
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
personal vehicle with the symbol on
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
there that would indicate so people know
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
that you're driving up would have uh
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
that you're an EMS or fire correct
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
during your either off duty response or
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
on duty volunteer response I mean at it
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
at Mar m amulance rescue service when
 
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
that organization still existed to
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
augment the the full-time fire which it
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't any longer uh but we had teams
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
each night of four or five uh volunteer
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
responders that would respond from their
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
home in their personal vehicles
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative dry marget dry is is one
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
of those folks um or Virginia dry um
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
that has done it for many many years she
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
could actually speak to it if she
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
happened to be here but um there's a lot
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
of volunteer EMS and a lot of volunteer
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
fire in the state many times you're
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
responding directly to the scene in your
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
personal vehicle sometimes you're
 
00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:35.559 align:start position:0%
responding to the ambulance garage or
 
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
fire fire station to pick up a vehicle
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
but in any case it makes it considerably
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
more easy to identify uh in my opinion I
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
know we've had this bill a couple of
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
times and we have a lot of special
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
plates but times have changed in terms
 
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
of people you know believing when you
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
present yourself as a as a professional
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
license provider you know are you aren't
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
you if you have a plate I think gets a
 
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
so representative Fox thank you Mr
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
chairman I I just asked that question of
 
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
Representative PR and he answered
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
totally differently he said they would
 
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
not be used for on personal vehicles
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
they would be used only for vehicles
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
owned by the fire department indeed
 
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing up and I should
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
have been made it more clear I'm
 
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
suggesting an addition to this bill or
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment to use this bill as a
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
vehicle to do that also to accomplish
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
what we of proof suggesting and
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
something else in that's Germain uh to
 
00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:35.559 align:start position:0%
it so I am suggesting Amendment I'm
 
00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
happy to prepare it I'm I'm sure I have
 
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
it drafted from prior thank
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
you well it does save my question
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
because I was trying to see where it
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
would apply to volunteer and I don't see
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
that here either yeah okay uh any other
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%

for surviving spouses of
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
veterans um chair recognizes the prime
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor of Representative Sellers and I
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
see somebody else is that representative
 
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
CBO yes sir okay two out of the way
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning uh Mr chair and
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
transportation committee I appreciate
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
the time here and this is a uh a bill
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
that I sponsored and Prime sponsored as
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
a a veterans bill because of a
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
constituent has heard or run into a
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
problem where the spouse would pass away
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
and this bill would say within a year or
 
00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:47.559 align:start position:0%
just after a year the um the surviving
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
spouse would have to give up the
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
veterans plate that they might have had
 
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
for a long time and so this person
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to actually say you know this
 
00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
should be until maybe the spouse gets
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
remarried or
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
indefinitely if they don't remarry
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
because it's very personal to them and
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
that's why they would like to keep the
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
plates at this point so that that's the
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
main gist of this and he on the sheet I
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
provided you is just informational on
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
different areas and and uh part of the
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
law there that you know it is affected
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
by this
 
00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:27.799 align:start position:0%
so not sure what more I can say on it
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
and but I'm willing for questions and
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
the other representative here do you
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
want to say something now I would see if
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
they have any questions for sure let's
 
00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
do questions thank
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
just get you to state your name excuse

I have a question and you'll have to
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
forgive my lack of
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge but other than signifying that
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
the person in the car or may be a
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
veteran or is a veteran do you get any
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
are there any special privileges that
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
come with having a veteran's license
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
plate on a car in a state of New
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether it's parking or tolls
 
00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:30.669 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether it's parking or tolls
or

00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
anything so I personally have a veterans
 
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
license plate except for right now but
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's still in the back of my tra my
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
truck in the back seat not not that I'm
 
00:28:43.509 --> 00:28:43.519 align:start position:0%
aware I mean it's just a a status that I
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
was a veteran or a veteran of a
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
particular service but I don't get
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
special parking or free parking or free
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
tolls or anything else like that they
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
working on that quick followup yep
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
so I guess
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
again nothing zero just a strictly like
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
you said a status or just letting people
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
know not anything that that's my
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
understanding and I've been using my
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
plate for years and I've gotten nothing
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
except the status to let other people
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
know that I'm a veteran that's it thank
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank you
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
question question um I guess it's a
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
two-part question one there's no um
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
current charge as I recall for having a
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
correct I I can't remember I it's not
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
free it's not free it's it may be the
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
same cost as a regular plate but I I
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's
 
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
free um okay well I think we can get
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
that answer as we come along but the
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
other part of this is do you know of any
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.789 align:start position:0%
other part of this is do you know of any
reason

00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
um anything magical about that one year
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
that you're able to take the plate is
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
there a uh is there a
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
um if that was changed to five years
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
would it make any any difference um
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
regarding the law um there's no there's
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
nothing magical about that one is that
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
what I understand from well the the
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
current law does say one right so they
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
and they want to make it indefinite I
 
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
like to make it indefinite
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
right uh if we made it five years I
 
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's any conflict any
 
00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:36.039 align:start position:0%
place else I'm not aware of that uh and
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
and again all that might do is delay the
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
person the the surviving spouse um
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
needing or being forced to get another
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
plate um followup yeah follow up thank
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
you um but it's not for purposes of
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
identification of of who is is driving
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
the car or something like that there's
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
no there's no um
 
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.519 align:start position:0%
special designation that uh that that
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
person who was technically not a veteran
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
would be driving that car there's no um
 
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
there's nothing stopping someone driving
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
a car that has veteran plates even
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
though they weren't a veteran is that
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
right that is correct I even I other
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
household members in my house they use
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
my vehicle and my plates are on it so
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
there's nothing stopping just it's not
 
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
like a handicap placard right and
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
parking someplace and putting it up or
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
having a handicap plate it's uh it's not
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
like that at all it's literally no
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
different than a regular plate but it's
 
00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
just an
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
identification thank you and that's true
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
of all of these in
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
this testimony correct yeah yeah better
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
you um just for the committee's
 
00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge we do have uh a member of the
 
00:31:59.950 --> 00:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
state veterans advisory committee here
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak so if the questions
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
are more appropriate to that person like
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
the one I have uh you can hold off uh
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the sponsors go
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
ahead representative
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
you for being here and thank you for
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
your service um this seems like
 
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
a uh wear your hard on your sleeve type
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
of issue
 
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh and it kind helps the spouse keep the
 
00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:32.519 align:start position:0%
Legacy going so I I like that part of it
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
I just some clarity on some of the
 
00:32:36.669 --> 00:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
things you already answered
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
so a spouse can't apply for it after the
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
after the this decease of the first
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
spouse right it has to be a carryover
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
and and the other part you mentioned was
 
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
if they
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
remarry they don't have the right to to
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
use that plate anymore they would have
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
you the other one thing I want to state
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
is I just happened to hear from a
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
constituent just yesterday he says
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
because they they came on the other side
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
of it and say well the veterans plate
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
there is for a veteran and someone else
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's has it on the vehicle that their
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
spous has passed away they were never a
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
veteran so they're saying you know is
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
this right to be able to have so looking
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
at both sides of the coin one was saying
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
yes I'm a veteran I have a right to have
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
that plate and the other side saying
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
well you never served why you have that
 
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
plate so speak I just want to bring that
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
up and just so everybody is on the same
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
page not try to hide I would speak to
 
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
this part
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
um my family's been in the military for
 
00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
as long as I can remember my father
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to get into the army but my
 
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
grandfather was uncles I went to a
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%

00:34:56.589 --> 00:34:56.599 align:start position:0%
assistant um I saw a lot of veterans who
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
did not not have really good resiliency
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
skills I watched their families Reach
 
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
Out desperately for me to help um as
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
their provider for medical assisted
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
treatment for substance use
 
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
disorder I know what their families are
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
going through even if you don't
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
recognize they may not be veterans but
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
they're just as invested in supporting
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
those veterans this is a very tiny
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
population of the country that are
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
willing to step up and do this even less
 
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
of them are willing to give their entire
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
careers this is a very small act for the
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
general court of New Hampshire to give
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
to these families yes it's just an honor
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
but it is a symbol thank you thank
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
you representative rbo thank you Mr
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question I
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about the remarriage Clause
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
was that sort of an effort to compromise
 
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:51.640 align:start position:0%
or find balance between folks saying
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
that you weren't a veteran yourself to
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
about okay because I I can see an
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
argument to not need that addition even
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
if someone did remarry you know to still
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
be able to keep the plate but I was
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
curious I I think that once you've made
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
a commitment to somebody else I think
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
that honor would probably in in
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
rightfully ethically I feel should fall
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
away okay um but I do want to add that
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
if there is any wording that's in this
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
bill that you find contested um I would
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
ask you to let us know what we can do to
 
00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
fix it um and pass thank you thank you
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.950 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
much

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh next up chair recognizes
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative M who is in support of
 
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.670 align:start position:0%
representative M who is in support of
the

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
bill good morning again wow three times
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
in 22 years two in a row on license
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
plate bills it's probably not a record
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
but um so I I am here as a co-sponsor
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
and in support of this bill and I've
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony to the clerk
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
which I'm happy to email out as well or
 
00:36:57.069 --> 00:36:57.079 align:start position:0%
or the clerk could um it's a pretty
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
simple Bill helps support and remember
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
and honor the enduring Legacy of the
 
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.470 align:start position:0%
and honor the enduring Legacy of the
deceased

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
deceased
 
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
veteran um constituents came to me
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
specifically constituents involved with
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
who work with surviving spouses and the
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
Military Officers Association and the
 
00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
surviving spouses of those those
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
military veterans um a few of the
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
constituents are getting on in years and
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
it's on their mind the presence of that
 
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:29.079 align:start position:0%
veterans plate on their husband or
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
wife's vehicle it's a source of Pride
 
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
and a source of honor and it's something
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
they want to hang on to and right now
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
they can't after a certain period of
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
time they are likely to be presented
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
with that flag
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
gravide that'll go on the Manel and
 
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
that'll be pretty significant to them
 
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
but that everyday reminder uh on
 
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
probably on the vehicle that their
 
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
spouse may may have maintained to
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
military standards at least the the ones
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
that I've spoken
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
to um it's a real source of Pride and it
 
00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't come with any real special
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
privileges everything else you need your
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
DD214 or military ID for you know to go
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
down to hansam and Shop or get into the
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
state parks or that sort of thing so
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
really the purpose of this bill is just
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
to recognize that unique and enduring
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
connection of surviving spouses it's
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
that simple few more details in my
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
written testimony but some of it some of
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's already been said so I'll keep it
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
short no thank you for that any question
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.069 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none

down the road as well that we're
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
following but I want to just give you an
 
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
idea of what we do uh because some of
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
you may be new to the committee the
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
state veterans advisory committee is is
 
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
uh chartered by state RSA 115 colon a-8
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
if you want to look it up uh and we're
 
00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
we have 20 member organizations that are
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
that are sponsored by veteran support
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state these are
 
00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
names that would be familiar with you to
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
you the American Legion the Veterans of
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
Foreign Wars all of the I represent the
 
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
air and space forces Association now um
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
so we have a legislative committee which
 
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
I chair that every year we scrub all of
 
00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:41.079 align:start position:0%
the bills that are going to come before
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature and this this session
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
there's 20 of them uh that we feel have
 
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
better an impact and we take a position
 
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
on that and then I come and I tell you
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
what that position is and I I feel the
 
00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
pain of our our previous uh
 
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
representative who spoke when he talked
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
talked about license plate bills I was
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
certainly here for the uh the transition
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
to from Li from a whole new license
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
plate to cost $64,000 to put in the
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
system to a sticker that you can put on
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh through that controversy and it's the
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's the running joke of our committee
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
some of you of a certain age may
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
remember the so kung kung fu with David
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
kerine at the beginning the old man says
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
when you can take the pebble from my
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
hand grasshopper it'll be time to leave
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
the standing joke is when I can get a
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
legislative session without a license
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
plate Bill it'll be time for somebody
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
else to be the share um this bill has
 
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
come up before and our veterans have
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
really been kind of hard over about the
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
position that you know the veteran plate
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
is for the veteran and this time I asked
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
them I said is it possible that our
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
position has mellowed on this and I also
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
told them that when I come and talk to
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
committees the thing that I want to
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
leave them with because I don't want
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
every time you see me I've got my hand
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
out looking for money I want to leave
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
you with the idea that that if one of us
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
serves the whole family serves okay so
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
it those people that are our family
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
members endure a lot of sacrifices so
 
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
that we can do what we do and keep you
 
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
safe and as we were discussing this bill
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
um we had a very impassioned plea from
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
one of our female members of the
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
committee that said you know the bottom
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
line here is that the military does so
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
little for surviving spouses that a
 
00:41:27.069 --> 00:41:27.079 align:start position:0%
license plate is a really pretty small
 
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
price to pay to continue that Legacy and
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
and that really did win the day it
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't a unanimous decision it was like
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
14-6 but I'm here to tell you that that
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
we we do support this bill now we think
 
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
it does good things for visibility
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
whenever we see have visibility for
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
veterans it it helps us out to
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative Hills question it costs
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
$4 to get a veteran plate and every year
 
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
the person has to pay the standard uh
 
00:41:57.309 --> 00:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
bills to the St State and property taxes
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff that go along with
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
registering that plate so the difference
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
in cash on this thing would be the
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
difference what would be the whatever
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
we're currently charging for a plates
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
maybe 12 bucks I don't know I'm not I'm
 
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
not the expert on exactly what that is
 
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
but if we made the surviving spouse
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
change to that then that's uh what we
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
would what we'd
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
have um I had a question I had an answer
 
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
to representative Rambo's question but I
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
can't remember it off the top of my head
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
the question that you asked ma'am I
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
believe it's about to oh did you have a
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry are you are you all
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
set yes I'm subject to your questions
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
then I'll I'll I'll I'll stop now and
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
and entertain questions thank you sir
 
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.630 align:start position:0%
and entertain questions thank you sir
representative

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
bro thank you for taking my question the
 
00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079 align:start position:0%
Clause regarding the surviving uh
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
remarrying The Sur yes I think that
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's put in there because it's fairly
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
consistent with what the military does
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of surviving spouse for example
 
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
you you're your let's say my wife for
 
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
example I've been in I was in for 25
 
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
years we have healthc care through the
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
military through Tri care okay if if we
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
were to get divorced or I if I was to
 
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
die then she would um actually not
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
divorced but if I was to die she would
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
keep that health care until such time as
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
she remarried so there are a lot of the
 
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
the handful of benefits that a surviving
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
spouse keeps when when the the the
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
member dies
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
that that language is consistent with
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
with what you would find in the federal
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
statutes on that that's helpful thank
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none I
 
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
feel much better I do remember uh I
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
thought I remembered that when this bill
 
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
first came out years the law that your
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
position was for the year so to see that
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
change makes all the difference for me
 
00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
um in terms of your other statement too
 
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:51.640 align:start position:0%
looks like I'm probably going to be safe
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
here for a while too representative Hill
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you take
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
my question um I had a veteran spouse
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
say to me the other day and I'm
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if I can get your comment on
 
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
her comment she said um when I lost my
 
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
husband every single tie um that I had
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
with with him has been severed except
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
for the plate at this point and I know
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
I've only got a year to have this plate
 
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
but that will be the last thing that I
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
have that that is a reminder of that
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
does that sound well I I I hope that the
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
whatever member organizations that and
 
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
and most of us veterans are members of
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
at least one or two veteran service
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
organizations I would hope that the
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
members of that group would reach out to
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
that surviving spouse and and and try
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
and provide that that continuity perhaps
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
the spouses of the people that are in
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
those organizations would reach out as
 
00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
well I know we do in in a a veterans
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
organization I have called the dallion
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
that is a society of of military Pilots
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
that we we pay for ground and flight
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
instructions for kids during the summer
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
to learn how to solo an airplane you
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
know we reach out we've got six or seven
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
surviving spouses that are are still get
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
invitations to all of our meetings and
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
dinners and those kind of things I would
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
hope that that happens but what you're
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
describing is pretty much exactly to to
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo's question it's
 
00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
pretty much exactly the way it is you
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
everything pretty much goes away once
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
that that military that veteran passes
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
away every everything that you used to
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
have kind of goes away thank
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
you right seeing no other questions
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh I have
 
00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:38.119 align:start position:0%

Bill 1354 so I'll close the public
 
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
hearing I give us a few minutes might be
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:51:40.430 align:start position:0%
 
1416

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%

okay I'm going to open up the public
 
00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1416 FN relative
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
to prohibiting parking of non-electric
 
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles in spaces designated for
 
00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
charging electric
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%

Richmond which is chure
 
00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:40.839 align:start position:0%
10 um here to introduce HB
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
1416 it's a bill that would create a
 
00:52:46.829 --> 00:52:46.839 align:start position:0%
fine for parking in a space that's
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
reserved for electric vehicles while
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
charging uh it would be a $100
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
fine uh and it has an enforcement
 
00:52:58.349 --> 00:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism that's similar to what we now
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
have for handicap spaces that is a uh an
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
owner of a of the
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
facility or the owner driver of a car of
 
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
electric car that needs to use the space
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
or wants to use the space uh can submit
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
an affidavit and photographic evidence
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
that there's a an improper vehicle
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
parked in a uh electric vehicle charging
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
space uh to the local law enforcement
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
Authority and they would issue the
 
00:53:24.319 --> 00:53:27.309 align:start position:0%
Authority and they would issue the
ticket

00:53:27.309 --> 00:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:31.799 align:start position:0%
um why why do we submit this uh bring is
 
00:53:34.109 --> 00:53:34.119 align:start position:0%
a very significant public and private
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
investment in these charging facilities
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
the the level so-called level three
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
charging facilities can run tens of
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars per
 
00:53:46.109 --> 00:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
stall uh this paid through by a
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
combination of private and public
 
00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
investment or public subsidies for these
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
and significant private investment and
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
if somebody is taking up a space and
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh that could otherwise be producing
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
Revenue it's really a
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
u a serious matter that U you know
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
affects the ability of people to to put
 
00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:08.799 align:start position:0%
this Services out
 
00:54:08.799 --> 00:54:10.950 align:start position:0%
this Services out
there

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
um you know the availability of charging
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
public charging stations is one of the
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
major issues in
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
the facing the adoption of electric
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh Nationwide worldwide really
 
00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
uh you can see the difference in sorry
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
terms of what the Tesla has done in
 
00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
terms of providing spaces versus U you
 
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
know as a as a lead that this was one of
 
00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
the first things that they did in order
 
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
to ensure that that they could
 
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
successfully enter and dominate this
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
Market um the problem with enforcement
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
is also a disincentive to owners I me uh
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
shopping mall owners uh hotels
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:56.309 align:start position:0%
shopping mall owners uh hotels
restaurants

00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
other uh venues that would might benefit
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
by attracting uh drivers that drivers of
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles if they could provide
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
the space I somebody's coming up from
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
New York wants to stay at a local
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
hotel you know they can get here on the
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
the range they they started with but
 
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
they need to plug in overnight in order
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
to get home so there are Travelers who
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
do seek out hotels that offer these
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
charging facilities and
 
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
if if the hotels or other venues can't
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
do anything about people parked
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
illegally then it's a disincentive to
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
provide that service and we lose
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
potential revenue from outstate
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
Travelers um just in terms of who uses
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
these things uh Nationwide 82% of all
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charging is done at
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
home another 10% is done at work or
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
Fleet charging so we're talking about
 
00:55:58.029 --> 00:55:58.039 align:start position:0%
something on the order of 8% of of
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
charging that's done in these public
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
stations either level two or level three
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh and you know these are people who are
 
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
you know not local residents be you know
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
because mostly in this state in
 
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
particular they people charge at home
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
but people driving in from
 
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
elsewhere who use these facilities and
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
rely on these facilities in order to
 
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
plan a trip and if they can't find a
 
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
place to charge then they go elsewhere
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a it's a public issue to
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
the to the
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
state um in terms of our ability to
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
attract tourists attract visitors
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
attract business uh
 
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
users uh and so it's not just a you know
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
a private theft of services problem it's
 
00:56:45.789 --> 00:56:45.799 align:start position:0%
a it's a public problem as well so that
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
is the reason why I thought this bill
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
it good morning rep
 
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives as a long-term selectman
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
and School Board member whenever I have
 
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
had to somebody comes up with an idea
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
I've always said who does it help and
 
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
who does it
 
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
hurt so who does this bill hurt well
 
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.230 align:start position:0%
hurt so who does this bill hurt well
rude

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
rude
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
people um that's who it hurts and uh it
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
who does it help and as a small business
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
owner it helps me and I'll tell you why
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh in the town where I live
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
which is on the route between the city
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
of Keane and the City of
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
Boston um I happen to own a laundromat
 
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
which has an excellent opportunity for a
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
Tesla charging station the franchise on
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
each Tesla charging station one post one
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
gas pump is
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
$55,000 that's before I hire the
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
electrician to install it and before I
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
buy the equipment so any small business
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
owner that makes that investment is
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
making a substantial
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
investment and to not be able to have
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
that space accessed by my potential
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
customers which there would be a
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
significant number of driving from
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
Boston to Keane or big numbers by
 
00:58:15.069 --> 00:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
chesher County standards you know um
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
would be damaging to me as a small
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
business owner and really it goes back
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
to who did it benefit parking there
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
people who were being rude people who
 
00:58:26.029 --> 00:58:26.039 align:start position:0%
were trying to make a statement against
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles I own a lot of cars I
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
own an electric car electric cars are
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
here to
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
stay um I can tell you that there are
 
00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
anti-electric car activists if that is
 
00:58:43.029 --> 00:58:43.039 align:start position:0%
in the city of keen behind uh the
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
Colonial Theater we had two charging
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
stations that were installed by the city
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
and that is one place where people would
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
park to make a statement and block
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
people from charging and there was uh
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
actually one someone took bolt cutters
 
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
and cut off the uh whatever you call it
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
the extension cord that you plug your
 
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
car into so it hurts those people who
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
are out going out of their way to make a
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
statement uh that you shouldn't be able
 
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:15.039 align:start position:0%
to drive an electric car I think this is
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
a very straightforward and very simple
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill and I I hope that we can have uh
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
Barry and I Barry is a Democrat I'm a
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
Republican and I hope that we can have a
 
00:59:28.109 --> 00:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward and bipartisan
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
positive decision on this coming out of
 
00:59:33.029 --> 00:59:33.039 align:start position:0%
committee thank you thank you questions
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
from the committee I saw representative
 
00:59:35.839 --> 00:59:39.109 align:start position:0%
from the committee I saw representative
Jones

00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
you representatives for being here um I
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
see this bill as you're staying with the
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
changing of times and you're being
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
proactive instead of reactive and I know
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
you want a question Mr chair so yes so
 
00:59:57.549 --> 00:59:57.559 align:start position:0%
uh here it comes
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
um instead of this be is it better for
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
this to become an R Statewide RSA or to
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
have allow the municipalities to create
 
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:09.400 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
ordinances my answer to that is it
 
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
really needs to be a Statewide lot uh
 
01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:17.559 align:start position:0%
small towns would not have the ability
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
effectively to the town of Troy is about
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
2100 people the town of Fitz William is
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
a similar number it would be difficult
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
with all the other things that Selectmen
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
have to deal with and town meeting has
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
to deal with that we would ever get to
 
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
this but it's just as real a problem
 
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
there as it would be in the city of
 
01:00:38.589 --> 01:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
Kean can I add to
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
that uh most if not well many if not
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
most of the U public charging stations
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
are on private
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
property and uh you need to have a
 
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
Statewide law that pertains to that
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
because municipalities just
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
would not have the authority to regulate
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
use of private property for this purpose
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
without the state law thank
 
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair yep
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
question um you say that this is uh only
 
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
hurting rude people um but I'd like to
 
01:01:22.109 --> 01:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
ask about line 10 of the bill um where
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
it says that uh the owner of the
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
non-electric vehicle that violates is is
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
punished um what if the owner of that
 
01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:35.799 align:start position:0%
vehicle has no idea that their child or
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
vehicle well as the former father of
 
01:01:44.039 --> 01:01:45.309 align:start position:0%
vehicle well as the former father of
three

01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:45.319 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
teenagers and owner of the vehicles that
 
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.789 align:start position:0%
teenagers and owner of the vehicles that
they

01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
drove I would say that there are a lot
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
of things that uh the owners of a
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle are responsible for whether I
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
was driving it or not so that's my
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
answer right that's the same as other
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
parking regulations right now that the
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
fine goes to the
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
owner uh this parallels exactly with the
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism of the handicap
 
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
parking spaces for example so the owner
 
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
is responsible for whoever is driving
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
the vehicle and you know a few mons to
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
go and charge his teenage son
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
the $100 he's up to that but it's the
 
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
owner that is responsible for the whole
 
01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
whole list of parking and other
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
violations that uh occur when the when
 
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
there's nobody actually driving the
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle follow thank you
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle that happens all the time now
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
too so the rental companies if they get
 
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
a a ticket in the mail they they charge
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions any other
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair thank you how
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
how often uh when somebody parks in one
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
of these spots electric is it is it
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
running into a store or is it somebody
 
01:03:15.069 --> 01:03:15.079 align:start position:0%
that's parking there for several hours
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
and yeah no
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
I a lot of
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
occasionally right now uh because the
 
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
market these things tend to be put out
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
in the Far
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
Corners you know they sort of relegate
 
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
these the EVS to the sort of less
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
desirable spaces of when Walmarts in
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
particular put them out at the edge um
 
01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:40.359 align:start position:0%
and one of the disincentives for putting
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
in close to the store is that you know
 
01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:43.670 align:start position:0%
in close to the store is that you know
the

01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
people will will will park in them even
 
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
if they're not charging uh I did observe
 
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
a supermarket in this one just over the
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
Border in Maine where they did have the
 
01:03:57.549 --> 01:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
EV charging spaces in a very convenient
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
location and they are
 
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
routinely parked in by people who say
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know this is the best space
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
available I'm taking it I don't
 
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
care further questions representative
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
for the uh taking my question uh why the
 
01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
$100 charges why not two three
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
four yeah I think that
 
01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
uh I think we want to say that this is
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
less critical to the
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
to the needs of the public than
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
preventing handicap spaces from being
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
taken so I thought that it should be a
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
lower fine I think $100 is enough
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
to you know send a message but we don't
 
01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
want to say that gez that you know this
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
is the same thing or as as serious an
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
issue as keeping a person with handicap
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
parking follow up actually it's another
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you Mr chair
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
uh these signs would be actually put on
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
private property uh so who who's paying
 
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
for the signs so it would be up to the
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
if it's on private property then they
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
they're they're providing the space of
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
providing the Chargers if they want to
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
be able to have people enforce this law
 
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
or want to enforce themselves they need
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
to put the sign up or have
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
a you know many of these charging
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
stations are logoed so they they they do
 
01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:23.799 align:start position:0%
the same thing so yeah whoever builds
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
the would put the sign up pay for
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
it representative Hill thanks Mr
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
chair um are are people that part that
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
have EVS are people um Allowed by this
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
bill to park in that that spot even if
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
charging the answer is
 
01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
no the only difference is that it may be
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to enforce if they're I mean
 
01:05:57.269 --> 01:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
if they're parked in the space and
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
there's no cord plugged into them then
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
that's going to be pretty obvious and
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
you will do a photographic evidence of
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
that if they're sitting there and they
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
just you know the the charge was
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
completed at 11 o'clock and they're
 
01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
still there at noon time it's going to
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
be kind of hard to prove that I don't
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
think that that's the biggest problem
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
because if you're once you're plugged in
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
they know you're there and they start
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
charging for idle time after a certain
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
period so the charging companies
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
themselves you know Tesla or whoever
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
have figured this out and they they they
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
add on idol fees to keep people
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
moving thank you yep representative St
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
Clair still have a question I do thank
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
you is it is it not possible for the
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
property owners private or even
 
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities to put up a sign that
 
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
says toezone for violators and then have
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
their vehicles tow well that is the
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
current solution one that I think many
 
01:06:57.150 --> 01:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
property owners are reant to take and
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
you know I know the people that do this
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
deliberately as a political statement or
 
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
other statement you know basically wait
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
around and they see the tow truck show
 
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
up they just move the move the vehicle
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
and avoid it so it's not very effective
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
and it's bad public relations I think to
 
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.510 align:start position:0%
and it's bad public relations I think to
people

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
really I don't
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
know as a owner of retail space with
 
01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.430 align:start position:0%
know as a owner of retail space with
parking

01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
parking
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
lots you
 
01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.309 align:start position:0%
lots you
really

01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
are the last thing you want to do is
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
call the toe guy and have somebody's car
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
towed it just you can do it it's legal
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
at the C A Certain frustration level as
 
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
a property owner you do do that but I
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
can tell you in 35 years as a property
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
owner and manager I have had to do it
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
perhaps five times
 
01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
and each time it they were egregious
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
offenders thank
 
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
you I I have a question I I see it's a
 
01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:03.430 align:start position:0%
you I I have a question I I see it's a
new

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
section uh are there any other parking
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
situations where the public actually can
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
participate with testimony and
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
photographs uh even with the handicap I
 
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
don't remember that being the
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
case so this this language about having
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
owners of drivers being able to report
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
is exactly the same language as we now
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
have for handicap spaces many of which
 
01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
are on private space private private
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
parking lots so it's it's the same
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
mechanism I think that's the only one
 
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
where we have exactly that same
 
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism but this is
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
a deliberately attempt to be a parallel
 
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.550 align:start position:0%
a deliberately attempt to be a parallel
process

01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:08:52.349 --> 01:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
um to that so it's you know that that's
 
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
been out there I think
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
I would guess that that's been very
 
01:08:58.749 --> 01:08:58.759 align:start position:0%
effective in terms of providing a
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
disincentive for non non-handicapped
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
Vehicles any other questions from the
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
you representative Gorski thank you Mr
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you both for taking my
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
question how often is this kind of thing
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
happening are you seeing it's like
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
happening once a day twice a day can you
 
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
give us a sense of in your research how
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
often is this
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
happening well my answer to that is it's
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem tell it's a problem
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
but when it's a problem it's a real
 
01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
problem because if you're the guy who
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
just ran out of a charge and somebody is
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
parked in that space with their uh
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
diesel powered
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
F350 uh and they they're not coming back
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
anytime soon you're out of
 
01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
luck so uh that's the that's the problem
 
01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
it's just like how often was the problem
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
with handicap spaces a problem until we
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
started recognizing that as
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
a as a real thing that we need to deal
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
with I would say that
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
um you sort of looking at people's
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
reports people reporting on EV forums
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
and things like that it does happen with
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
some frequency perhaps given all the
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
number of spaces perhaps not you know
 
01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
not all the time but it is a
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
um it's sort of a signal that uh
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know the states where I think it's
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
the worst of like Texas where they you
 
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
know are openly hostile to
 
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.149 align:start position:0%
know are openly hostile to
Eves

01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
Eves
 
01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
um and in California where there are so
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
many EVS that they do you know that the
 
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
spaces fill up all the time and so when
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
it happens people you know post it said
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
this is an outrage and I think that it
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
it it contributes to the U overall image
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
of of this state in terms of its will
 
01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.189 align:start position:0%
of of this state in terms of its will
willingness

01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
willingness
 
01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
to um to provide for you know the
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
citizens who have
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
EVS uh and I and I know New Hampshire's
 
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
way behind I I understand we just lost
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
a an application for funding assistance
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
for uh environmental for Ev um charging
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
stations because lack of infrastructure
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
to to provide and enforce these things
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
so it's uh we got a long way to go this
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
is sort of one small step but all these
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
things kind of contribute to what how
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
people feel about their you know comfort
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles representative
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
ve thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question is this a you know
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
also somebody's business as well is this
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
similar to somebody take parking at a at
 
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
a gas pump and taking up the space at
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
the pump and you know the the retailer
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
who owns that pump is no longer get
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
getting Revenue because somebody's
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
blocking access I I would I I had
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
actually thought of using that analogy
 
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
thing right and um there are two models
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
one I mean there are several National
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
organizations on Tesla for one you know
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
charge point a few others who have their
 
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
own National networks mainly on the
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
interstates uh but most of these things
 
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
most of these public stations are owned
 
01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.070 align:start position:0%
most of these public stations are owned
and

01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
with you know where the owner keeps the
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
revenue and pays the you know electric
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
utility company and somebody else for
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
the software but that you know that's a
 
01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
direct bottom line item for the for the
 
01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.070 align:start position:0%
direct bottom line item for the for the
local

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
business yeah it if I install a Tesla
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
charging station at my facility in Troy
 
01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
it is a $55,000 upfront franchise fee I
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
install the equipment I pay for the
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
electricity and I pay a royalty back to
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:58.510 align:start position:0%
electricity and I pay a royalty back to
Tesla

01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate we're here I'll ask one
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
last question um do you think the
 
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
hostility towards the electric vehicles
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
and the parking St parking spots might
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
have something to do with the federal
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
government forcing people to take part
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
in this absolutely thank you nobody's
 
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
required to buy one
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
is are required to to offer them that's
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
right seeing no other questions thank
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
um next up Michael Fitzpatrick
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services not
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
taking a position on the bill according
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
to this looking for three
 
01:13:35.679 --> 01:13:40.270 align:start position:0%
to this looking for three
minutes

01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
welcome morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
committee Mike Fitzgerald I'm the
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the uh air
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
Resources Division at the Department of
 
01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and my testimony
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
on this bill and the following bill will
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
be be very similar as was noted we are
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
not taking a position this bill in
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
particular is not a major environmental
 
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
issue um however we do uh our
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
agency um administers the Volkswagen
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
trust uh fund and uh diesel emission
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
reduction act funds both of which allow
 
01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
for um some use of those funds to to be
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
used for um uh electric vehicle
 
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and uh we also conven
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
a group of state agencies who have
 
01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
interest in um providing electric
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle infrastructure and promoting EVS
 
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
for environmental and other reasons um
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
and uh again we're not taking a
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
particular position on but um we do
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
certainly think this is a valid concept
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
of of uh you know these spaces are
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
allocated for charging and as was noted
 
01:14:49.629 --> 01:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
very similar to uh gasoline vehicles but
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
um I would also note that there are two
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh bills this session
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
there there are a number of bills
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
relative to electric vehicles in a
 
01:14:59.790 --> 01:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
number of committees and there are two
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
bills this session one in the house and
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
one in the Senate that would create
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
commissions to uh study issues relative
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
to electric vehicles I don't know you
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
know both of those seem to be moving
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
forward I obviously I assume only one
 
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately will um uh be be passed but
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
um we we think that um certainly uh
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
bills that are related to electric
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles um it might be worth seeing uh
 
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
these commissions come through and and
 
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
allow them to study these issues and
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
make recommendations um again this one
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
seems you know certainly uh positive but
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh the following Bill we we would have
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
the F the same similar testimony that um
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
that these study commissions might be
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles for better understanding these
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
issues uh so with that I will uh I'll
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
stop and I may expand upon it a little
 
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
bit in the following bill but um I'd be
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions or wait till
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
afterwards thank you sir any questions
 
01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
much I have nobody else signed up to
 
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
speak on House Bill 1416 so I'll close
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
hearing uh give us just a couple of
 
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
minutes to reset and we'll be taking up
 
01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:22.110 align:start position:0%
minutes to reset and we'll be taking up
1332

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:17:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
next

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:20.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open up the public
 
01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
hearing on host Bill 1332 FN relative to
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
prohibiting electric vehicles from
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
parking and parking
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
garages and I did it again chair
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prime sponsor for
 
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
back good morning again chairman and the
 
01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee today I I'm
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
bringing a bill to prohibit electric
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
cars parking and parking garages and no
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not one of those people that he just
 
01:18:56.669 --> 01:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
talked about that are making a statement
 
01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
against electric vehicles if you want to
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
own one knock your socks off right but
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here on the safety aspect right I've
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
been a firefighter for over 40 years and
 
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
that's Public Safety is what I do and
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
and look out for
 
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
so couple of concerns the first one a
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
regular F-150 pickup truck weighs
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 4,500 lb let's give or
 
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
take the lightning electric pickup truck
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
same size as the F-150 weighs over 7,000
 
01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.030 align:start position:0%
same size as the F-150 weighs over 7,000
pounds

01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
pounds
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
right so a lot of these electric cars
 
01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
counterparts the some of these garages
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
were not designed to hold that way they
 
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
look at an average car they and I'm sure
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
the state's engineer here over here we
 
01:19:56.629 --> 01:19:56.639 align:start position:0%
can attest to that and maybe I'm wrong
 
01:19:58.590 --> 01:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
on that but I know that New York City
 
01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:01.239 align:start position:0%
has had one garage already collaps due
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
to electric
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
cars over stressing the
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
garage the other piece of that is that
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
carf fires burn at least twice as hot
 
01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
close to 2,800 degrees when they're
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
burning and they reach that fairly
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
quickly you're now going to start
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
weakening the the concrete and the metal
 
01:20:24.159 --> 01:20:27.470 align:start position:0%
weakening the the concrete and the metal
underneath

01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
it so it used to and now you're looking
 
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
at a vehicle on the side of the road as
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to an electric vehicle burning
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
in a garage when it's burning on the
 
01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:41.639 align:start position:0%
side of the road what used to take us
 
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
one fire Tru and maybe a th
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
gallons maybe now is taking us the first
 
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
alarm assignment two engines a ladder a
 
01:20:55.629 --> 01:20:55.639 align:start position:0%
couple of tankers a lot of tankers
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
because we used to take us a th000
 
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
gallons now it takes us 30 to 40,000
 
01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
gallons because we have to cool this
 
01:21:05.229 --> 01:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle off until it stops burning and
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
hopefully it stays stops burning but it
 
01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
tends to reignite as soon as it starts
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
warming back up so we've seen an average
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
of people of the fire department dealing
 
01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:19.639 align:start position:0%
with these for at least three
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
hours now you put that in a garage next
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
to other vehicles that are probably
 
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
going to light off as well and if it's
 
01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:29.719 align:start position:0%
another electric vehicle on either side
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
of it we really have an issue and and
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
be a major incident on a on a car fire
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
the other piece of that is that when
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
these burn they give off deadly gases
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
hydrogen volatile organic uh compounds
 
01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.229 align:start position:0%
hydrogen volatile organic uh compounds
CO2

01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
CO2
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
methane and I know you don't think it's
 
01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
kind of an enclosed space but it is
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
right even though there's some air
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
getting in and out of there or if you go
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
down into a basement garage there is
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
none so now you have all these highly
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
toxic gases in a garage space that
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
people are trying to get out of and may
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
not make it it's not just regular smoke
 
01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:14.350 align:start position:0%
not make it it's not just regular smoke
right

01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
um so that's
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
what the reason for me bringing this
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
forward and I'm not the only one um that
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
believes in this that these will become
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
an issue if they are put in a garage and
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
now if you add charging stations in that
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
garage because we know
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
that manufacturers recommend that you
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
trickle charge them which is like an
 
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
overnight charge then there's a standard
 
01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
charge that charges it in a few hours
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
and then the rapid charge that charges
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
it in less than an hour
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
manufacturer doesn't recommend only in
 
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
emergency cases should it be used
 
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
because it degrades the battery and sets
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
it up to
 
01:23:06.639 --> 01:23:08.629 align:start position:0%
it up to
fail

01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
fail
 
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
so and usually they fail while they're
 
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
charging so this is why I bring this and
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
if there's any questions I will try and
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
answer them for
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
much where do we start representative St
 
01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
Clair I saw him
 
01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:29.639 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chair do do we have
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
any uh information history of fires like
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
this in the state that have happened in
 
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
garages not in our state
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
because electric cars are kind of slow
 
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
to catch on here but they are starting
 
01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
to thank you represent
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
rumo thank you Mr chair thank you um my
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
first qu I have a couple of questions if
 
01:23:52.239 --> 01:23:53.030 align:start position:0%
first qu I have a couple of questions if
I

01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
uh my first question to be clear this
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill is not about charging stations in
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
garages correct correct so discussion
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
about whether they're charging in the
 
01:24:03.390 --> 01:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
garage would be dangerous or not sort of
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
secondary right to the question of
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
whether they're allowed in the garage
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay um in terms of the chemical
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
compounds or the toxic compounds that
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
might be released in case of a fire
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
could you tell us a little more about
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
the difference between a EV fire in a
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
garage in terms of what's released you
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
started some references but compared to
 
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
a no organic volatile compounds there
 
01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:30.280 align:start position:0%
may be some
 
01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.070 align:start position:0%
may be some
Co

01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
Co
 
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:35.639 align:start position:0%
um and depending on what's burning in
 
01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
the car but these batteries that's
 
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
what's killing a lot of the people in
 
01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.550 align:start position:0%
what's killing a lot of the people in
these

01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
cars uh when an EV car goes into thermal
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
runaway the Electric System shuts
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
down and the doors are
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
electric you have to find the manual
 
01:24:59.109 --> 01:24:59.119 align:start position:0%
override in your car it's usually a some
 
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
kind of cable that you have to pull to
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
release the door most people don't even
 
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
know that they exist so we're finding
 
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
all of these people in the back of the
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
cars trying to get away from this from
 
01:25:10.239 --> 01:25:11.149 align:start position:0%
cars trying to get away from this from
these

01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
gases some people call it smoke but in
 
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
that smoke is all these gases that are
 
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
killing them before normal smoke would
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
but a park and garage fan is not going
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
to change did you have a followup yes
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
may I please have a followup but a
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
parking garage man is not going to
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
resolve that safety risk or change that
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
for somebody in a car fire it's just one
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
more thing that gets added if the
 
01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle is in a parking garage those
 
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
hazardous gases are there and where you
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
could probably walk through regular
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
smoke you won't walk through these okay
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
one more may I have one more please
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
being way too kind but go ahead one
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
more at the beginning you referenced the
 
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
F-150 being a certain weight and that
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
the EVS we talking are much heavier
 
01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay so is it is the
 
01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
weight the concern here in the rest of
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
so the weight is one of the major
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
concerns so should we be looking at a
 
01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
weight limit for parking garages versus
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
an EV limit or prohibition if you're
 
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about the risk how are you
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
going to do that say that once we hit
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
this certain weight 10 EV come in and
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
take the weight
 
01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
of 20 parking spaces that they can't
 
01:26:29.709 --> 01:26:29.719 align:start position:0%
charge for I think I'm trying to
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
understand we're going back and forth
 
01:26:34.109 --> 01:26:34.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we know how this works
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative Fox thank you Mr chairman
 
01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
so just so I understand um New Hampshire
 
01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
has had no
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
instances in a parking garage that I
 
01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:47.719 align:start position:0%
parking garage at this point and
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in in the fire reporting
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
system there's no check box for electric
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
car that I've seen yet so it comes in as
 
01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
a carire MH could be electric could not
 
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
be follow up Mr chair yep follow up
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any data Nationwide
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
how many we're talking about so New York
 
01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
City has had them and New York City has
 
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
had well that's where they all are right
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
well New York right New York City's not
 
01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
not New Hampshire but but that's where
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
the EVS are parking in parking garages
 
01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
at the moment and and if I had something
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
else I'd be happy to offer it do you but
 
01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
I know they've had one garage collapse
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
already due to
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
EVS thank you yeah if you anything you
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
can find for the committee in terms of
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
statistics would be greatly appreciated
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
I will see what I can do representative
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I know we
 
01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh regulations or or stipulations on on
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
the location of um gasoline filling
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
stations um there my understanding is
 
01:28:06.669 --> 01:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
you can't have them near a assisted
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
living facility and a movie theater and
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
a something like that are you are you
 
01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.270 align:start position:0%
a something like that are you are you
heading

01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
heading
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
to similar types of ordinances some
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
other states have already started with
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
them near near the same operations that
 
01:28:25.709 --> 01:28:25.719 align:start position:0%
that you can't have them in front of
 
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
certain buildings um because if if they
 
01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.590 align:start position:0%
certain buildings um because if if they
let

01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
let
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
go so goes the building right and you
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
don't want something that's G to um tend
 
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
to burn quicker so I know just like they
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
limit gasoline stations they're going to
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
start limiting areas that you can have
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
them follow up yep follow up thank you
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
would would it be advisable to do that
 
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
under the under um individual
 
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
municipality ordinances again almost uh
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
running to representative Jones's
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
question earlier is that something that
 
01:29:11.109 --> 01:29:11.119 align:start position:0%
should be mandated by the state or is
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
that something that should
 
01:29:15.310 --> 01:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
be town and city
 
01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
ordinances I'd like to see it as a state
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
ordinance right so we're all on the
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
thing playing field because you're going
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
to drive into one town you can park
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
there and you go to the next town and
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
you're expecting to park in the parking
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
garage and no that town says no right
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of why we do a lot of
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
things Statewide to keep everything the
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
same so you don't have to have like a a
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
little chart saying well in Manchester I
 
01:29:46.109 --> 01:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
can Nashville I can't conad maybe right
 
01:29:50.109 --> 01:29:50.119 align:start position:0%
we know yes we can or no we can thank
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
you see
 
01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.709 align:start position:0%
you see
representative

01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question um was concerned
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
about the definition of parking garage
 
01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
is this just for municipal garages or is
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
it privately owned like at a shopping
 
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
mall or possibly like some condos uh
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
have uh essentially a
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
snowshed that people park in that might
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
be caused and called a garage even
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
though it doesn't have doors on it
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's a really good
 
01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
question uh I would like to see it for
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
all right because Fire doesn't care
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's private municipal or the
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
condo association but I I get that first
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
floor with a little cover over it to me
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's not really a parking garage I'm
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
talking about a structure that they're
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
elevated or below ground enclosed
 
01:30:49.109 --> 01:30:49.119 align:start position:0%
somewhat right granted you know I know
 
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
the outside ones have some air flowing
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
through but not a whole lot and now it's
 
01:30:59.950 --> 01:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
around representative Jones and we are
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
falling behind
 
01:31:05.709 --> 01:31:05.719 align:start position:0%
folks thank you Mr chairman I'll make
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
this quick
 
01:31:09.550 --> 01:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
um just following the concept that
 
01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
you're going with um the some of the
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
international Freight Carriers there's
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
been issues in the past couple years the
 
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
ones that transport over uh Vehicles
 
01:31:23.470 --> 01:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
overseas they've had fires because of
 
01:31:26.109 --> 01:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
the battery and battery operated
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles and theyve some of those
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
carriers will no longer take any
 
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles I doesn't this go
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
along with the same concept that you
 
01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
were presenting I would say so I I
 
01:31:42.109 --> 01:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
believe I watched a big
 
01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
Toyota carrier ship burn up pretty well
 
01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
and I I was led to believe that that was
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
an electric car that started
 
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.270 align:start position:0%
an electric car that started
that

01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no other questions
 
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you next up
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative fauler
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
who is opposed to the bill looking for
 
01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:07.070 align:start position:0%
who is opposed to the bill looking for
three

01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
minutes want to say that I think this is
 
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
a a bill looking for a problem and then
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
coming up with a solution that's not
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
actually very helpful so I'm just going
 
01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
to put a few facts out there I own a
 
01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.510 align:start position:0%
to put a few facts out there I own a
electric

01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
electric
 
01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
car uh my battery weighs 9 00 lb about
 
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
900 lb
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
additional uh the whole car is under
 
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
3500 so the difference between a pickup
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
truck and a regular car is a lot greater
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
than the difference between
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
a my car with the gas engine and my car
 
01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.709 align:start position:0%
a my car with the gas engine and my car
with

01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:32:42.719 --> 01:32:44.390 align:start position:0%
with
battery

01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
battery
 
01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
basic well I'm going to say that battery
 
01:32:53.229 --> 01:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
fires are pretty rare
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
250,000 bolts have been built 18 battery
 
01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
fires 18 battery fires that were caused
 
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
by a manufacturing defect which has
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
since been corrected and was uh due to a
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
recall supervised by the national

01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
car getting caught in a house fire car
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
being involved in a collision in the
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
highway all sources one Tesla fire for
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
every 205 million vehicle miles traveled
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
you take the rest of the fleet the
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
gasoline powered Fleet it's one vehicle
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
fire for every 19
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
million uh vehicle miles travel
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.030 align:start position:0%
million uh vehicle miles travel
so

01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
regular vehicle fires from all causes
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
all sources and all types 10 times more
 
01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
fires T reports of all these battery of
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
all these uh battery cost fires no
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
confirmed deaths due to the battery fire
 
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
340 some pod people died from gasoline
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle fires last year
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
largely in collisions but but somewhere
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so the problem with fires is
 
01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
not electric
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh electric vehicles are in
 
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
fact a big improvement over the current
 
01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
Fleet uh I just want to point out that
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
when cars first started carrying
 
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
gasoline we had to switch from water
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
only fire suppression to you know foam
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
on most of these uh vehicles uh same
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
thing here that we need to find the
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
right method I understand the current
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
method of choice is to have a a
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
fireproof blanket that you just throw
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
over the vehicle and let it burn you
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
know if the battery is burned then the
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
cars total which is actually true of uh
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
gasoline powered vehicles as well so a
 
01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
misinformation a lot of fear
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
monitering uh you know if there's a fire
 
01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
uh the fire departments need the tools
 
01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
to fight these fires then we should
 
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
provide them but Banning the vehicles
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
isn't going to help
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
um EV sales are
 
01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
growing um worldwide maybe not New
 
01:35:29.229 --> 01:35:29.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we kind a
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
little slice here that's not typical but
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
you know in Norway for example 90% of
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
new cars sold electric vehicles
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
throughout Europe typically 30 35% China
 
01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
35% California 20% I mean there are
 
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a growing number of electric
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles out there they're going to be
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
everywhere uh
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
let's attack this Pro problem rationally
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
and not with fearmongering thank you
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no questions thank you
 
01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:02.590 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no questions thank you

as noted we take no position uh in
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
particular but uh as I noted on the last
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh there are two study commissions
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
that uh L legislation uh to create two
 
01:36:39.149 --> 01:36:39.159 align:start position:0%
study commissions uh currently one in
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
the Senate and one in the house to uh
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
look at barriers to electric vehicle uh
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
introduction into into the marketplace
 
01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
and another one to look at safety issues
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
um and I would note that there are
 
01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
several bills related to EVS uh in this
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
session um last week in the public works
 
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
committee two bills were considered one
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
that was relative to forced Labor uh
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
used in components for electric
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles um and another one that would
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
ban the state from procuring electric
 
01:37:12.109 --> 01:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh both of those bills were
 
01:37:14.910 --> 01:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
found uh one one was uh found itl and
 
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
one was was uh recommended for entum
 
01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
study um we again we convene a a
 
01:37:24.109 --> 01:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
Consortium of uh State agencies that
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
have interest in uh uh EVS from uh
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
several aspects and uh we do fund EV
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
charging um and so our uh thought at
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
this time would be that the committee
 
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
consider um uh holding this potentially
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
holding this forum study uh while these
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
other um study commissions do their work
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh relative to some of the information
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
uh that was requested Ed earlier um the
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshal on Senate Bill 430
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
did testify that to the best of his
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge the information that he could
 
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
gather that New Hampshire has
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
experienced two battery fires two
 
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle battery fires um so far
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
we've have approximately I believe our
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
data shows and from this from
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
DMV um data that we we looked at um that
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
we have approximately 12,000 EVS in the
 
01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
state now that number is certainly
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
increasing relative to weight um the
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
weight issue is really not an electric
 
01:38:26.350 --> 01:38:26.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle issue cars are getting heavier
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
overall um it's between 1980 and 2020
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
the average weight of uh the average
 
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle increased about 1,000 pounds and
 
01:38:37.070 --> 01:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
also uh the number of much larger
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are being purchased today
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
you large EV um uh SUVs and pickup
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
trucks Etc so this is not the weight is
 
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
not really an electric vehicle issue um
 
01:38:50.589 --> 01:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
granted some of them do way more but uh
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
um vehicle Les are just getting bigger
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
heavier and and uh uh increasing in
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
weight overall so um parking garages
 
01:39:01.790 --> 01:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
certainly have to accommodate that as I
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
say just o in that uh 40-year period I
 
01:39:07.629 --> 01:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
noted an increase of 1,000 pounds per
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle um and that was well before EV
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
penetration into the market so again we
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
think these are issues that need to be
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
studied um and uh collect real data not
 
01:39:23.310 --> 01:39:23.320 align:start position:0%
just anecdotal information and um we
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
would certainly ask the the committee
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
think about um um looking at uh interim
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
study while these other commissions can
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
do their work assuming that they move
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
ahead so with that I'd be uh happy to
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
take any
 
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir I'm going to
 
01:39:40.510 --> 01:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
start off with one can you supply the
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
committee with any data uh referring to
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
internal combustion engine Vehicles
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
becoming heavier as as opposed to going
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
the other direction because with Cafe
 
01:39:53.229 --> 01:39:53.239 align:start position:0%
standards and mileage requirements I
 
01:39:56.109 --> 01:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
thought lightweight was the goal for the
 
01:39:58.109 --> 01:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
last couple of decades so can you give
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
me some info yeah yeah well I'll the
 
01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
reference that I I just u i I'll I'll
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
pass that information on to the
 
01:40:06.589 --> 01:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
committee yes thank you sir questions
 
01:40:07.470 --> 01:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee seeing then thank you very
 
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%

01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
I was surprised to hear some of the
 
01:40:57.310 --> 01:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
concerns brought to light from this
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
training and how I think they pertain to
 
01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
this measure uh the electric vehicle
 
01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
fire temperature starts at
 
01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
2800° and the fire size doubles every 15
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
seconds uh in parking garages it would
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
spread to other cars very quickly the
 
01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
fires get so hot they melt tires and
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
asphalt and there's no way to remove
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
these cars from the parking garages
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
a conven well unfortunately uh rep P had
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
my statistic uh Ford F-150 weighs 4500
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
lb the same electric model weighs about
 
01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:34.270 align:start position:0%
lb the same electric model weighs about
7,000

01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
7,000
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
um the smoke from an EV fire is not
 
01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
smoke it's toxic gas consisting of
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
hydrogen voc's CO2 and methane which is
 
01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
toxic to vehicle operators and First
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
Responders there is currently no
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
firefighting protocol to fight these
 
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
fires except to let them burn themselves
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
out when deprived of oxygen as some
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
suggest submerging in water or bur
 
01:42:01.709 --> 01:42:01.719 align:start position:0%
burying them in the ground they reignite
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
when oxygen hits them as long as a month
 
01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:07.719 align:start position:0%
later the temperatures are so hot that
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
First Responders can't get near the fire
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
their gear is rated for just
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
800° thermal Run Runaway is a chain of
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
events that typically starts with the
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
gradual breakdown of EV battery cells
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
causing the preheating of the EV battery
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
cells and the pack the elevated
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
temperature within the EV battery cells
 
01:42:29.709 --> 01:42:29.719 align:start position:0%
causes the organic solvents to break
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
down resulting in the release of gas
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
increased pressure and temperature
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
Beyond its flash point uh fires and EV
 
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
batteries are triggered by uh thermal
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
runaway events um which is a safety
 
01:42:46.109 --> 01:42:46.119 align:start position:0%
hazard in lithium ion batteries and can
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
be caused by short circuiting mechanical
 
01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
stress to the EV battery from an impact
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
during an accident overheating or poor
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
cooling techniques condensation and
 
01:42:59.669 --> 01:42:59.679 align:start position:0%
moisture as we see in Florida with some
 
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
of the uh tropical storms um or a
 
01:43:05.229 --> 01:43:05.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturing defect most protocols now
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
indicate to let the fire burn itself out
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
or to D douse with large amounts of
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
water anywhere from 5,000 to 25,000
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
gallons of
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
water requiring more manpower hours
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
which leaves these fire stations underst
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
staffed while supervised in these
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
problems need to be worked out before
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
they can become mainstream uh please
 
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
vote out to pass on this measure um I
 
01:43:31.709 --> 01:43:31.719 align:start position:0%
also wanted to uh agree with Mark P that
 
01:43:35.229 --> 01:43:35.239 align:start position:0%
I am not anti- EV I just think that we
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
need to work these problems out so thank
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
you for hearing my
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much any
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
01:43:47.589 --> 01:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh with nobody else
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on House Bill 1332
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
hearing uh just a couple of minutes to
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
regroup we'll be going into 1445 and
 
01:43:59.070 --> 01:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
much to my surprise I have 1 2 3 four
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
five six seven 8 nine 10 people um
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak uh I don't normally
 
01:44:08.189 --> 01:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
do this but we will today we are going
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
to be doing time limits of three minutes
 
01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
which is what most of the people are
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
requesting for time so give us a moment
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.599 --> 01:48:06.430 align:start position:0%
 
11

01:48:06.430 --> 01:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
okay welcome back I'm going to open up
 
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 1445
 
01:48:12.589 --> 01:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
which is relative to bicycles electric
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
scooters and electric unicycles and as I
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned as I close the previous
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
hearing I am going to with all these
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
cards go for the three minutes per
 
01:48:26.350 --> 01:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
speaker which is being requested by the
 
01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority so fair enough um
 
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
I will also ask at this time I have
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
eight of them or nine of them that are
 
01:48:37.870 --> 01:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
all opposed uh if you do hear the points
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
that you wanted to bring up uh it's
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
certainly acceptable and okay to wave
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
off speaking if you choose to uh in
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
other words the committee doesn't need
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
to hear the same issues over and over
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
and over so that being said the chair
 
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prim sponsor
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
representative trer good
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
morning good morning Mr chair and
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
members of the transportation committee
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Douglas Traer belnap
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
8 representing the towns of Belmont
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
Tilton and SED today I come before you
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
with House Bill
 
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
1445 since I put this bill in I have
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
learned some information about
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
ebikes um I'm coming before you to
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
request this bill
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
um move forward for the safety of the
 
01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
public that's my goal my goal was not to
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
repeal um some of the current laws I'm
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
looking to add I have learned that some
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
of these class one 23
 
01:49:39.310 --> 01:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
ebikes have some
 
01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
regulations I've learned that there are
 
01:49:46.270 --> 01:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
some new classes out there that that are
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
unclassified are more of the problems
 
01:49:52.350 --> 01:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
that the ones that are doing over um 28
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
miles an hour and the way they're being
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
operated on roadways and also doing some
 
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
further research and speaking to some of
 
01:50:02.430 --> 01:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
the professionals that will probably
 
01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
testify here today also includes
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
electric scooters and the electric
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
unicycles I know recently one of the um
 
01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
unicycles was clocked by a law
 
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in the state at 83
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
miles an hour on radar on a public way
 
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
that is very
 
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous um my concern with the way
 
01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
they're being operated is recklessly and
 
01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
um they're not enforcable by law
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement the way they're written um
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
and another concern there are some
 
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
courts in this state that are taking
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
people's driver's licenses for their
 
01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
poor Behavior which could include
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
driving well impair reckless driving and
 
01:50:48.990 --> 01:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
telling them to purchase an ebike and
 
01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
they haveit still will continue on an
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
electric bike or classified electric
 
01:50:56.910 --> 01:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
bike I understand a lot of people use
 
01:50:58.830 --> 01:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
electric bikes they class one two and
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
three you know for exercise the rail
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
Trails where they're allowed and um
 
01:51:07.149 --> 01:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
certain places like that my goal is not
 
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
to take that away from them but I do
 
01:51:11.149 --> 01:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
have a problem with some of these
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
electrical bikes the way they're being
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
operated you know on sidewalks around
 
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
people cutting and out of vehicles and
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
there's no enforc
 
01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:21.830 align:start position:0%
there's no enforc
um

01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
capability question I have and I I've
 
01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
been asking if I can get an electric
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
bike or something they classify as an
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
electric bike that does 45 miles an hour
 
01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
or faster can I write that down
 
01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:34.709 align:start position:0%
or faster can I write that down
Interstate

01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
Interstate
 
01:51:38.910 --> 01:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
93 because they're not classified as
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
bicycles I mean there are some and
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
depends who you talk to they say they
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
are but what I'm being told they're
 
01:51:51.149 --> 01:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
not um so my goal here is maybe to do an
 
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
amendment change some of this and
 
01:51:55.069 --> 01:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
present it to the
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
committee um clarifying some of this or
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
also I know this house will I believe
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's 14 or 1543 that I believe you're
 
01:52:06.069 --> 01:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
executing later
 
01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:09.719 align:start position:0%
today maybe we can do a interm study
 
01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
between the two bills and come up with
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
something feasible for the safety of the
 
01:52:18.990 --> 01:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
public and not to interfere with the law
 
01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
Biden uses of the electric bikes but
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
again there are
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
unclassified bicycles that are
 
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
electric um that are not assisted by um
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
human um Power so basically they have a
 
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
throttle kind of like a motorcycle and
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to classify these as
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
motorcycles they are a form of a
 
01:52:44.589 --> 01:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
bicycle however some of the speeds are
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
um unreasonable in the way they're being
 
01:52:51.149 --> 01:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
uh operated so that's why I'm before you
 
01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
now is thinking of the safety of the
 
01:52:56.589 --> 01:52:56.599 align:start position:0%
public also if some of these uh
 
01:52:56.599 --> 01:52:58.069 align:start position:0%
public also if some of these uh
electrical

01:52:58.069 --> 01:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
electrical
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
bicycles will use unclassified gets in a
 
01:53:03.149 --> 01:53:03.159 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle accident and does bodily
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
harm to somebody do they technically
 
01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
have to report it to the B motive
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle the way it's written right now I
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
am being told
 
01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
no um so these are concerns to me so um
 
01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm hoping that you'll
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
um let me do an amendment bring that
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
forward addressing more of the detailed
 
01:53:28.270 --> 01:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
concerns after I were um have listen to
 
01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
some of the uh people that deal with
 
01:53:32.669 --> 01:53:32.679 align:start position:0%
these more than I do um to see if we can
 
01:53:34.629 --> 01:53:34.639 align:start position:0%
come up with a better solution if not
 
01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
would ask for an infm study between this
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I believe it's
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
1543 thank
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions from the
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
committee I guess we've gotten the
 
01:53:46.750 --> 01:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
message we know what we know what the
 
01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
goal is seeing then thank you very much
 
01:53:52.109 --> 01:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time consideration
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
have a good
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
recognizes does that say Joan Joan
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
Joan Joan D what's
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm Joan Diario I'm from New
 
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
Market New Hampshire my husband and I
 
01:54:33.550 --> 01:54:33.560 align:start position:0%
have had ebikes for at least three years
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
we ride on rail Trails we ride in bike
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
Lanes um I
 
01:54:43.950 --> 01:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
think the representative who just spoke
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
before is correct in that what really
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
needs to happen is you need to
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
look at electric vehicles in the
 
01:55:00.910 --> 01:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
whole Spectrum there declare them as
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
bicycles or electric vehicles that are
 
01:55:07.229 --> 01:55:07.239 align:start position:0%
not Cars they're not motor
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles um and there should be you know
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
granted some way of uh you know
 
01:55:19.950 --> 01:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
enforcing traffic laws when when we ride
 
01:55:22.990 --> 01:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
we ride in the street we
 
01:55:25.950 --> 01:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
have uh headlights and tail lights we
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
wear helmets we use mirrors we
 
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
signal people who don't do that should
 
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
be pulled over you know I have no
 
01:55:39.629 --> 01:55:39.639 align:start position:0%
problem with that but I do the way that
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
1445 is written they don't want people
 
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
to be on rail trails and bike paths what
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
the heck are we supposed to do most most
 
01:55:52.270 --> 01:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
of the people who ride ebikes are older
 
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
or they have problems riding a regular
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
bike uh because of health issues and at
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
least when they're riding a bike they
 
01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
have a chance to get out in the air or
 
01:56:07.149 --> 01:56:07.159 align:start position:0%
enjoy nature without you know my husband
 
01:56:09.470 --> 01:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
has COPD if he didn't have an ebike he
 
01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:10.629 align:start position:0%
has COPD if he didn't have an ebike he
couldn't

01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
ride um and I will let other people
 
01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
speak up on on what they want to do but
 
01:56:21.069 --> 01:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
I I'm not in favor of this business as
 
01:56:24.189 --> 01:56:24.199 align:start position:0%
written thank you very
 
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
up our chair recognizes Tim Blackman
 
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
representing con conquered Lake sun
 
01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
railro rail trail oppose to the Bill
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
chair there you
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
go um so uh I'm also opposed to the bill
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
um section one is completely unnecessary
 
01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:57.270 align:start position:0%
um section one is completely unnecessary
and

01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
counterproductive um existing law 265
 
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
144a paragraph 7A already allows a city
 
01:57:07.709 --> 01:57:07.719 align:start position:0%
town or state agency having jurisdiction
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
over a bicycle or multi-use path to
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
prohibit the operation of a class one or
 
01:57:15.550 --> 01:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
two electric bicycle on that path um so
 
01:57:17.790 --> 01:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
the proposed uh prohibition of category
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
1 and two ebikes is unnecessary it's
 
01:57:24.669 --> 01:57:24.679 align:start position:0%
already covered um the the legislation
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
is drafted um also came up with a new
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
arbitrary speed of 15 miles an hour
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
which is not supported by industry um or
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
laws written elsewhere around the state
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
so category one and two ebikes um will
 
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
either assist you or help you get to up
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
to 20 miles an hour so introducing an
 
01:57:46.229 --> 01:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
arbitrary 15
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
mph um speed limit is unfor forcible and
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
impractical because that's just not
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
what's being built in the world today
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
um prohibiting category one and two
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
ebikes on multi-use trails and rail
 
01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
Trails is counterproductive to what
 
01:58:06.270 --> 01:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do which is to get more
 
01:58:09.870 --> 01:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
people out on trails and
 
01:58:15.149 --> 01:58:15.159 align:start position:0%
um moving um under their own power um to
 
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
to improve their health and to um help
 
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
reduce carbon emissions so I'm I'm not
 
01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
going to take up any more of your time
 
01:58:25.149 --> 01:58:25.159 align:start position:0%
um thank you written testimony has been
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
handed over thank you very
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
much uh and I apologize next up did you
 
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
have questions any questions from the
 
01:58:37.470 --> 01:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you and I I
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
apologize next up chair recognizes
 
01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:43.950 align:start position:0%
apologize next up chair recognizes
representative

01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
honorable members for the record my name
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
is alen Reed I represent Rockingham 10
 
01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
that's new market and new Fields when I
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
first saw this bill I kind of wondered
 
01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
what in the world problem could this
 
01:58:58.950 --> 01:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
possibly be what could be existing that
 
01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
this needs to to fix um so I have been
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
this may seem weird I've been contacted
 
01:59:08.229 --> 01:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
by more constituents about this opposing
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
this bill than any other bill that we've
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
had before the general court this year
 
01:59:18.030 --> 01:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
um so there is a three class uh
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
classification system that 38 States
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire have already
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
adopted we've already dealt with this
 
01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um and this would treat
 
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
ebikes like motorcycles because as I've
 
01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
testified before you all before I am a
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
motorcycle Enthusiast and like
 
01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
motorcycles ebikes when you're a rider
 
01:59:39.149 --> 01:59:39.159 align:start position:0%
on two wheels you are taking on all of
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
the risk when there is an impact with a
 
01:59:44.189 --> 01:59:44.199 align:start position:0%
motorcycle or especially with an ebike
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
the car wins so to penalize people
 
01:59:51.149 --> 01:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
riding ebikes it is nonsensical
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
um not only as you've already heard are
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
people who ride ebikes people who have
 
01:59:58.270 --> 01:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
physical limitations who wouldn't be
 
02:00:01.629 --> 02:00:01.639 align:start position:0%
able to ride a regular bike they may be
 
02:00:03.870 --> 02:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
elderly or may have other issues and
 
02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:05.639 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do the right thing
 
02:00:08.109 --> 02:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get out outside get
 
02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
some exercise um and this bill would
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
penalize those people but also this bill
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
penalizes other people who are trying to
 
02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
do the right thing and that is people
 
02:00:20.069 --> 02:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
who cannot drive and need an ebike to
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
commute or to do other things they
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
either cannot drive or cannot afford a
 
02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
car so we say that we expect people to
 
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know work their way up and do the
 
02:00:31.470 --> 02:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
right thing and do what it takes to get
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
to work and save money and all of those
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
things but then this bill would penalize
 
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
that so New Market my town has both
 
02:00:41.189 --> 02:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
types of these ebike Riders which is why
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
I've heard so much about this
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
bill um and so I I still am stuck with
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
what in the world problem could be
 
02:00:51.550 --> 02:00:51.560 align:start position:0%
existing in that this is going to fix
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
that it's worth penalizing those two
 
02:00:55.709 --> 02:00:55.719 align:start position:0%
groups of people and with that I'm happy
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
to take questions or just
 
02:01:00.149 --> 02:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
leave thank you very much any questions
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
again uh next up we shall recognize
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
Sylvia leet representing herself opposed
 
02:01:14.830 --> 02:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill welcome uh thank you for allowing
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
me to speak uh I'll make it very brief
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
because I think it's been covered quite
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
well that the class one two and three
 
02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
ebikes are already regulated enough um
 
02:01:31.950 --> 02:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
and I just want to show you my really
 
02:01:35.069 --> 02:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
Doge eared rail trail book I think I've
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of every single rail
 
02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:39.719 align:start position:0%
trail in New Hampshire on my class one
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
ebike and when I I was appalled when I
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
read read this proposed uh legislation
 
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I hope that you will find it
 
02:01:52.030 --> 02:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and finally I
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
will say though that house bill
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
1543 that talks about personal electric
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles the
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
pevs um they are totally different than
 
02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:02.870 align:start position:0%
pevs um they are totally different than
ebikes

02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
ebikes
 
02:02:06.510 --> 02:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
and this bill that you have here today
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
um should be inexpedient to legislate
 
02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:10.390 align:start position:0%
um should be inexpedient to legislate
thank

02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:21.390 --> 02:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
questions next up Richard Anderson
 
02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
representing himself also opposed to the
 
02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:27.109 align:start position:0%
representing himself also opposed to the
bill

02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you very much for having
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
me my wife might me write this all down
 
02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
because I get carried away and I'm going
 
02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:42.679 align:start position:0%
here I speak really fast as a school
 
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
teacher for 33 years so I can do this I
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
think I seldom come to con to speak
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
about pending acts but acts that I have
 
02:02:50.069 --> 02:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
spoken in the
 
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
past I've
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
read proposed to achieve something I
 
02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
have read reread this act and haven't
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
found any purpose in this act at all
 
02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
safety does not seem to be a reason as
 
02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
section one there's a reference to ebike
 
02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
that exceeds 15
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
miles 15 miles an hour but that that
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
does not reference the dangerous road
 
02:03:15.470 --> 02:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
bikes racing Along on rail Trails even
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
faster than that section 1A States a
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
need bike is not to be operated on a
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
bike path or rail trail so why did we
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
invest all this money in bike paths
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
section three notes that manufacturers
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
supp put labels on bikes after January
 
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
1st 2020 what if there isn't a label or
 
02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's not in 6po font if they're applied
 
02:03:40.030 --> 02:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
what does one do ER it's been removed or
 
02:03:42.750 --> 02:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
painted over to make the bike look cool
 
02:03:46.109 --> 02:03:46.119 align:start position:0%
will a DMV local town office or an lbs
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
be responsible for relabeling the frame
 
02:03:50.830 --> 02:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
section four sounds good on the surface
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
but again who's going to be responsible
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
for these labels section six describes
 
02:03:58.830 --> 02:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
class one bike this is an ebike is known
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
as a pedal assy bike where a motor cuts
 
02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
out at 20 M hour when my wife and I
 
02:04:05.790 --> 02:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
bought our ebikes we didn't consider
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
this class bike as it's way safer to
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
cross streets and roads using a throttle
 
02:04:12.030 --> 02:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to start quickly
 
02:04:14.589 --> 02:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
pedaling across this is just another
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
point of how this act is unrealistic
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
about safety section 7 has a whole list
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
of safety features that would be
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
required why aren't these required on
 
02:04:26.910 --> 02:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
lightweight fast road bikes these bikes
 
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
are ridden on both roads and bike trails
 
02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
Road Riders on their skinny Tire
 
02:04:33.870 --> 02:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
lightweight bikes wearing black spandex
 
02:04:35.549 --> 02:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
that makes them blend into the road and
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
surroundings aren't required to show any
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
of these lights but present a real
 
02:04:43.390 --> 02:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
Hazard to drivers section nine makes no
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
sense at all talking about a person
 
02:04:48.270 --> 02:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
riding the back of a class 3 bike the
 
02:04:50.910 --> 02:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
most popular passenger cargo bike in the
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
world is a rad wagon that carry three
 
02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
children and it's a class two bike I
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
really don't think a fall at 25 M an
 
02:05:01.950 --> 02:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
hour off the back of a class 3 bike is
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to do that much worse than a crash
 
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
at 18 mil an hour on a Class 2 bike or
 
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
20 m per hour on a Class one bike that
 
02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
would be for a rider or
 
02:05:14.549 --> 02:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
passenger section 10 brings home that
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
this is not designed to make biking
 
02:05:19.229 --> 02:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
safer as it talks about ebikes ebikes
 
02:05:21.470 --> 02:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
that don't go over 15 M an hour I don't
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
think exist but if they do they need
 
02:05:26.430 --> 02:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
lights whereas lightweight road bikes
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
that go over 20 M an hour on bike trails
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
and Roads don't need any lights I think
 
02:05:32.109 --> 02:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong with this
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
picture so here we are with no purpose
 
02:05:36.589 --> 02:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
for this act in three years of riding
 
02:05:39.149 --> 02:05:39.159 align:start position:0%
rail trails in state and out of state we
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
have never experienced any ebikes
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
passing Folks at excessive speeds or
 
02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
riding in an unsafe manner EXC when my
 
02:05:48.669 --> 02:05:48.679 align:start position:0%
wife and I ride we have always the
 
02:05:50.350 --> 02:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
announce our
 
02:05:52.589 --> 02:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
presence excuse me sir I have to be fair
 
02:05:54.430 --> 02:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
to everybody you've gone over the three
 
02:05:56.910 --> 02:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
if you can wrap it up please the pardon
 
02:05:58.510 --> 02:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
if you can wrap it up I have to be fair
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
I said three for everybody I'm
 
02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:03.069 align:start position:0%
I said three for everybody I'm
sorry

02:06:03.069 --> 02:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh to wrap it up safety is not the
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
consideration of the bills that leav
 
02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
spandex tour to force want to be folks
 
02:06:12.589 --> 02:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
riding trails way past over 20 mil an
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
hour it possibly is the purpose of not
 
02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
bringing any uh tourist of the state um
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
I guess Troopers would be at the border
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
registering these bikes other states are
 
02:06:27.549 --> 02:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
spending millions of dollars on their
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
bike trails so we can go and enjoy
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
riding our ebikes there so I don't know
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a regression I guess
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
not in the
 
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
future if anybody would like a copy of
 
02:06:40.830 --> 02:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
this yeah if you do have copies if you
 
02:06:42.629 --> 02:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
want to distribute them that'd be great
 
02:06:44.589 --> 02:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you have a
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
great day you
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
too uh next up chair recognizes Edward
 
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
Kelly representing the ebike store in
 
02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
bill uh thank you I'll be brief uh I
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
have uh just to be up front here I have
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
two ebike stores uh in uh in New
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have hundreds of clients
 
02:07:14.350 --> 02:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
with ebikes all over the state and I
 
02:07:16.589 --> 02:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
have uh many people from out of state
 
02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
come to my store to rent the bikes ride
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
on the rail Trails everybody gets this
 
02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
quick guide to Safe cycling which goes
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
over all the safety regulations
 
02:07:31.950 --> 02:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh pertaining to the safe operation of
 
02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
bicycles in general but particularly
 
02:07:37.069 --> 02:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
ebikes uh we always emphasize that you
 
02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
obey all traffic laws like any other
 
02:07:42.990 --> 02:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle riding on the road with cars
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
trucks uh motorcycles anything uh we
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
don't ride on sidewalks preferably we
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
ride in uh bike lanes and on rail Trails
 
02:07:55.629 --> 02:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
so again I would just like to uh
 
02:07:58.350 --> 02:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
reiterate what the previous uh speakers
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
have said about uh about the bill uh I'd
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions you might
 
02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
have otherwise I'm done thank you any
 
02:08:08.669 --> 02:08:08.679 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
thanks ah next up sh recognizes David

Trails Coalition who is in opposition to
 
02:08:18.119 --> 02:08:21.790 align:start position:0%
Trails Coalition who is in opposition to
the

02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
welcome morning Mr chair members of the

committee for the record Dave top him
 
02:08:29.549 --> 02:08:29.559 align:start position:0%
from Salem and for a quick flashback and
 
02:08:31.709 --> 02:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
intro I'm also the president of the New
 
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rail Trails Coalition you'll
 
02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
be hearing before long from Paul vad
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
who's with the bike walk Alliance I'm
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
talking about the legislation in front
 
02:08:41.549 --> 02:08:41.559 align:start position:0%
of us now
 
02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
1445 in a quick flashback I was highly
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
involved with the current legislation
 
02:08:49.229 --> 02:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
that make class 123 three bikes legal
 
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
here in the state back in 2019 I was
 
02:08:54.589 --> 02:08:54.599 align:start position:0%
working primarily with uh Earl Sweeney
 
02:08:56.109 --> 02:08:56.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety he was very
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
instrumental and we formulated that to
 
02:08:59.790 --> 02:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
come up with the plan that's in place
 
02:09:02.310 --> 02:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
today as mentioned before we have 38
 
02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
states around the country with this mod
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
legislation we do not see any reason to
 
02:09:09.149 --> 02:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
change what's in place with the
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines we have for that today you
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
folks would have had received this
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
particular handout back on January 9th
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
when I testified in favor of
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
1543 so moving ahead I'll just say
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
that I also full disclosure yesterday
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
morning I had a very pleasant chat for
 
02:09:31.549 --> 02:09:31.559 align:start position:0%
an hour and 10 minutes over Zoom with uh
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Doug tro we agree on
 
02:09:37.229 --> 02:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
intent that we want to keep the public
 
02:09:40.030 --> 02:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
safe we don't want these outer class
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
Vehicles I'm not talking class one two
 
02:09:43.470 --> 02:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
three they're covered I'm talking these
 
02:09:45.629 --> 02:09:45.639 align:start position:0%
devices that can go 40 50 miles an hour
 
02:09:47.709 --> 02:09:47.719 align:start position:0%
with the push of a button that's showing
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
up more and more places and there are
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
more of these vehicles showing up now
 
02:09:53.790 --> 02:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the country than the total
 
02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
sales of electric cars and trucks if you
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
haven't seen them in New Hampshire you
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
will soon so bottom line again I can a
 
02:10:05.310 --> 02:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
chat with a representative TR yesterday
 
02:10:08.669 --> 02:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
we feel the current bill 1445 needs some
 
02:10:11.229 --> 02:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
work I would definitely entertain us
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
working together to come up with things
 
02:10:15.549 --> 02:10:15.559 align:start position:0%
that work and what don't work
 
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
collectively along with the 1540 three
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
that go going to exec this
 
02:10:24.189 --> 02:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
afternoon but hand in hand we say safety
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
safety safety and safety of the public
 
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
there's nothing safe and you get people
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
who don't know what they're doing they
 
02:10:32.589 --> 02:10:32.599 align:start position:0%
get on vehicles that they can't control
 
02:10:34.549 --> 02:10:34.559 align:start position:0%
and whether you want to call these outer
 
02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
class Vehicles motor motor vehicles are
 
02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
not that's up for the legislature to
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
determined I say anything that has the
 
02:10:45.709 --> 02:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
power and speed of Motor Vehicles that
 
02:10:48.669 --> 02:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
we have to register today with licenses
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
registrations everything in place you
 
02:10:53.629 --> 02:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
have the same exact scheme we have
 
02:10:56.109 --> 02:10:56.119 align:start position:0%
something I think we need to control
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's all I have take any questions
 
02:11:00.149 --> 02:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from thank
 
02:11:02.910 --> 02:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
you for your time seeing none thank you
 
02:11:06.189 --> 02:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
again uh next up J recognizes Paula Bard

representing bike walk Alliance of New
 
02:11:10.189 --> 02:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire opposed to the bill with
 
02:11:14.189 --> 02:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
written testimony fantastic welcome yep
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here my name is Paula
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
Bard um I represent the bike walk
 
02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:20.360 align:start position:0%

biking and walking advocacy organization
 
02:11:25.629 --> 02:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
um I also serve on the New Hampshire
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
Traffic Safety commission as the voice
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
for bicyclists and pedestrians in our
 
02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
traffic system uh and as you may know
 
02:11:33.069 --> 02:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
people do use bicycles for both
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
Transportation Recreation and exercise
 
02:11:37.629 --> 02:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
um and some people use bicycle as a
 
02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
primary means of transportation either
 
02:11:43.149 --> 02:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
by choice or by necessity we do opposed
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
1445 as written for the following
 
02:11:47.549 --> 02:11:47.559 align:start position:0%
reasons um this bill currently
 
02:11:49.709 --> 02:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
improperly uh restricts the rights of
 
02:11:52.030 --> 02:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
class one class 2 class three uh it
 
02:11:54.990 --> 02:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
lumps all classes of electric uh bikes
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
together which is not appropriate
 
02:11:59.109 --> 02:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
there's really uh you know this outof
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
class or higher powerered set of
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
electric uh bicycle like vehicles that
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
really need to be regulated differently
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
and separately uh without restricting uh
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
or changing the existing state
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
regulations on class one class two and
 
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
class three bicycles which we the bike
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
walk Alliance of New Hampshire and New
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rail Trails Coalition helped
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
put in place back in
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
2019 um ebikes are uh you know
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
regulation on ebikes is currently
 
02:12:30.589 --> 02:12:30.599 align:start position:0%
available in signage U many
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities have gone to Great
 
02:12:35.629 --> 02:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
Lengths to update signage and policy
 
02:12:37.750 --> 02:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
based on the current guidelines allowing
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
class one and class two on rail Trails
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
by default um this you know 1445 as
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
written would affect bicycle rental
 
02:12:49.629 --> 02:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
businesses um with due to the verbage
 
02:12:51.549 --> 02:12:51.559 align:start position:0%
that's really not quite right in that
 
02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
bill um I want you to know that you know
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
I myself 62 years old I consider my
 
02:13:00.109 --> 02:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
fitness level mediocre or average I I
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
recently purchased a class one pedal
 
02:13:05.950 --> 02:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
assist uh electric bike I purchased it
 
02:13:07.709 --> 02:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
specifically so I could ride on rail
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
Trails its pedal assist technology has
 
02:13:13.709 --> 02:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
no throttle I have to be providing
 
02:13:16.549 --> 02:13:16.559 align:start position:0%
pressure uh providing energy to make
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
that bike go uh I don't think I've ever
 
02:13:21.549 --> 02:13:21.559 align:start position:0%
gotten that bike over 20 M an hour I
 
02:13:23.229 --> 02:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
just don't have it in me even with the
 
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
pedal assist so um my particular bike
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
has a maximum wattage of 320 Watts Which
 
02:13:32.830 --> 02:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
is less than 1/ half of horsepower
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's a very small amount of power uh
 
02:13:39.390 --> 02:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
in this class one bike and the category
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
of electric vehicles that we really do
 
02:13:43.149 --> 02:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
want to regulate we're talking about
 
02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles that have much higher wattage
 
02:13:49.229 --> 02:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
and power ratings literally uh in into
 
02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
the thousands 1,000 watts of power 5,000
 
02:13:55.149 --> 02:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
watts of power and some of these things
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
that look like electric bikes with 5,000
 
02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
watts of power are currently being
 
02:14:03.549 --> 02:14:03.559 align:start position:0%
marketed as if they are ebikes and there
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
some people are out there telling people
 
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
that oh this is an ebike you can ride it
 
02:14:10.229 --> 02:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
on a rail trail that is really not true
 
02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:12.599 align:start position:0%
if it's something that has that level of
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
wattage or power it is definitely does
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
not meet the classification of a class
 
02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
one or class to ebike um and in closing
 
02:14:22.189 --> 02:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
we do support the notion of a work
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
session uh or study session to look at
 
02:14:27.390 --> 02:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
the overlap and contradiction between
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%

Transportation uh also not taking a
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
position on the bill
 
02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning Mr chairman members
 
02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Jerry Bard
 
02:15:31.629 --> 02:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
I'm the active Transportation engineer
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
for the Department of
 
02:15:35.310 --> 02:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
Transportation Act of Transportation
 
02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
deals with um self-propelled means of of
 
02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation most people biking and
 
02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
walking typically so I'm here to speak
 
02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
on the house bill 1445 specifically how
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
it relates to Electric
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
bicycles one of the goals of the
 
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
recently released uh New Hampshire
 
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
pedestrian and bicycle plan is to
 
02:15:55.629 --> 02:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
encourage active
 
02:15:58.629 --> 02:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
Transportation The increased use of uh
 
02:16:00.589 --> 02:16:00.599 align:start position:0%
ebikes has a significant potential for
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
making bicycling easier and increasing
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
the number of grand stators who uh
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
commute and get around by bike uh as
 
02:16:10.589 --> 02:16:10.599 align:start position:0%
currently Written House Bill 1445 adds
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions Beyond those in existing
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire laws which has already
 
02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:15.270 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire laws which has already
been

02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:16:18.549 --> 02:16:18.559 align:start position:0%
stated um and these laws are common in
 
02:16:19.549 --> 02:16:19.559 align:start position:0%
many other
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
states um so this bill could potentially
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
discourage uh ebike use this opinion is
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
based on House Bill 1445 propos proposal
 
02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
to repeal New Hampshire's current ebike
 
02:16:37.309 --> 02:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
law and create two uh classes of ebikes
 
02:16:40.270 --> 02:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
one uh group of ebikes that are capable
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
of motor
 
02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:44.439 align:start position:0%
assist of speeds less than 15 miles an
 
02:16:46.830 --> 02:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
hour and ebikes capable of motor assist
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
speeds 15 miles an hour or faster the
 
02:16:52.150 --> 02:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do is unaware of any
 
02:16:54.509 --> 02:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
ebikes that limit the motor assist to
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
less than 15 M an hour therefore all
 
02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
ebikes in existence today would based on
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
this bill be restricted from all bike
 
02:17:05.309 --> 02:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
paths and rail
 
02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
trails and some equipment required by
 
02:17:12.669 --> 02:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
this bill for example brake lights uh is
 
02:17:14.830 --> 02:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
is not currently available on most
 
02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:16.349 align:start position:0%
is not currently available on most
existing

02:17:16.349 --> 02:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
existing
 
02:17:19.309 --> 02:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
ebikes and if there are any questions
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%

House Bill 1543 tried to address I I
 
02:17:50.549 --> 02:17:50.559 align:start position:0%

02:17:54.389 --> 02:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
either yeah yeah thank you yep uh any
 
02:17:57.750 --> 02:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
other questions I have one uh I sat on a
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
commission a few years ago the road
 
02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
usage of non-traditional motor vehicles
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
and the discussion of ebikes came up as
 
02:18:07.629 --> 02:18:07.639 align:start position:0%
well as the scooters and all the U um
 
02:18:09.309 --> 02:18:09.319 align:start position:0%
the other electric devices that are out
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
there we were told at the time that the
 
02:18:12.910 --> 02:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
federal government was in the process of
 
02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
coming up with their own definitions do
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know if that's true or if they're
 
02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:18.030 align:start position:0%
you know if that's true or if they're
having

02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
progress and I asked that only because
 
02:18:21.309 --> 02:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
that was our reason for not really
 
02:18:23.629 --> 02:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
getting into it uh and spending a lot of
 
02:18:26.070 --> 02:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
time with our own definitions to find
 
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
out that the federal government has a
 
02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:29.230 align:start position:0%
out that the federal government has a
different

02:18:29.230 --> 02:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:18:33.549 --> 02:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
idea um I believe and I'm going to leave
 
02:18:35.629 --> 02:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
it if some other experts might be able
 
02:18:38.429 --> 02:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
to answer this better uh there there is
 
02:18:42.990 --> 02:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
a federal code that that identifies um
 
02:18:45.910 --> 02:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
class one class two ebikes up to 20
 
02:18:47.790 --> 02:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
miles an hour but that's the that's the
 
02:18:50.070 --> 02:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
only Federal Regulation I'm aware of
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't know if You' heard I'll
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%

04:30:35.950 --> 04:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chairman I would
 
04:30:39.830 --> 04:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
recommend uh for OTP motion is ought to
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
pass is there a
 
04:30:43.990 --> 04:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative St
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
Clair would you care to speak to your
 
04:30:45.840 --> 04:30:48.030 align:start position:0%
Clair would you care to speak to your
motion

04:30:48.030 --> 04:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr
 
04:30:52.870 --> 04:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
chairman uh this seems like a very
 
04:30:56.670 --> 04:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
simple uh bill it um we did get
 
04:30:59.389 --> 04:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
statements from uh the New Hampshire off
 
04:31:01.630 --> 04:31:01.640 align:start position:0%
highway vehicle association uh who
 
04:31:03.550 --> 04:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
supported the bill because it equalizes
 
04:31:06.309 --> 04:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
the lines for operating and and it was
 
04:31:08.269 --> 04:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
also understood that fishing game
 
04:31:10.750 --> 04:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
desires to correct the disparity so I
 
04:31:13.510 --> 04:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
think it's one
 
04:31:16.670 --> 04:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
that our staff
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee the reader digest of what or
 
04:31:26.670 --> 04:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
version of what this bill
 
04:31:28.910 --> 04:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
does right now if you look at the
 
04:31:30.469 --> 04:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
penalties are driving without a license
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
while no HRV and on a snowmobile they
 
04:31:37.510 --> 04:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
match but they are less than the penalty
 
04:31:39.870 --> 04:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
for driving without a license if you
 
04:31:42.429 --> 04:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
were in a motor vehicle and so what this
 
04:31:44.550 --> 04:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
does in a nutshell is it makes the
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
penalties go from their current ones to
 
04:31:50.309 --> 04:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
matching the penalties of if you are
 
04:31:52.710 --> 04:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
driving a motor vehicle in the same
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances from 250 first offense and
 
04:31:59.349 --> 04:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
500 second offense so and it moves it up
 
04:32:02.590 --> 04:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
from $186 I think u in the in the
 
04:32:05.189 --> 04:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
current language so it's not a huge leap
 
04:32:08.309 --> 04:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
it just equalizes ohvs snowmobiles and
 
04:32:14.670 --> 04:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:17.189 --> 04:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
committee interestingly enough okay
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
representative Hill with that being said
 
04:32:23.349 --> 04:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
I will be voting no on this um I haven't
 
04:32:26.189 --> 04:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
heard any reason to
 
04:32:31.030 --> 04:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
increase um the penalties or fines on um
 
04:32:34.070 --> 04:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
driving without a license for so I'm not
 
04:32:37.389 --> 04:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
in favor of increasing them simply to
 
04:32:40.910 --> 04:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
equal fair enough I don't recall any
 
04:32:46.349 --> 04:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
other reason other than that
 
04:32:49.750 --> 04:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
myself representative syes so we did
 
04:32:51.790 --> 04:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
hear testimony from the prime sponsor
 
04:32:54.750 --> 04:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
and I've also been participating in uh
 
04:32:58.510 --> 04:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
ohrv commission um
 
04:32:58.520 --> 04:33:00.269 align:start position:0%
ohrv commission um
and

04:33:00.269 --> 04:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:03.710 --> 04:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh there is there's a there are problems
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
up north particularly um and especially
 
04:33:10.670 --> 04:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
at big events uh in terms of being able
 
04:33:14.349 --> 04:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
to uh enforce uh the
 
04:33:16.910 --> 04:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
speeding this particularly speeding
 
04:33:19.709 --> 04:33:19.719 align:start position:0%
issues um but more more so even
 
04:33:22.269 --> 04:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
suspended driver's licens people
 
04:33:25.551 --> 04:33:25.561 align:start position:0%
operating so I think this is an attempt
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh on the part of uh the people of the
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
North Country to um equalize the playing
 
04:33:37.551 --> 04:33:37.561 align:start position:0%
field anybody
 
04:33:40.869 --> 04:33:40.879 align:start position:0%
else seeing none I'll ask the clerk to

04:33:44.119 --> 04:33:45.150 align:start position:0%
call the role when he's ready the motion

speak to your motion represent yeah in
 
04:37:14.429 --> 04:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
the uh in the um the amendment excuse me
 
04:37:16.830 --> 04:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
it it's just adding where basically
 
04:37:18.830 --> 04:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
which say display of numbers it's adding
 
04:37:22.590 --> 04:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
and decals all right so we're adding
 
04:37:26.070 --> 04:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
that in because uh the boat fees uh is a
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
decal sticker we had to separate uh so
 
04:37:32.470 --> 04:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
we could get the uh Federal money to
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
continue because we weren't in compliant
 
04:37:36.590 --> 04:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
at that point so this brings it back
 
04:37:36.600 --> 04:37:37.510 align:start position:0%
at that point so this brings it back
into

04:37:37.510 --> 04:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:37:41.029 --> 04:37:41.039 align:start position:0%
compliance that's it and this was I know

04:41:01.070 --> 04:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
sir uh there's a a couple of bills on
 
04:41:02.670 --> 04:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
this and there's a lot of confusion
 
04:41:05.110 --> 04:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
about what should actually be done and I
 
04:41:06.510 --> 04:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
don't think this these either of these
 
04:41:08.868 --> 04:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
bills are really ready so um it' be
 
04:41:11.430 --> 04:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
better to take the time and look into
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
them deeper get a better bill out of
 
04:41:16.830 --> 04:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
it fair enough anybody else from the
 
04:41:19.550 --> 04:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
committee and I will agree uh we've got
 
04:41:22.750 --> 04:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
two bills that deal with pevs this year
 
04:41:24.590 --> 04:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
they kind of do different things
 
04:41:26.990 --> 04:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees some change needs to
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
occur but nobody can agree on either one
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
of these directions so let's try again
 
04:41:34.270 --> 04:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
next year uh we could have interim
 
04:41:37.230 --> 04:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
studied it but again same result I will
 
04:41:39.470 --> 04:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
and somebody gave me the idea I'll
 
04:41:40.628 --> 04:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
mention to the New Hampshire
 
04:41:42.990 --> 04:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation Council if this is a
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
topic they want to tackle on their own
 
04:41:48.750 --> 04:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
so for that I'll I'll support the it
 
04:41:51.350 --> 04:41:51.360 align:start position:0%

for I'll open up the executive session
 
04:43:37.270 --> 04:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
04:43:39.590 --> 04:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
1062 relative to the use of Special
 
04:43:41.948 --> 04:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
cover plates she recognizes
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
representative C for a motion I move
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motions ought to pass is
 
04:43:50.230 --> 04:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:53.150 --> 04:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative Hill
 
04:43:55.470 --> 04:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
would you care to speak to motion thank
 
04:43:58.510 --> 04:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
you uh this clarifies something that
 
04:44:00.110 --> 04:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
some people believe was already
 
04:44:03.230 --> 04:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
acceptable and that is to allow the use
 
04:44:05.550 --> 04:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
of just one of the Special cover plates
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
over one of the regular plates on your
 
04:44:11.350 --> 04:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
car okay here anything enough simple
 
04:44:13.270 --> 04:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
enough anybody else from the
 
04:44:15.750 --> 04:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
committee and it the bill really is that
 
04:44:17.150 --> 04:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
simple I thought you could I thought you
 
04:44:22.830 --> 04:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:27.628 --> 04:44:27.638 align:start position:0%
else so um my concern is that if we I
 
04:44:29.350 --> 04:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
think we need clarity about whether you
 
04:44:31.708 --> 04:44:31.718 align:start position:0%
can already do it and if you can already
 
04:44:34.190 --> 04:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
do it then we don't need the bill and so
 
04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
I I think we don't have quite enough
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
information and you know for that reason
 
04:44:42.510 --> 04:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
I may I will probably vote against the
 
04:44:44.990 --> 04:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
motion fair enough but I think this bill
 
04:44:46.590 --> 04:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
actually is the clarification it adds
 
04:44:48.750 --> 04:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
one sentence to the statute anybody else
 
04:44:50.590 --> 04:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
from the committee I know this is going
 
04:44:52.780 --> 04:44:52.790 align:start position:0%
to be a huge floor fight either
 
04:44:52.790 --> 04:44:54.550 align:start position:0%
to be a huge floor fight either

representative Hill for a motion uh
 
04:47:32.750 --> 04:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would move out

to pass on house Bill 1183 I'm sorry
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
1083 yep uh motion is ought to pass is
 
04:47:41.830 --> 04:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:45.230 --> 04:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
second was that represent fox fox or
 
04:47:49.110 --> 04:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
Romo I didn't see okay um een
 
04:47:49.120 --> 04:47:50.230 align:start position:0%
Romo I didn't see okay um een
representative

04:47:50.230 --> 04:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:47:52.750 --> 04:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
fox h would you care to speak to your
 
04:47:58.350 --> 04:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
motion certainly um so my plain reading
 
04:48:04.150 --> 04:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
of section 261 colon 17 uh Roman 3 says
 
04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
that you can do this uh that the
 
04:48:08.708 --> 04:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
surviving owner who when it is uh joint
 
04:48:11.708 --> 04:48:11.718 align:start position:0%
ownership held be with an and between
 
04:48:14.910 --> 04:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
their names um the surviving owner can
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
transfer the vehicle without obtaining a
 
04:48:17.280 --> 04:48:18.350 align:start position:0%
transfer the vehicle without obtaining a
new

04:48:18.350 --> 04:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
title up to and including the the day
 
04:48:25.548 --> 04:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
that uh a new registration is needed so
 
04:48:28.390 --> 04:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me logical if you can
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
transfer it at that point with just the
 
04:48:33.708 --> 04:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
single signature and a death certificate
 
04:48:36.910 --> 04:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
that there shouldn't be any reason why
 
04:48:40.270 --> 04:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
uh a new title is required and in a
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
situation that I had um this
 
04:48:47.310 --> 04:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
Veteran's spouse
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
said virtually every piece of her life
 
04:48:55.510 --> 04:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
is being um separated from her husband
 
04:48:58.150 --> 04:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
as she goes along and this was just the
 
04:49:01.230 --> 04:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
last piece that um they told her she
 
04:49:04.270 --> 04:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't have beyond that year I Grant
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
you that's a heartstring thing but I
 
04:49:09.750 --> 04:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
will also point out that in any number
 
04:49:12.110 --> 04:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
of other circumstances as a financial
 
04:49:15.070 --> 04:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
advisor I run into joint and
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
survivorship all the time with um with
 
04:49:20.350 --> 04:49:20.360 align:start position:0%
financial instruments and they don't
 
04:49:23.548 --> 04:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
require you to retitle things um they're
 
04:49:26.910 --> 04:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
held perfectly fine um even though it's
 
04:49:29.590 --> 04:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
a higher worth than probably this
 
04:49:32.030 --> 04:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle is definitely more than this
 
04:49:35.470 --> 04:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle is so um I just don't see any
 
04:49:39.390 --> 04:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
any reason why um it should be required
 
04:49:44.350 --> 04:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
here um and not uh over just that time
 
04:49:47.750 --> 04:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
period so with that I'm voting a to
 
04:49:52.670 --> 04:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:55.750 --> 04:49:55.760 align:start position:0%

04:52:23.708 --> 04:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
am the prime sponsor on it it's a simple
 
04:52:26.948 --> 04:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
bill this was a housekeeping oh sorry I
 
04:52:29.310 --> 04:52:29.320 align:start position:0%

04:52:32.670 --> 04:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
representative Jones thank you uh so
 
04:52:34.390 --> 04:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
I'll speak just briefly to it this was a
 
04:52:35.948 --> 04:52:35.958 align:start position:0%
housekeeping measure right basically for
 
04:52:37.948 --> 04:52:37.958 align:start position:0%
the Department of Motor Vehicles it just
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
clarifies the use and color of some of
 
04:52:42.190 --> 04:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
the headlights that are becoming popular
 
04:52:46.270 --> 04:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
on uh Vehicles nowadays it also deals
 
04:52:49.750 --> 04:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
with your ride share companies and the
 
04:52:51.350 --> 04:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
the lighting that they use which I don't
 
04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
know if you've seen Uber but when
 
04:52:55.390 --> 04:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
they're on they're blue and they do look
 
04:52:57.670 --> 04:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
like law enforcement so this simply
 
04:52:59.150 --> 04:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
requires them to shut it off when
 
04:53:00.350 --> 04:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
they're driving and turn it on when
 
04:53:03.270 --> 04:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
they're parked simple enough um there
 
04:53:06.270 --> 04:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
there some a few changes in in in in the
 
04:53:07.948 --> 04:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
penalties too but they reminder that
 
04:53:09.750 --> 04:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't the reason for the bill was just
 
04:53:12.190 --> 04:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
to clarify some of these other things
 
04:53:14.430 --> 04:53:14.440 align:start position:0%

session uh few minutes next up will be
 
04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:32.480 --> 04:55:02.628 align:start position:0%
 
three

04:55:02.628 --> 04:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:02.638 --> 04:55:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.400 --> 04:56:02.310 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:02.320 --> 04:56:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
for

04:56:23.030 --> 04:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay um change of plans uh I've decided
 
04:56:29.150 --> 04:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
only because of the
 
04:56:31.110 --> 04:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh to give the prime
 
04:56:32.708 --> 04:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor who could not make it that day
 
04:56:35.270 --> 04:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
one more opport opportunity um and I
 
04:56:37.150 --> 04:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
guess it was an attempt to send me some
 
04:56:38.788 --> 04:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
written testimony which I did not
 
04:56:40.990 --> 04:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
receive so we're not in the rush on it
 
04:56:43.110 --> 04:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's not an early bill in all fairness
 
04:56:44.390 --> 04:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
let me find out what's going on with
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
