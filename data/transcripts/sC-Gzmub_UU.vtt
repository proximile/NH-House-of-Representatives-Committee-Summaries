happening are you seeing it's like
 

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:17.430 align:start position:0%
happening are you seeing it's like

give us a sense of in your research how

give us a sense of in your research how

01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
often is this
 

01:09:22.239 --> 01:09:25.149 align:start position:0%
often is this
happening<01:09:23.239><c> well</c><01:09:23.560><c> my</c><01:09:23.920><c> answer</c><01:09:24.120><c> to</c><01:09:24.239><c> that</c><01:09:24.480><c> is</c><01:09:24.880><c> it's</c>

01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
happening well my answer to that is it's
 

01:09:25.159 --> 01:09:26.950 align:start position:0%
happening well my answer to that is it's
it's<01:09:25.319><c> not</c><01:09:25.480><c> a</c><01:09:25.679><c> problem</c><01:09:26.000><c> tell</c><01:09:26.279><c> it's</c><01:09:26.400><c> a</c><01:09:26.640><c> problem</c>

01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem tell it's a problem
 

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.309 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem tell it's a problem
but<01:09:27.120><c> when</c><01:09:27.239><c> it's</c><01:09:27.400><c> a</c><01:09:27.560><c> problem</c><01:09:27.799><c> it's</c><01:09:27.920><c> a</c><01:09:28.040><c> real</c>

01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
but when it's a problem it's a real
 

01:09:28.319 --> 01:09:30.430 align:start position:0%
but when it's a problem it's a real
problem<01:09:29.199><c> because</c><01:09:29.400><c> if</c><01:09:29.520><c> you're</c><01:09:29.759><c> the</c><01:09:29.960><c> guy</c><01:09:30.199><c> who</c>

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
problem because if you're the guy who
 

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.829 align:start position:0%
problem because if you're the guy who
just<01:09:30.600><c> ran</c><01:09:30.839><c> out</c><01:09:31.000><c> of</c><01:09:31.120><c> a</c><01:09:31.239><c> charge</c><01:09:31.920><c> and</c><01:09:32.159><c> somebody</c><01:09:32.600><c> is</c>

01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
just ran out of a charge and somebody is
 

01:09:32.839 --> 01:09:35.349 align:start position:0%
just ran out of a charge and somebody is

01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
F350 uh and they they're not coming back
 

01:09:40.759 --> 01:09:42.590 align:start position:0%
F350 uh and they they're not coming back
anytime<01:09:41.239><c> soon</c><01:09:41.520><c> you're</c><01:09:41.719><c> out</c><01:09:41.880><c> of</c>

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
anytime soon you're out of
 

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:47.229 align:start position:0%
anytime soon you're out of
luck<01:09:43.759><c> so</c><01:09:44.839><c> uh</c><01:09:45.839><c> that's</c><01:09:46.159><c> the</c><01:09:46.400><c> that's</c><01:09:46.600><c> the</c><01:09:46.839><c> problem</c>

01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
luck so uh that's the that's the problem
 

01:09:47.239 --> 01:09:50.349 align:start position:0%
luck so uh that's the that's the problem
it's<01:09:47.440><c> just</c><01:09:47.600><c> like</c><01:09:47.920><c> how</c><01:09:48.480><c> often</c><01:09:49.480><c> was</c><01:09:49.839><c> the</c><01:09:50.080><c> problem</c>

01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
it's just like how often was the problem
 

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:53.749 align:start position:0%
it's just like how often was the problem
with<01:09:50.640><c> handicap</c><01:09:51.279><c> spaces</c><01:09:52.279><c> a</c><01:09:52.560><c> problem</c><01:09:53.040><c> until</c><01:09:53.359><c> we</c>

01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
with handicap spaces a problem until we
 

01:09:53.759 --> 01:09:55.669 align:start position:0%
with handicap spaces a problem until we

01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
started recognizing that as
 

01:09:55.679 --> 01:10:00.470 align:start position:0%

01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
now if you add charging stations in that

else so um my concern is that if we I
 

04:44:27.638 --> 04:44:29.350 align:start position:0%
else so um my concern is that if we I
think<04:44:27.798><c> we</c><04:44:27.920><c> need</c><04:44:28.200><c> clarity</c><04:44:28.718><c> about</c><04:44:28.958><c> whether</c><04:44:29.160><c> you</c>

04:44:29.350 --> 04:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
think we need clarity about whether you
 

04:44:29.360 --> 04:44:31.708 align:start position:0%
think we need clarity about whether you
can<04:44:29.680><c> already</c><04:44:30.080><c> do</c><04:44:30.240><c> it</c><04:44:30.480><c> and</c><04:44:30.600><c> if</c><04:44:30.760><c> you</c><04:44:30.958><c> can</c><04:44:31.280><c> already</c>

04:44:31.708 --> 04:44:31.718 align:start position:0%
can already do it and if you can already
 

04:44:31.718 --> 04:44:34.190 align:start position:0%
can already do it and if you can already
do<04:44:31.878><c> it</c><04:44:32.080><c> then</c><04:44:32.240><c> we</c><04:44:32.360><c> don't</c><04:44:32.560><c> need</c><04:44:32.840><c> the</c><04:44:32.958><c> bill</c><04:44:33.520><c> and</c><04:44:33.718><c> so</c>

04:44:34.190 --> 04:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
do it then we don't need the bill and so
 

04:44:34.200 --> 04:44:36.390 align:start position:0%
do it then we don't need the bill and so
I<04:44:34.718><c> I</c><04:44:34.840><c> think</c><04:44:35.000><c> we</c><04:44:35.120><c> don't</c><04:44:35.360><c> have</c><04:44:35.600><c> quite</c><04:44:35.840><c> enough</c>

04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
I I think we don't have quite enough
 

04:44:36.400 --> 04:44:38.788 align:start position:0%
I I think we don't have quite enough
information<04:44:37.400><c> and</c><04:44:37.760><c> you</c><04:44:37.878><c> know</c><04:44:38.080><c> for</c><04:44:38.320><c> that</c><04:44:38.480><c> reason</c>

04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
information and you know for that reason
 

04:44:38.798 --> 04:44:42.510 align:start position:0%
information and you know for that reason
I<04:44:38.958><c> may</c><04:44:39.400><c> I</c><04:44:39.480><c> will</c><04:44:39.840><c> probably</c><04:44:40.280><c> vote</c><04:44:40.560><c> against</c><04:44:40.840><c> the</c>

04:44:42.510 --> 04:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
I may I will probably vote against the
 

04:44:42.520 --> 04:44:44.990 align:start position:0%
I may I will probably vote against the
motion<04:44:43.520><c> fair</c><04:44:43.798><c> enough</c><04:44:44.040><c> but</c><04:44:44.200><c> I</c><04:44:44.280><c> think</c><04:44:44.520><c> this</c><04:44:44.680><c> bill</c>

04:44:44.990 --> 04:44:45.000 align:start position:0%

04:44:46.590 --> 04:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
actually is the clarification it adds
 

04:44:46.600 --> 04:44:48.750 align:start position:0%
