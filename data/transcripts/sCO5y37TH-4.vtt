00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
it being 9:00
 
00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 align:start position:0%
I will call the finance division
 
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 align:start position:0%
2 meeting to start and we have the
 
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 align:start position:0%
today so begin with what we're going to
 
00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
yourselves good
 
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
morning for the record Frank GBL
 
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education
 
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
Tammy Valen cour CFO for the Department
 
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
um and so what I thought that we would
 
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
do is uh start out you have a PowerPoint
 
00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 align:start position:0%
presentation some house spill 2 language
 
00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
some staffing handout as well um as the
 
00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
you know entire uh Governor's phase
 
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
budget packet um what I wanted to do was
 
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
just kind of give you an overview of the
 
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
budget for a moment through that
 
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint presentation I'll try to move
 
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
through that fairly quickly um and then
 
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
open it up for questions for myself and
 
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
then my whole team is available uh as
 
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
long as needed to answer any questions
 
00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
that the committee might have um but I
 
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
thought it would be helpful to kind of
 
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
level set everybody through that
 
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint presentation so I would turn
 
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
your attention to this document right
 
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
now and uh the first thing that I'm
 
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
going to do is I'm going to introduce
 
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
you to the team of people here at the
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um so uh
 
00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
Christine Brennan the Deputy
 
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioner was not able to be here she
 
00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
had a a family emergency that she had to
 
00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
tend to last night um and so was not
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
able to make it um but you can see that
 
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh that is the office of the Deputy
 
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioner and under that office you
 
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
have the um the Bureau of DDS uh
 
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
disability determination Services um
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
which is a something that we provide for
 
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
Social Security it's basically a service
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
provider to adjudicate disability claims
 
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
for the federal government it's fully
 
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
federally funded but an important thing
 
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
for you to context because you may not
 
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
think of that when you think about the
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
department of of Education um there are
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
about 80 individuals in that Bureau um
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
as well you have the uh vocation
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation um The Bureau director
 
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
here is uh Rich Salah is sitting right
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
behind me the guy with the fair face um
 
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
and so he runs that Bureau Vocational uh
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation
 
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
um we've also got the division of
 
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
Education analytics and resources and so
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
we've got Caitlyn Davis and Mark
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
manganella who many of you probably
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
already know because he does uh
 
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
education funding scenarios uh in his
 
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
sleep at this point in time um so you
 
00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 align:start position:0%
can ask him many questions and also
 
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
Brian is here I'm looking behind me um
 
00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 align:start position:0%
then we've got the division of learner
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
support which is uh Tammy or not Tammy
 
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm looking at my paper Melissa
 
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
sitting behind me over here um you know
 
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
all things education she's happy to um
 
00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 align:start position:0%
to respond to that stuff as well we've
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
got the division of educator support and
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
higher education so Steve appelby is
 
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
right behind me as well and uh so he's
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
able to answer questions and then Tammy
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
has introduced herself who is our CFO um
 
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
I will say just a little bit of bragging
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
I do have the best leadership team um in
 
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
the entire state so they are sitting
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
behind me uh so my back is well covered
 
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
and they are and you are well covered as
 
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
well because they're able to answer many
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
questions on the next slide uh this is a
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
slide that actually um has some history
 
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
I first put it together when I got to
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
the department it is just in one page
 
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
gives you an overview as to what's going
 
00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
on at the department Department of
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
Education um and uh it so it kind of
 
00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
puts stuff in context I think a little
 
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
bit the way that this is organized um is
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
at the top it's like a p&amp;l uh at the top
 
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
you've got all the funding sources that
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
we have coming into the Department of
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
Education uh we also carve out um
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
anecdotally the information that we have
 
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
relative to local education fun funding
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh District enrollment average cost per
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
pupil um and then the next sections that
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
we have in here and I think one of the
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
things that's really important for
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
people to understand is the department
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh like operates primarily as a flowr
 
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
organization we receive money and we
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
send money out to our school districts
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
is essentially what we do uh we try to
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
lift as little off of the top as we can
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
to administrate that process um but you
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
will see that so we've got um under
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
General funds you've got General funds
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
state aid uh you'll notice that there
 
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
are no residual funds but historically
 
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
there have been some funds in there um
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
and and some of those funds and you'll
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
see this throughout here so you've got
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
Dropout prevention Statewide special
 
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
education a Career Technical student
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
organizations um building Aid lease um
 
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
and I point out building Aid lease
 
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
because in uh the last budget or maybe
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
that was two budgets ago some of these
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
items were moved down out of the general
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
funds into the education trust fund so
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
as an example you'll see building a
 
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
lease is an item that is down I 1 2 3 4
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
five six seven lines up from the bottom
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
in the education trust fund at the
 
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
bottom so just keep an eye on that if
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
you don't see something up top just make
 
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
sure you didn't have it moved down below
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
the next is just general funds p through
 
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
so these are funds that the
 
00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
legislature uh provides to the
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
department and our job is really just to
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
push those through into specific
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
programming um again some of those items
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
have moved down below most notably the
 
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
court order placements which is that
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
first item that you have there um and
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to briefly talk about
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
quot order placements so quot order
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
placements is basic basically uh uh if a
 
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
student is adjudicated by a judge to be
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
placed in a specific educational setting
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
um you know the state is responsible for
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
payment of the cost ass sets through
 
00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
with that setting um and you'll you know
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's got $2 million but you need to
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
understand that that is uh a line item
 
00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
for which we have warrant Authority so
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
that if it costs more than that I just
 
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
have to draw a warrant to be able to pay
 
00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:25.879 align:start position:0%
those bills uh however many kids get uh
 
00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
placed um and and we take care of that
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
um but you can see you've got you know
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
some scholarships uh you know the New
 
00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of higher education we
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
may want to talk to about that at some
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
point in time but a variety of different
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
programs that you can see throughout
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
there and then you get down to really
 
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
the general fund salary and benefits and
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
operating um and so this is essentially
 
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
the Staffing uh costs and the um you
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
know the doit the Department of
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
administr Services costs that we pay
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
rent phones um associated with the the
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
team at the Department of Education and
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
we'll talk a little bit about Staffing
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
as we move on and then you get down into
 
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund where there is
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
a variety of um you know costs that are
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
associated with it some of this stuff
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
again has moved from below to above um
 
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
over the years as uh legislature has
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes moved stuff into the education
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
trust funds sometimes moved stuff out of
 
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
the education trust funds but kind of
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
has a transitory effect but it's all
 
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
kind of it's all kind of transparent
 
00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
there for you to be able to take a look
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
at including um a number which is
 
00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
generally highly um sought after which
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
is our district public school adequacy
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
number again Mark is here and Caitlyn
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
are here to address that um Charter
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
Schools EFA programs um that you'll be
 
00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
able to see um and uh so these are a
 
00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
variety of things that we kind of move
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
through the the one item that I will
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
point out at the second line up from the
 
00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:54.519 align:start position:0%
bottom is the public school
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund these are the safety
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
grants um that we have
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
received and in since
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
2018 and I think I'm pausing on this
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
because I think it's an important policy
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
thing for us since 2018 we have put uh
 
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
well north of $50 million into school
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
safety uh this is primarily around
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
hardening our assets so that uh you know
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
our children are safe and protected
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
includes and we work very closely with
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security on this but includes
 
00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
things like Access Control Systems you
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
know making sure we got door locks that
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
we've got uh you know we use a certain
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
type of film on on ground level Windows
 
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that those are protected um
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
every time that there is uh any kind of
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
a incident uh relative to safety of um
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
schools across the country um I
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
personally do a deep dive to figure out
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
what happened how did it happen uh do we
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
have the right controls and um safety
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
protocols in place to try and mitigate
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm not saying that you can
 
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
mitigate all stupid but we do what we
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
can to try and make sure but I I pause
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
on this as well to point out
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
that um I think that the funding
 
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
associated with this while it is not
 
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
insignificant I get that's a lot of
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
money um should not be a reactionary
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
funding line item so we have put uh $5
 
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:20.839 align:start position:0%
million at least uh into this every year
 
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
since uh more than that since I've been
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
the commissioner but um and and the
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
purpose is that we don't this should not
 
00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
be reactive like we have a bad incidence
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
and so then we say oh my gosh we have to
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
harden our schools like I'm the the
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
opinion that we should just be like
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're taking and
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
upgrading our safety um all the time uh
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
to try and prevent something uh what I
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
would refer to as stupid from happening
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
so that just gives you kind of an
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
overall perspective of what a p&amp;l might
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
look like for the Department on the next
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
commission can I we take questions
 
00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
during your represent papich thank you
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and good morning thank you for
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
being here very quick question I don't
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
want to obviously we have a lot to go
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
through I was looking at Public School
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure line you were talking
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
about and it seems to go from 1 million
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
a year two budgets ago to zero and then
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
to 5 mil do you have a bit of you know
 
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
color around that CU you were saying
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
you'd like it to be consistent and
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
obviously it's anything but so it
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
actually is quite consistent if you go
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
back it's just that what happens is some
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
of the funding sources where it comes
 
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
from don't show up in these in the
 
00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:24.519 align:start position:0%
agency line item so for example last
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
year um I spent $10 million and I got it
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
from the yeah it's on it's it's was
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
onetime Appropriations we had some
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
Surplus and so you guys funded it out of
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
the surplus funds so we have
 
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
consistently since 2018 funded these
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
amounts uh sometimes the legislature and
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
us we get as creative as we can to make
 
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
sure we do it but we are always um you
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
know coming up with those funds for that
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
I guess before I leave that slide as
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
well then we have headcount although I
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
have a separate slide on headcount that
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839 align:start position:0%
about okay on the next slide um proposed
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
appro rations again this is provides you
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
a little bit more detail of the agency
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
phase versus the governor's phase on
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
some of the more important items that
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
you'll see um for example if you get the
 
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
district public school adequacy number
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
um bear in mind that we're doing our
 
00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:16.519 align:start position:0%
initial calculation at the agency phase
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
well before we know what the fall
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
enrollment is going to be so we're just
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
kind of making some estimates as to what
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
might happen Governor's phase comes out
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
we have a little bit more information
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
even today we may have more information
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
so um that adjusts education Freedom
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
accounts similarly we're making adjust
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
and estimates uh you know before we have
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers um and then the
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
governor's uh policies are reflected in
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
the governor's phase um special
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
education Aid again uh you know we had
 
00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
the agency phase we do it at the time
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
that we have uh the information and as
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
you know it's been quite highly
 
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
publicized that we were $60 million
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
short in terms of our uh appropriation
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
for that and I guess I'll pause for a
 
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
moment at this as well and just explain
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
the process so essentially what's
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
happening is you have school districts
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
that are spending funds uh throughout
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
the year um and then at the end of the
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
year they send me a box of invoices and
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
we add those up so we had been
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
appropriated $34 million uh when I added
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
up the box of invoices in the fall I had
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
$50 million worth of uh invoices and so
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
we were $16 million short so we uh in
 
00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:18.759 align:start position:0%
law we basically prate the amount that
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
we receive um and so the governor has
 
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
added that $16 million to that um we've
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
done some analysis since then uh to kind
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
of understand where um you know the
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
schools are with respect to that and and
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
what I would suggest is that you know we
 
00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:35.759 align:start position:0%
don't have great internal controls
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily at the school level to flag
 
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
for the agency or for the state when
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
those items are over budget um you know
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
the districts themselves were about $60
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
million over budget on that line item
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
but that's just kind of information that
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
comes to light at the end of the year uh
 
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
the next thing that I will point out is
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
we started in the agency phase with four
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
proposed CTE Renovations uh for those of
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
you who are not familiar with the way
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
the CTE Renovations work is uh we have a
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
list it's kind of a Quee that school
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
districts get in um and it's a very uh
 
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
inadequate way of allocating Capital to
 
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh building projects in the state of New
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it is one that has existed
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
for I think we're approaching 50 years
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
at this point in time um we have a study
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
commission that will be issuing a report
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
in May about a better way to allocate
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
Capital rather than just wait until uh
 
00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:28.519 align:start position:0%
25 years has elapse and then you get to
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
try and build build again um and but
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
this year we did have four projects that
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
came forward um only two of those
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
projects has continued forward uh so we
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
had conal msic Jaffrey and Milford um we
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
only have Jaffrey and Milford who are
 
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
continuing forward in their uh
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try and do that part of
 
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
that is because uh to do a CTE rebuild
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
requires investment by the local
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
community and a vote by the local
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
community um to support you know the
 
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
state matches 75% and the Local District
 
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
comes up at
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
25% um and uh at this point in time none
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
of those districts has voted they will
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
be voting in the shortly here and we'll
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
see how those H those go we did have a
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
hearing with the public uh what was the
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
commission was it it wasn't Capital was
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
it capital capital yeah so we went to
 
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
Capital already and um you know they
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
said come back once you get a vote in
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
place right because we don't have the
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
local communities voted but two of those
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
projects are moving forward and you can
 
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
see as we go forward the numbers get
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
tuned up we're getting them very early
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the process I think I had to present
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
these like last April we were we were
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
initially submitting those um and as
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
they fine-tune their pencils um and and
 
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
they recognize the uh the fiscal you
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
know uh herdal and challenges sometimes
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
those numbers come down and you can see
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's the case here so um it was
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
interesting that uh Milford did not show
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
up in the governor's budget um we
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
believe that was an oversight uh we know
 
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
that they knew about it it was in our
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
budget we knew we submitted it to them
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
we even um while they were excuse me
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
putting their budget together uh we sent
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
them an email saying here's the updated
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
number but somehow that was there was an
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
oversight and it did not get included in
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
the governor's phas but it was always a
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
project and should you should not the
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
fact that it was not in the governor's
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
phase the school district did nothing
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
wrong all the communications were there
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
I think that was just an oversight on
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
the next slide um just to give you kind
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
of some perspective of enrollment in the
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
public school system
 
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
um if you want to know our Peak if we go
 
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039 align:start position:0%
back to 2002 is when we peaked we had
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
230,000 students um so you can see we've
 
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
gone from 230 to two to 185 so uh you
 
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
know north of 47 uh, or 45,000 student
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
fewer students that we have at this
 
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
point in time in that system um and this
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
is a demographic trend that is has been
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
real for the pl past two and a half
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
decades but will continue into the
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
future there are um you know it's not
 
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
that difficult to see that uh you know
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I I sit as a
 
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:06.919 align:start position:0%
trustee for the University system of New
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I have uh a traditional
 
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
thing that I uh present in my October
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
meeting I think it is we have like a
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
early fall meeting and I announced that
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
the class of 2035 started kindergarten
 
00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
and plan accordingly right so we pretty
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
much know with this really narrow
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
standard deviation how many kids are
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
going to be available to go to the
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
postsecondary systems but it just gives
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
you some context in terms of where our
 
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.430 align:start position:0%
you some context in terms of where our
students

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
are papich thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
a very quick question on this graph the
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
EFA students some of them do go to
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
public charter schools or non-public
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
schools is I'm assuming that this is not
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
double counting anybody in any way but
 
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to understand which column does
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
a student go into when they are an EA
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
student that goes to a public charter so
 
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
first of all if a student is a public
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
charter student they would not be
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive an FAA
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
um but if a student goes to a non-public
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
school as an EFA student they are an EFA
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
student um the way that the law Works in
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that uh we have
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
compulsory education students between
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
the ages of six and 18 are required to
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
be enrolled in a an approved public educ
 
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
in approved education program at the
 
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire um those include
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools traditional in
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
Charter our non-public schools our home
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
education students as well as our um
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
students on the next slide um what I
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to just point out is some funding
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
that came to the department through
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
surplus funds like so these are kind of
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
one-time funding and I point these out
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
because clearly these are not in my
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
budget um and in terms of the carry
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
forward items but it's something for you
 
00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
to I mean so we spent the money we got
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
the money or we're spend we either spent
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
or we're spending the money because they
 
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
were one-time Appropriations but if you
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
go back to that Trend analysis on the
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
third slide where I gave you the
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
overview these are items that are one
 
00:19:59.789 --> 00:19:59.799 align:start position:0%
time that would not be part of of that
 
00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
um so for example student Clearing House
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature asked us to go out and
 
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
purchase a license for student Clearing
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
House to be able to track our students
 
00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
that move into postsecondary um the
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
legislature provided $900,000 of funding
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
for mtssb work um primarily related to
 
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.270 align:start position:0%
for mtssb work um primarily related to
RCA

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
RCA
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
135 um we received a million dollars to
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
develop Civics education curriculum uh
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
we did do that with Discovery Education
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
and continue on that work but the New
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Civics channel has been
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
published um we've got Computer Science
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
Education Program included $4 million um
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
to try and uh you know enhance the
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
number of computer science uh credential
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
Educators in our system uh we received
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
onetime funding for adult education of
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
500,000 um in many of the covid relief
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
programs the adult dead programs were
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
kind of like an afterthought at the
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
federal level and so they did not get as
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
much um you know support as for CO as
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
some of the other folks did and so this
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
was one time you know appropriation at
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature gave us for that work um
 
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of the education trust fund so
 
00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:04.039 align:start position:0%
there you can see Public School
 
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund was the $10 million
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative that you had mentioned
 
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
um we received a for CTE a tuition and
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
transportation Grant of $4 million um
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
and this was important to know because
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
we the goal was to try and provide
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
additional funds into uh CTE
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
particularly around tuition and
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
transportation um we did a $4 million we
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
did get an appropriation for $4 million
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
we did not put that as a formula Grant
 
00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
out to the districts and it was very
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
specifically done that way uh the way we
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
receive about uh SE a little over $7
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
million of Perkins Federal money to be
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
used in our Career and Technical
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
education programming um that comes with
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
Ane maintenance of effort uh that if you
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's basically an all or nothing if you
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
decrease that by $1 like if you don't
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
you have to incre you have to maintain
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
or increase the spending each time if
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
you decrease you lose your whole Federal
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
grant um so we felt that it was
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
imprudent to uh the $4 million to the
 
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
ongoing funding knowing that that would
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
have made a per you couldn't do it with
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
surplus funds it would have been a
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
permanent funding commitment in order to
 
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
maintain our peras grants so we did it
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
as a competitive Grant and we've been
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
offering those competitive grants to the
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
districts um you know since we received
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
that funding um and and it is out there
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
right now even even so it's a non-aps
 
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
amount uh and I think we had about $1.6
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
million left uh or is it 1.6 was the
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
allocated do you remember about half of
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's been used yeah um kindergarten Aid
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
is to help those districts that are
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
expanding uh episode of treatment so
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is similar to court ordered
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
placements uh you know when the state
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
put the fast forward program in place
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
that allowed students or children or
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
really anybody to get kind of immediate
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
mental health supports if someone's
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
suffering then they send out kind of a
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
crisis team out there um sometimes that
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
results in someone being adjudicated
 
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
into an education program um because of
 
00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
the the needs that they have there was
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
no fund in in order to pay the costs of
 
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
those and so there was kind of this
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
loophole between the Department of
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
Education and uh the Department of
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services so uh we
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
created a law and and we so to to fund
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
these episodes of treatment such that uh
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know when someone gets adjudicated
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
we're able to use those funds to support
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
them um and then you can see as well uh
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
our CTE funding last year was done
 
00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:23.559 align:start position:0%
through Surplus funding rather than
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
through the education trust fund or
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
through the capital budget um and those
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
two projects are underway and and uh you
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
know moving well in terms of being built
 
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
on the next slide you're going to see
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
our prioritized needs um and I'm going
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
to take these in reverse order if I got
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
any prioritized need the one I need the
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
most is that last item the state
 
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
administrator for assessment um and what
 
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
this is is so I have an individual who
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
is paid with federal funds um but that
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
individual needs to be working on some
 
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
of the state level efforts that you all
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
have passed particularly around the
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
Civics assessment um because they're
 
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
paid with federal funds they're not
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
permiss it's not permissible for them to
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
work on state requirements um and so I
 
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
need that allocation to be able to
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
administer the programs that you pass so
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
we got the law passed but then I need
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
somebody to basically administer that
 
00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
and in particular this is going to be
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
around the Civics assessment and you'll
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
see we have some hb2 language there um
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
and we have been trying since uh 2018 to
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
get get a good grasp on this but it's
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
difficult to grab the information but
 
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
we've now built a portal for the
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
students to take the legislative requ
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
legislatively re ired um ins Civics
 
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
assessment um and it's the same assess
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
we buil it in the same assessment portal
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
that they use for the English language
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
arts for the science or for the
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
mathematics assessment so it' be very
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
easy for the districts to administer and
 
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
it's very easy for us to roll that
 
00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
information up to provide you with
 
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
feedback in terms of how that is going
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
but I do need that Mo Money to be moved
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
over and then I'm going to talk about
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
the next two items which is the learning
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
platform um this is is uh vendor
 
00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
specific uh which is always a little bit
 
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
nervous when you do something that's
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
vendor specific but this is for a
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
program called Discovery Education uh
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
during the the pandemic um we entered
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
into a contract we competitively bid and
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
we entered into a contract with a
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
company called Discovery Education to
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
provide highquality instructional
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
materials to our students um what we saw
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
is that some districts had high quality
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
instructional materials were doing a
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
great job other ones were sending home
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
you know kind of lousy manila envelopes
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
with worksheets in them and uh it didn't
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
really work that well so we did contract
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
with discovery education to make high
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
quality instructional materials
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
available to everyone in the state um
 
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
the what is exciting relative to that is
 
00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
that every single School in New
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is using the platform right so
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
some sometimes I say sometimes like I
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
could offer gold bars and there may be
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
um some districts that are like nah
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
we're good here we don't have any place
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
to store the gold bars so we don't need
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
them but this is something that clearly
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
has met a need we've got well over a
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
million and a half engagements from uh
 
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
Educators throughout the state that are
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
working on that platform form so I I'm
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
impressed with the site my school
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
districts are impressed with the site
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
and it is essentially it is supporting
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
our local schools with high quality
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
instructional materials represa Murray
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you while we're on that I was
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
curious about it and we've heard about
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
this program before um I guess three
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
things I've reached out to several
 
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
school districts and teachers they've
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
never heard of it and so it's a little
 
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
hard for me to hear you say that
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
everybody's using it and loving it um I
 
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.990 align:start position:0%
everybody's using it and loving it um I
also

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
some of the reviews you know I have to
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
say the reviews are wonderful in the
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
marketing but they're always going to be
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
wonderful in the marketing so I was
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
looking at other reviews of students of
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
teachers who have used it and said it
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
seemed great at first um but after
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
trying out with my students not so much
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
the lessons are very open-ended and rely
 
00:26:49.389 --> 00:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
on self-motivated students um and it
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
goes on from there um there was another
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
review inconsistent quality of content
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
overwhelming amount of resources making
 
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
it difficult to navigate occasional
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
issue with um streaming um too
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
open-ended for a lot of their students
 
00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:05.799 align:start position:0%
results in poor work life balance and so
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
um I found a fair number of reviews that
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
don't like it and as I and I also
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
reached out to RMC research I'm a large
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
research organization and ask them you
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
know their feelings about it and and ask
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
them to spread it into a wider you know
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
there are a whole lot of people who do
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
educational research and they came back
 
00:27:26.909 --> 00:27:26.919 align:start position:0%
with a n you know with they're we're not
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about it so I have
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
questions of its efficacy uh questions
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
that when I've reached out to school
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
districts they said we we don't even
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
know what that is so I'm happy to
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
respond to those and I think that those
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
are great questions and I appreciate you
 
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
bringing those up um so first of all I
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
can tell you I didn't see every teacher
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
but every school is using it um we do
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
what's interesting is that we have some
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
school leaders who have uh not
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily embraced and I'm thinking of
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
one District in particular School
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
leaders like no we're good here we don't
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
need this but I have teachers in those
 
00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:04.519 align:start position:0%
schools in the very schools where I've
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
got school leaders are telling me not so
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
much I have teachers who are accessing
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
the program signed in and using those
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
resources in their classrooms today um
 
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not surprised that you could find
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
some reviews that are not that great
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
when you have over a million and a half
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
engagements anybody if I go to Google
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
and I look for uh you know any products
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
that's got a million and a half
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
engagements I'm going to find some
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
people are kind of like me I don't know
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
now and and if you think about the the
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh the nature of those um particular
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
reviews um you know it wasn't like this
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
is lousy it was kind of like oh it was a
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
little open-ended I didn't really like
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
it it didn't work as well for my student
 
00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
population um you know so I I'm not I'm
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
not overly concerned because I can tell
 
00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.519 align:start position:0%
you that overwhelmingly both in the
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as well as I've
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
got colleagues uh you know across the
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
country who are using this platform who
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
also support educator satisfaction and
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
and a benefit associated with it um and
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
often times what's happening is in
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
particular those schools that have less
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
than robust curricular materials as you
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
know the curricular materials are the
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the local districts
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
and some districts are better fitted and
 
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
than others but those teachers that are
 
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
in the districts are finding that these
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
resources are what is uh is helpful for
 
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
them so I'm not surprised that out of a
 
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
million and a half engagements just in
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that's not or
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
anything that you would find some
 
00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
individuals who are less than satisfied
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
but um the fact that I've got this and I
 
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
can guarantee that I have a deployed in
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
every single school there's at least one
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
teacher and I don't know of anybody
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
places just one but more than one who
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
are using the tool on a regular basis so
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay I have a question um so none of
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
these on the governor's budget is that
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
accurate uh correct these were our
 
00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs y um the next item is
 
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
State Testing um and so uh you may be
 
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with this or not but in uh so
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
under the the federal assessment regime
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
as well as then translates into the
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
state federal regime we assess students
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
in um you know math and English and
 
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
Science in grades 3 through eight and
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
once in high school and essentially what
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
that does is we so we're in we're
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
assessing them in grades three through
 
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
eight and then we kind of have this Gap
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
and we assess them kind of in you know
 
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
the March time frame as of in 11th grade
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
and we see how they are performing um
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
and so that is almost too late right
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
because at that point in time if a
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
student is not in good shape if a
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
student has fallen behind um we don't
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity necessary to catch
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
them up now the schools have a many um
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
you know uh formative type of assessment
 
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
tools that they're using in their uh in
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
their curricular materials uh and in
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
their their school systems on a regular
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
basis but what this is is would we we
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
would administer a PSAT in 10th Grade
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
right so you would either n9th or 10th
 
00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
grade we would basically so we do the
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
sat in 11th grade this would be the they
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
called the P sat the preliminary sat um
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
and it would allow us to get a bead on
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
kids uh so you get to see more of a
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
straight line because otherwise I
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
basically I get to high school and I
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
have one data point in terms of your
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
performance for a student uh so
 
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
difficult to see kind of how the
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
students are making progress in that
 
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
system so so that's these are the
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs that we have have laid
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
out for
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
you um the next thing is I uh hb2
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
changes and so I've got a separate
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
handout for you relative to hp2 changes
 
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
um these are fairly granular so I will
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to hit some of the highlights
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
associated with it um this includes both
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh policy things but mostly it's it's
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
comprised of technical changes it's a
 
00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
document in your handout packet that
 
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
this sideways spreadsheet did you
 
00:31:59.950 --> 00:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
provide that one as an as a PDF do you
 
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
know what the name of it was is it says
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
house bill to Department of
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
Education I have that but you have did
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
you send the PDF of that it's at it's in
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
the back of the presentation document so
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
the P pass the presentation keep
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
scrolling in the PDF if you're in the
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
you so then you'll see like item number
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
one is I we just talked about that this
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
is that 10th grade assessment for the PS
 
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
sat um item number two is uh the um
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
language that would modify the
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
efas uh in terms of eligibility for efas
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
a policy discussion that we could
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
probably have all day if you want to um
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
item number three is part of the
 
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
adequacy calculation this is some of the
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
stuff that's really just simplifying so
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
in statute right now basically I do the
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
adequacy calculation based on the Boi
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the year um and then in
 
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
April I do an update to that based on
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
changes that have taken place and it's
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
really meaningless exercise it um in the
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
sense that the school districts at that
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
point have already set their budgets it
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't really change all that much so
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
we're suggesting that we just have we we
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
do the assess we do the uh count at the
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year and we base our
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
adequacy on that number um you know
 
00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
which just basically aligns to the
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
districts as well and and some of these
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
changes are possible now because we have
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
a Statewide student information system
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
um we didn't used to have one of those
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
we do now have one and we've gone live
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
with that and so we have better data so
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
the schools can have better data so you
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
can have better data in terms of
 
00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
understanding what's going on um item
 
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
number four is just fixing some of the
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh the the language around the episodes
 
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
of treatment that we talked about um and
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
again that was a fairly substantive uh
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
change that took place um excuse me yeah
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
I don't number one you'd like the
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
changes to uh language if you will even
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
if you don't get the funding is that
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
what that note states there correct okay
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so we really need to get
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
in other words like we can do the work
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
that we have but basically you know we
 
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
when we did episodes of treatment we
 
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
changed a whole bunch of laws both our
 
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
laws as well as HHS and we found there's
 
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
a reference that doesn't it's a missing
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
reference to the episodes of treatment
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know we're able to execute the law
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
but we're just clean these are cleanup
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
kinds of things
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
so um you know there's a technical
 
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
correction on the sped Aid uh you know
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of the we can use the actual
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
cost for that um another technical
 
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
correction um you know relative to the
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
calculations uh
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know lease Aid I'm trying to think
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
if there's anything kind of substantive
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to um you know item number
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
nine is we talked about the assessment
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
for the Naturalization assessment that
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
people are you know students are
 
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
required to pass for going through high
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
school so we just want to make sure that
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
they go through that portal um to to
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
take care of their uh that
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
assessment um the uh item number 10 is
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
just clarifying the average daily
 
00:34:56.109 --> 00:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
membership so we basically apply a
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
formula for vac in terms of how do we
 
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:00.680 align:start position:0%
allocate adequacy dollars to them we
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure and the law it's
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
the law is there but the law is a little
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
bit not it's a little bit open-ended
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
it's a little vague so we've been
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
applying a methodology for the past 20
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
years and we just think that let's just
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
tune up the law and make sure that the
 
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
law shows exactly what we're doing um
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
you know dispute resolution uh we
 
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
basically in special education are
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
required to do a a desal audit of that
 
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
but we're going we've now gone through
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
two uh LBA Audits and we'd like instead
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
of to do like state law requires me
 
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
every 10 years to do an audit of special
 
00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:32.599 align:start position:0%
education since I've already been
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
through two in the last three years I
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
just assume let those count as the audit
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
for that if possible otherwise we'll uh
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
go out and contract it will cost us
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
$100,000 we'll have to go out and
 
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
contract with somebody to do that
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise but I don't know if it's
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
necessary um item number 12 is uh we've
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
got the uh computer science professional
 
00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
development program that I had mentioned
 
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
that onetime funding that we had it was
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
non-aps funding uh we were approached by
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
the university system to try and offer
 
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh high school students the opportunity
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
to earn um High uh college credits while
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
they're in high school like we do with
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
the community college so now the
 
00:36:10.589 --> 00:36:10.599 align:start position:0%
postsecondary system would also be
 
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
joining into that through CPS over at uh
 
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
the University of system of New
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire system um and so this would
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
help to fund some of that
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
um uh 13 for I'm just
 
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
see uh so the uh item 14 is the these
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
are public school infrastructure fund
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
grants these are the security or the
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
safety grants uh the way that those work
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
right now is like we have uh we have a
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure committee
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
it's made up of a it's a legislative
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh they meet periodically we
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
open up Grant windows we receive all
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
these Grant applications and then we
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
process those grants out this is an
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to just expedite that
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
process to get those grants out um we
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
always have fully granted everything out
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
and we give schools a certain amount of
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
time to use those funds the funds that
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
don't get used we have a waiting list
 
00:36:58.829 --> 00:36:58.839 align:start position:0%
list that the public school
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund has has approved
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
that allows us like okay so say somebody
 
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
got approved for a $50,000 Grant they
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
spend $40,000 so I got $10,000 left I
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
just go to my next list on next item on
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
the ranking on my weight list and I
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate it this would allow us to
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
just directly make those Appropriations
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
to the weight listed um the the I the
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
schools on the weit list approved by the
 
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure committee
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
so it's not like the Department's doing
 
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
this it's the public school
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is approved that so we
 
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
would bypass uh fiscal and just go um
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
you know be able to make those grants to
 
00:37:30.359 --> 00:37:31.430 align:start position:0%
you know be able to make those grants to
those

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
schools uh 15 was a uh cell phone policy
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
grant that was included in the
 
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
governor's budget so those that is some
 
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 language um that we have
 
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.390 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 language um that we have
been

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
seeking represent Murray yeah thank you
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh just quickly to go back I think we'll
 
00:37:50.349 --> 00:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
be going over this again at some point U
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
then where I assume
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
right um this special education dispute
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
resolution um you know the audit wasn't
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
so tell me what number was it um it's 11
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
11 um the audit report wasn't very
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
good and I would have questions about
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
having that reviewed every 10 years when
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
we have kind of a blistering review of
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
the situation now it seems that would
 
00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
make some sense to have a more current
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
review given the problems that were
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
listed in the audit yeah so I mean if
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
you want to change the you know the
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
every 10 years to every five years
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's fine if you want to do that my
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
concern is is that we just finished that
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
and so then if this year I do that and I
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
have another ongoing audit as well so
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
then if I then have to do another one
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
you may not get the benefits that you're
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
seeking which is kind of a more periodic
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
look at this as opposed to cramming
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
everything into once and then we don't
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
look at it for again for 10 years so um
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
if you were to change the law that says
 
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
do it every five years something like
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
that that may make more sense yeah I
 
00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
guess I would like to you know given
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
that their identified problems see
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
progress in addressing those problems
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than in 10 years so all of
 
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
those have been addressed you know that
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
we're required under these AUD to go to
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and we've gone to
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and closed out all of
 
00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:05.870 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and closed out all of
those

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.230 align:start position:0%
those
issues

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
so okay then the last thing as a my
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
overview that I wanted to provide for
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
you is just kind of give you a sense as
 
00:39:16.119 --> 00:39:17.550 align:start position:0%
you is just kind of give you a sense as
to

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
positions um you have this
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
document in there and so what I have
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
done is I've gone through uh every
 
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
single position is open and or unfilled
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
um and I think that there are some
 
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
positions many of which are federally
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
funded some of which are uh generally
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
funded that we can eliminate at this
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
point in time um if I need to come back
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
to fiscal to get those positions
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
established again I can go ahead and do
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
that um many of those positions are uh
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know associated with um you know
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
Federal programs specifically uh some
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
Vocational Rehabilitation some DDS
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
positions um what's been really
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
interesting is that for DDS over the
 
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
years since I've been here we've added
 
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
positions to DDS almost everybody own
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
budget I think at this point right um
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
because the FED because as I tell people
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
it's because we did a good job and so
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
the feds are saying can you do can you
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
hire more people can you do more work um
 
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
what's interesting and and you'll see
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
that they we had initially asked for 10
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
additional DDS positions because Social
 
00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:21.079 align:start position:0%
Security Administration asked us to do
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
those um we are asking that those now be
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
removed from our budget we don't want
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
those 10 positions only only because
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
there is so much it's so tentative
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
relative to whether or not Social
 
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
Security is going to ultimately fund
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
that or not they have not they asked us
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
in the last budget to fund a bunch of
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
positions and or to add a bunch of
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
positions and get ready for capacity but
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
they haven't fully funded those even so
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
until they fully meet their obligations
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
and fully fund the stuff they've given
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
us I don't see a need to add this to the
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
budget and knowing that I always always
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to come to fiscal
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
and to resolve a problem that way um so
 
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
there's a number of positions there that
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
have uh that can be abolished but then
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
there a number of positions that we have
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
that are not filled that absolutely need
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
to be there in order to be able to
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
execute the mission um I think as many
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
of you know it's difficult to find uh
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
you know it's not that easy to recruit
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
people uh in the state and we do our
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
best um but a couple that I want to flag
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
for you that I want to ensure that I
 
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
cannot afford uh to lose these positions
 
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
so two are um you know 43257 and 4 3828
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
which are at the bottom um and this is
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
our uh Bureau of opportunities uh which
 
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
has oversight for programs our
 
00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
non-public school programs um as well as
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
our home education programs so we've got
 
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
you know it's all the way second third
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
up from the bottom we've got 24,000
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
students in these programs and we have
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
you know like this is not like a
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
situation where we're you know missing
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
one out of a team of people we have one
 
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
person who administers these programs
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
that person took another job in the
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
department uh doing school building and
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
so that position is currently open and
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
so uh right now Caitlyn and I uh you
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
know meet the needs of that program um
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
and then as well the education Freedom
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
account uh administrator moved into
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
another role at Dees and so that
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
position is open as well um again an
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
important program an important program
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
to administer well um and so we would
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
ask again there's no other there's not
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
like there's a team of people there
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
there's one person administering that
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
program and so that went absolutely
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
needs to be administered um and the two
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
other that I'm going to flag for you in
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.589 --> 00:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
hire those individuals internally
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
because they um you know I think that
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
those they're they're important people
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
to managing the student data um but
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
we're getting good service from our
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
contractor so I'm not complaining about
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
that but I do we had these positions
 
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:12.559 align:start position:0%
previously and I think that we we
 
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:14.839 align:start position:0%
continue to to want them to be part of
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
that team but um you know if I can't
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
find them I can't find them I still got
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
to get the work done so we did a
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
contract for that um and so those with
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
that I will uh pause take any other
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
questions and then I know that uh my
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
team stands ready to answer any
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
questions that people might have thank
 
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
you uh representa Murray thank you I'm
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
just awfully curious at the bottom of
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
it's um 1319 who gets the
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
chauffeur yeah I said the same thing
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
right so that is directly um for the
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner to for me to be able to get
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
over here to the state house and back
 
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.390 align:start position:0%
over here to the state house and back
I'm

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
kidding she's like
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
what no that is just the state
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
description of the position but
 
00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:55.559 align:start position:0%
essentially it is in our blind Services
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh division so individ ual who are
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
visually impaired uh we are able to
 
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
support them sometimes to be able to get
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
them to doctor's appointments and and uh
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
stuff like that so
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so is that a person is that a phys
 
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
or is that something you would call Uber
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh so um Uber isn't always able to work
 
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
with somebody who's visually impaired um
 
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
so basically it is a position that we
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
have um and we um are able to staff and
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
and keep them busy um if we can't then
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
we won't you know staff it but it's
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
you'd be surprised how busy it can be
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
yeah a lot of doctor's appointments
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
represent D are those for students or
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
are those for your the staff no not for
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
the staff these are for our clients of
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
vocation Rehabilitation so vocation
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation provides um you know job
 
00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
counseling job coaching and supports to
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
individuals in the state of New
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire between the ages of 14 and end
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
of life uh who have disabilities um and
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
so some of those individuals
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know have disabilities and are
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
not able to get to a job interview or
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
not able to get to a critical doctor's
 
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
appointment or something like that and
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
so we're able to support them in that
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
way did I do okay with that that's yeah
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
representative haen Phillips thank you
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you be for being with us
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
this morning Mr commissioner um I'm just
 
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
interested to hear more about um number
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
six on your house bill
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
two uh spread sheet the technical
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
correction to adequacy quote unquote
 
00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.630 align:start position:0%
correction to adequacy quote unquote
Factor

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
Factor
 
00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
like Caitlyn can you come forward please
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
mic stay back there as long as I
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
can exactly when I leave they're like oh
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
my God so um that is literally left over
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
from Old Law so there used to be a
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal disparity Grant in the formula
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
and that was removed and combined in the
 
00:45:55.549 --> 00:45:55.559 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant but the word
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
factor and that definition of factor was
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
just left in the definitions and it's
 
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
not no longer used throughout the
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula so we thought it' be
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
law representative Murray thank you
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
again I imagine we'll be going through
 
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
this and we go through the line by line
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
but um just in general with regards to
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
the positions that to be abolished it
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
said by and large their Federal
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
positions and I noticed that there are a
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
lot of programs in the budget um that it
 
00:46:32.349 --> 00:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
appears that a Federal grant is no
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
longer continued and I assume some of
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
these positions um have something to do
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
with the fact that that Grant doesn't
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
exist anymore I'm not sure which Grant
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
you're referring to well I mean there
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
are there's a where' my budget go so the
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
only one is we have the system of care
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
Grant but is there another one that
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
you're referring to there's we go
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
through it we can get to it I'm just
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
curious um with regards to the federal
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
positions um why aren't they needed any
 
00:46:59.309 --> 00:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
more um and I appreciate that it is
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
federal in that but my just when I went
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
through the budget I'm wondering is
 
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
there money that's being left at the
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
federal table that should come to us
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
because I see an awful lot of grants
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
that are no longer being funded yeah so
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
the the federal is driven principally by
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
DDS and by VR positions and so what
 
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
you'll find in VR is again it's a bureau
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
that has about 80 positions in it um it
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
is a bureau that experiences turnover
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
the nature of the work is such that
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
there's turnover and essentially what
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
happens is you look at like what I did
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
is I looked at like the last dat I
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
posted these things and some of these
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
haven't been posted for a while and the
 
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
reason they haven't been posted for a
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
while is because we lost another
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
position so we just reposted that one
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
and so I guess what I would say is given
 
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
what we see as the movement through
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
there I have enough positions to satisfy
 
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
my ability to fill the people that I can
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
find um and so I think I I know that
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
this is a tough year and you guys are
 
00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
looking for a position so I think I can
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
live without that and I'm not leaving
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
any grant money on the table right so
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
we've not lapsed any grants back
 
00:47:59.069 --> 00:47:59.079 align:start position:0%
and again on the Social Security
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
Disability same kind of a thing it's uh
 
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
you know at least a cohort of those
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
employees are just they're processors
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
right they're just processing all day
 
00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
long so you find turn over in there but
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
what happens is somebody turns over we
 
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
Poe that position we don't go back and
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
grab the old position and post it so I
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
have enough positions available to be
 
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
able to keep my Staffing at an
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
operational level so
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
y represent of hacka Philips yeah I'm
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr I'm curious about um the
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
move of putting the office of
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
Commissioners funding which used to be
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
derived from the general fund into the
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund under the proposed
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
budget and I'm particularly concerned
 
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
given that the governor's budget already
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
drains the total of the education trust
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
fund by the end of 27 so I'm just
 
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
wondering why we're shuffling more
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
expenses into the education trust can
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
you point out what you're referring to
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand what you're
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I think it's in
 
00:49:03.789 --> 00:49:03.799 align:start position:0%
hb1 um the office of the commissioner
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
used to be funded by the general fund
 
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
but under the proposal it it would now
 
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
be funded through the education trust
 
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
fund I'm not sure that's correct so if
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
you can point that out I'm still I hope
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
that's right okay great yeah I'm
 
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
generally funded and my office is
 
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.870 align:start position:0%
generally funded and my office is
generally

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
funded most days not every day huh I do
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
a good job I
 
00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:29.799 align:start position:0%
generally section that proposes it is
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
section 18 of the of hb2 oh in the
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
budget to is also on
 
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
1075 um we take a look at that you want
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
to take a look I'm looking at it right
 
00:49:44.789 --> 00:49:44.799 align:start position:0%
now Office of the commissioner is on
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
page 1073 of the budget then I'm looking
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
um so the educ and then you see the line
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
you see the before that it's now I
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
understand you guys are asking hang on
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
yeah the $5 million is for the public
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
1072 so that is coming out of the
 
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is the public
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure those are those
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
security grants that we talked
 
00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
about but I don't believe we have any of
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
administrative stuff that's stuck in
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
there chairman could I comment yes sorry
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
so for many years the education trust
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
fund just funded
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
adequacy and when we left at the budget
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
the previous that's what we' done we
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
corrected it to just fund adequacy then
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
the Senate screwed it all up and and
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
they went from they doubled the amount
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
of money going from business taxes to
 
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
the education Trust fund which left us
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
with a huge Surplus which meant we had
 
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
money tied up we couldn't use anywhere
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
else it was poor planning it was a lousy
 
00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
um mistake and I wasn't allowed to
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
discuss it in the committee of
 
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
conference because we didn't have one so
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
this year we're going to go back to just
 
00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
funding adequacy and education trust
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
fund and it gives us more flexibility
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
for what we do with General funds which
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
all these other things that Frank
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
remembers were funded by General funds
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go back to that
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
pattern again so we have more
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
flexibility thank
 
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:31.640 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
00:51:34.349 --> 00:51:34.359 align:start position:0%
D I'm brand new to this so forgive me if
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
I ask a stupid question there's no
 
00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:37.150 align:start position:0%
I ask a stupid question there's no
stupid

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
stupid
 
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
questions in your budgets you have all
 
00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
these positions that have been there
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
some of them have been there since long
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
time yeah each year are those funded and
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
if they are where did all of that money
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
go because they you weren't able to be
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
able to hire people yeah so generally
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
they are appropriated some of them are
 
00:51:59.069 --> 00:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
funded many of them are not funded and
 
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
so there's no reason to carry them
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
forward they would only be funded if for
 
00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
example somebody turned over and then I
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
had surplus funds then I would be able
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
to hire that position but what I find is
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
that I can turn over a certain number a
 
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
smaller number of positions and keep the
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
operation moving so some are funded many
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
are not funded but all are appropriated
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
you anybody else and then we're happy to
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
do the line by line and I've got a crack
 
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
team behind me who's just itching to get
 
00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
up here and answer your
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
questions are you going to be
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
disappearing I wasn't yes exact unless
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%

questions please feel free to give me a
call

00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.119 --> 00:53:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.430 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
cool thank you if you um are you
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
planning to uh you know kind of start
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
going through the lines uh and give us a
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
bit of color and maybe we'll we'll start
 
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
asking questions as needed or would you
 
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
rather do it in another way whatever you
 
00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:35.720 align:start position:0%
whatever suits you we can go through it
 
00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
line by line account by account if we
 
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
could and just obviously focus on what
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
matters and uh provide a little bit of
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
color so we understand any variance any
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
changes in there uh you know so we save
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
the inevitable questions okay thank you
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
so our budget starts on page 1071 of the
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
governor's phase
 
00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
um in the very first account that we're
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
looking at that's the public school
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so you'll see that the
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
zeros and then we go up to the $5
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
million which is on the next page and
 
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
that is because as the commissioner
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
discussed we received $10 million from
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
23 surplus funds so that $10 million did
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
not show up in house bill one in this
 
00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:23.799 align:start position:0%
document in front of you is just House
 
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
Bill one that's why you don't see the
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
$10 million and that $5 million is
 
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
education trust funds unless it gets
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
discussing the next account is the
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner's account and if you look
 
00:54:44.589 --> 00:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
down on page 1073 that is generally
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
been yeah I just have a question because
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at hb2 and there is a um
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
question to amend RSA 198 col 39 Roman
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
numeral 1 to include funding the
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Education operating costs
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
within budgeted
 
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
Appropriations as subsection R so I'm
 
00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:12.870 align:start position:0%
Appropriations as subsection R so I'm
just

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
wondering uh if the commissioner's
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
office is currently funded with General
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
funds what is the purpose of the request
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
to change the education trust fund can I
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
just ask what page you're on in the BB2
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
um this was the old hb2 page 54 I don't
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
have the new one in front of me
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
yet what's the title how about that um
 
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
that is a modification of the current
 
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
law so the current law says so if
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
expenditures to administer programs
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
funded on the education trust fund P
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
pursuant to paragraph one exceeds
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate amounts the commissioner May
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
request of fiscal the general court um
 
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
additional funding and blah blah blah so
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
that is the existing law the governor's
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
office modified the existing law to what
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
is funded there however we do have the
 
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
authority to fund certain operation
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
operational costs at the Department of
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
Education through the education trust
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
fund right
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
now I'm Happ let you continue but can
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
you just tell me where we are in hb2 um
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
anything does it have a name or a
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
so what what that is though is the
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
department does have the authority to go
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
to fiscal right now to ask for
 
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
additional cost associated with
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
administering programs so not additional
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
costs associated with their program so
 
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't if we needed additional
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
money for say building Aid we couldn't
 
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
go to fiscal to do that however we if we
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
needed um additional funds to administer
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
the building aid program we could go to
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal to ask that that eliminates that
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
down essentially and takes the
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
Department's Authority away for us to go
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal it's it's it's restricting the
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
Department's Authority so for those
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
watching at home I believe it's section
 
00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
me okay Kaitlin I'm so sorry it's
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
probably the fact that I've been up
 
00:57:21.309 --> 00:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
since 4 a.m could you say that one more
 
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
time so yeah so RSA
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
19839 currently and of course I don't
 
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
have HB two proposals in front of me I
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
have the current law but um the current
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
law allows the Department of Education
 
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
to go to fiscal to ask for additional
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
funds to administer the education trust
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
fund um so this is one of those things
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
that over the years uh the legislature
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
has added additional programs to the
 
00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
education trust fund without granting
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
the department the administrative um
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
ability to or the without granting the
 
00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
department additional funds to
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
administer those programs and so two
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
years ago or two budget Cycles ago the
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
department asked the legislature to give
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
us the authority to ask you if you are
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
putting a new fund or a new program or
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
expanding a new program if we could have
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
the authority to request additional
 
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
funds to operate that program um and it
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
was determined that we could come to
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal to ask for that Authority that's
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
what's in current law so let me give you
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
a good example of this so we have the
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
charter school program the charter
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
school program is administered um or
 
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:21.799 align:start position:0%
charter school funding is in the
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
education trust fund we may need for
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
example an addition additional person to
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
oversee charter school funding we had
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually had some internal conversations
 
00:58:32.589 --> 00:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
even about requesting an additional
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
position um to provide additional fiscal
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
oversight relative to Charter Schools
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
this was a conversation that came up
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
last spring when we had two charter
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
schools closed in the middle of the year
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
and and there was thoughts about
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
additional oversight what the Department
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
of Education could do right now in
 
00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:53.039 align:start position:0%
current law is we could request an
 
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
additional position or funding from FIS
 
00:58:59.470 --> 00:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
SCH to do that additional oversight um
 
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
and use education trust fund dollars to
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
do that because the charter school
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
funding program itself is in the
 
00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
education trust fund this modification
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
here takes that Authority away the
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
department did not request that um in
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
hb2 I was surprised when I saw an hb2 um
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
but that that removes that Authority
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
Department can I ask a followup yeah
 
00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.270 align:start position:0%
Department can I ask a followup yeah
absolutely

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
um so um maybe I'm
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding um so apologize I
 
00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
apologize if that's the case um we know
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
that there are like three open warrants
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
currently in the trust funds so like
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
building Aid I or no I'm so sorry um
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
Charters um quarter Replacements there's
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
another one I'm sorry I'm blanking
 
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:51.640 align:start position:0%
charter schools efas and qu plac yeah so
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
are you saying that if we agree to this
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
change that it would limit the
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
Department's authority to to go to
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal to ask for that no so the
 
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
department right now so the um the
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
language that I spoke of that's in the
 
01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:06.039 align:start position:0%
current law the department has to go to
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal to ask for the additional funds
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
for that for the ones that we have the
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
warrant language on we don't need to go
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
to fiscal we just write basically a
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
letter to the treasurer's office asking
 
01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
them to appr um increase appropriation
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
um to pay those lines the warrant
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
Authority that we have is specific in
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
the programs that are established so if
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
look at how adequacy is established it
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
then um talks about the formula and then
 
01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:32.039 align:start position:0%
it says the department has warrant
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
Authority same with education Freedom
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
accounts it talks about the formula and
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
all the program and then it has um the
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
warrant Authority um so there is not any
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
warrant Authority on um say building Aid
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
so we couldn't ask for additional
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
Authority for that um for that building
 
01:00:52.829 --> 01:00:52.839 align:start position:0%
Aid the department done then on top of
 
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
all of the programs has operational
 
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
costs associated with operating those
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
programs we have a building Aid
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
administrator we have a charter school
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
administrator right now the current law
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
allows us if you know if needed if the
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
department felt needed we could go to
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal to ask for those additional
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to expand our operating
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
costs associated with those programs and
 
01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
so hb2 as the governor's office has
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
proposed removes the Department's
 
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
that can I are you okay or so I want to
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
follow up with what she was just asking
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like you don't have this in
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
front of you the hb2 because I'm curious
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
where in this section it's removing that
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
Authority that you're talking about um
 
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
so it uh there's a bunch of things in
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
here right so what it does it's um it's
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund um section do
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
you have it printed I have what you gave
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
me but I don't I do not have it give me
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
my I'll computer
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
oh I don't even see anything about the
 
01:01:51.789 --> 01:01:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
fund you're talk represent hack and
 
01:01:54.319 --> 01:01:57.430 align:start position:0%
fund you're talk represent hack and
Phillips

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about a a section that
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
has the title adequate education
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
education trust fund amend RSA 198 colum
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
39 comma blah blah blah do you see
 
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
anything in there about the education
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
trust fund that's what I'm trying to
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
about give me it it says page 55 um like
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
says page 55 I don't know that it's PDF
 
01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:28.990 align:start position:0%
says page 55 I don't know that it's PDF
page

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
55 page 55
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
yeah read what you're reading and in
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
it's um letter r it says to fund the
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
Department's operation costs within
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
budgeted Appropriations okay which
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't match mention education trust
 
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
fund just to be clear um so this section
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
is specifically so it's um on page 54
 
01:02:52.349 --> 01:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
the line before um row 26 so this is the
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
RSA that establishes the education trust
 
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
fund it's RSA 1
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
9839 okay so that that line that says to
 
01:03:02.269 --> 01:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
fund Department of Education operating
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
costs within budgeted Appropriations is
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
taking taking away an authority from you
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
is that what I'm to understand um we
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
believed it to do that we haven't had
 
01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:11.559 align:start position:0%
any discussions relative we saw in this
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
too and we haven't had any additional
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
discussions of you know what the
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
intention of that was but we felt that
 
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
that was what the um purpose of that was
 
01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:20.839 align:start position:0%
and what Authority is it taking away
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
just the authority that we currently
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
have under RSA 18938
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
3 but in in plain language what
 
01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
Authority um if required expenditure if
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
required expenditures to administer
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
programs funded by the education trust
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
fund pursuant to paragraph 1 exceeds
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
amount appropriated the commissioner of
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
Education May request fiscal May request
 
01:03:47.309 --> 01:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
the fiscal Committee of the general
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
court authorize additional funding
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
amounts requested under this paragraph
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
fund does everybody else understand that
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
how that's are moving Authority yeah I
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:08.839 align:start position:0%
the well I think the impact would be
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
that if if in fact as the governor's
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
budget proposed that
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund was emptied by
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
the end of the 27th bium that we would
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
not be able to go and ask for the
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to be backfilled is
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
Mickey can you provide any context can I
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
take a try maybe that might help so I
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
don't I don't have the house bill to in
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
front of me but that statute that's
 
01:04:40.349 --> 01:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
being amended is the permissible usage
 
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
under statute of using education trust
 
01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
funds yeah so what House Bill 2 adds
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
this is just my interpretation I haven't
 
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
talked to the department yet about this
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
it just adds a couple permissible usage
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
including to fund education operating
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
costs within budget Appropriations so
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
they would still be a limit to Authority
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
granted to the Department of how much
 
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund they could use
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
for operating but this just statutorily
 
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
makes it compliant as a possible use so
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
when I when I look at like for instance
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
2196 ETF
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
Administration on page 1171 of their
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
operating budget so from this account
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
they have a position budgeted so to me
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
this house bill two language would make
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
it so that's permissible
 
01:05:29.269 --> 01:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
do you agree that is that's correct I
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
that Roman three so so say again
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
reference the hb1 again so in house bill
 
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
one accounting unit 2196 on page
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
1171 is relative and the department can
 
01:05:41.549 --> 01:05:41.559 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit more about what this
 
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
position does but there is some
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
operating costs relative to uh ETF here
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
so to me this house bill two section
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
that adds an allowable use of the ETF
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
for operating costs I view it to apply
 
01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
to perhap perhaps making this compliant
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
um relative to the Department's
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
authority to come to fiscal to ask for
 
01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
additional funds if it exceeds their
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
budget amount that's Roman three which
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
is not changed by this house bill too um
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
there could be I think what the
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
department is interpreting that any
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
operating cost would be bound by
 
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
budgeted Appropriations therefore they
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't come to fiscal uh I can tell
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
you that based on what representative
 
01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
wer has has talked about plus whatever
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
this committee does we are going to
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
completely probably rewrite this statute
 
01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
so what's in House Bill 2 now uh you can
 
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
take it as you know we're still trying
 
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
to work through it but ultimately we
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
will probably have an amendment in this
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
division to align with how you fund the
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
Education so right now what I'm hearing
 
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
that this is more additive it's not more
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
restrictive it's adding additional
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
authority to go to well the authority to
 
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
go to fiscal still exists I believe this
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
I think the intent was trying to just
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
add more permissible usage you know the
 
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
cell phone uh policy for instance and
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
then adding anything else for Department
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
operating costs but within budgeted
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
Appropriations making it clear like it's
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
still going to be bound by what you
 
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate but as an allowable use but
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
like I said we will completely revisit
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
and probably re rewrite this amendment
 
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
and and over write it with something
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
from this division in the coming days or
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
weeks thank
 
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:23.799 align:start position:0%
you so I kind of left the room there to
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
use the restroom what did we jump into
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
doing hb2 is that where we are
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
no no that's okay I just okay so we're
 
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:34.839 align:start position:0%
actually one page in we went okay
 
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
perfect you are out for one minute I
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
mean I thought I was quick but
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
enough so I before we get started here
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
on this just to give you a heads up in
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
terms of what I need um as we move
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
through this wake up um I don't I'm not
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
really looking at the PDF I'm actually
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
looking at your budget so when you make
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
it when you make references to PDF page
 
01:08:00.269 --> 01:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
numbers or actual page numbers whatever
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
you want to do over there would you also
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
reference account numbers because that's
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
where I'm searching for over here
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
sure so we had left off on discussing
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
account 6001 which is the
 
01:08:15.669 --> 01:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that is generally
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
funded um and I just I'll go through it
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
unless you have questions and stop me um
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
the next account is our
 
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
6165 the unemployment compensation that
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
is you know mandatory that we fund that
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
along with the unemployment compensation
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
or I said that already what's the next
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
8062 that ends the commissioner's
 
01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
Division and as you know it is funded
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
generally funded as well as the
 
01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
the next is the office of the Deputy
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioner our first account is human
 
01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:04.070 align:start position:0%
Commissioner our first account is human
resources

01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
unit I think I'm okay and you can still
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
also reference the page numbers in one
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
for everybody else okay that's on 10
 
01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.590 align:start position:0%
for everybody else okay that's on 10
page

01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
1076 repr Murray yeah can you just
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit there um it's one
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
position left uh so it's you went from
 
01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
three positions down to
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
two um and I see the Personnel line
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
going down in benefits but you've have
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
you hired it looks like you've hired
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
a temp person or temp appointee on 50
 
01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
the line 50 can you just speak to the
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
shuffling around so we unfunded a
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
full-time position and moved the
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
available funds into the class 50 so
 
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
investigator okay I have a f um Mr chair
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh I'm looking at
 
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
line I guess uh 102 contracts for
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
program services that um expenditure is
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
grown exponentially could you give us a
 
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
little explanation of what's going on
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
there I
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
can so we've had um
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
expenses rise over the last few years we
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
have our Brody law contract that we need
 
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
to do for the title 9ine
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
requirements we have ever law which is
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
our right to no software that software
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
are we need for redaction and that seems
 
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
to be increasing we started out with
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
like a $50,000 contract we're up to
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
$80,000 and the more right to knows that
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
we get the more that it expands that
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
contract expands so that's why we the
 
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
increasing the um line 235 transcription
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
Services has also gone up is that also
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
related to right to know or is that
 
01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:18.910 align:start position:0%
related to right to know or is that
something

01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
else transcription so that is 15,000 for
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
25 and we're asking for 10,000 so this
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
actually gone down by I was looking at
 
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
sure on page
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
1077 we've gone to the preschool
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
development Grant um that has gone down
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
to zero that was a grant that we
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.709 align:start position:0%
 
usnh

01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
usnh
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
yes pass
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
through we have on 1078 we have
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
program that is funding that we receive
 
01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:08.390 align:start position:0%
program that is funding that we receive
through

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
donations on 1079 we have teacher of the

4132 and that is our teacher of the year
 
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
program where
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
we do our promotion of the
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
page

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
1080 is our 4275 that's our doit
 
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:51.310 align:start position:0%
 
management

01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
account am I going too fast too slow is
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
this okay okay
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay on 1081 we move to the deputy
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
60003 and then 10 page 1082 our in
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide agency indirect cost plan
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
64 those are funds that we collect from
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
our federal grants and pay the swi out
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
so when that references uh agency
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
indirect cost recoveries what for the
 
01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
funding source 00c what does that
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
referred to that is how we collect so
 
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
admin Services requires that we have
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
this in one accounting unit so we assess
 
01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
an indirect cost rate to all of our
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
federal programs we collect those funds
 
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
from those accounting units and dump
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
them into this accounting unit so then
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
we pay admin services from this one
 
01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
um 6006 is the teacher competence fund
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
Treasury and Page
 
01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
1084 we have our printing revolving fund
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
which is accounting unit 6530 this is
 
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
how we pay for all of our um
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
office and then on that same page is
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 7007 this is our fiscal
 
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
management unit that oversees the
 
01:14:45.149 --> 01:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
grants and that completes the office of
 
01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner or Deputy Commissioner
 
01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:53.990 align:start position:0%
the commissioner or Deputy Commissioner

sorry our next division is education
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%

want me to get the
 
01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
okay so our first account on page 108

program the next account is on page 1087
 
01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
or it starts is accounting unit 3041
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
education analytics and resources and it
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
on page 1089 we have our compliance
 
01:16:04.239 --> 01:16:06.629 align:start position:0%
on page 1089 we have our compliance
account

01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
3042 that oversees Federal compliance of
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
programs on page 1090 one moment oh I'm
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
sorry muray has a question coming
 
01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
I was keeping up for a while sorry um on
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
1089 um get my thing line
 
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
it it's coming it was General funds and
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
then there's a big increase in it and
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
now it's from Interra agency transfers
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of this fund is um or
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
sorry this this accounting unit is
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
there's three staff that oversee our
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
compliance with 2 CFR which is uh a
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
federal General guidance over all
 
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
federal grants we have a team of three
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
people that monitor uh School District's
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
compliance with that Rel and also um
 
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
assist the department with its own
 
01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
internal compliance um of to CFR
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
specifically um we spend a lot of time
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
working with KPMG and our U various
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
Auditors US Department of Education was
 
01:17:14.669 --> 01:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
here auditing us last week actually um
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
and so uh that's where those staff are
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
paid um in the past what we had done um
 
01:17:21.629 --> 01:17:21.639 align:start position:0%
we just this is really a a change in
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
accounting methodology um but we what we
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
done had done was budget them in general
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
funds and then Bild them back to federal
 
01:17:32.629 --> 01:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
funds um and so what we have because
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
there's not enough federal funds to
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
support all of the needs of that um of
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
those programs unfortunately of the of
 
01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
the compliance requirements so we've
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
just really done an accounting change so
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
instead of billing it back through class
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
10 now you'll see um throughout the
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
agency it's going to be built back
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
through class 29 which which is inter
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
agency transfers and so the general
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
funds rather than being budgeted in this
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
account are now going to be budgeted
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
with in the various different accounts
 
01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
transparent on page 1090 we have
 
01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
survey can I ask what ncees survey um
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
yeah National Center for Education
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
statistics um it's a a survey that we
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
participate in every year and they give
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
us a supplemental amount of uh funds to
 
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
cover the training of the C of the
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
sending the staff to DC to participate
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
um in essentially the training and the
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
results of that that survey
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
thanks then on page 1091 we have our
 
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
education opportunities accounting unit
 
01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:56.629 align:start position:0%
education opportunities accounting unit
3046

01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
on page 1092 we have our educational
 
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
statistics I mean my apies I'm
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
particularly interested uh this may not
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
be the correct accounting unit but I'm
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
particularly interested in uh where
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
refunds go um
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
or I'm particularly I'm thinking about
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
the audit this past summer of the
 
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom accounts um by our
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
administrator that found about 20% of
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
the audit showed inappropriate
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
um um issuance of the efas and at some
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
point some of that money was supposed to
 
01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
come back to us and I'm just wondering
 
01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
has that money come back and uh where
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
where would we see that so that those
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
funds are um there's this individual
 
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
accounting unit that education Freedom
 
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
accounts are in in this budget it's
 
01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
actually I think like the very last page
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
um so depending on how long we go today
 
01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
we'll get to that um but it previously
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
it was in was an accounting unit called
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
3054 and it was the education trust fund
 
01:19:59.950 --> 01:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
as a whole and it had individual classes
 
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
one was a building aid class was an
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
adequacy class one was an EFA class so
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
that would have been deposited directly
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
back in that class um same with that
 
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
reconciliation that um Kei Baker when
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
she was here on Friday talked about um
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
that when she talked about having that
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
liability on her um financial statements
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
that when that's refunded we we get the
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
check back from her and we deposit it
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
directly in that
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
line uh you said previously is that
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to change in the future so um
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things you'll see uh that the
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
department did um under the suggestion
 
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services is rather
 
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
than having one accounting unit with all
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
of the um individual EFA or sorry ETF
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
programs in it um admin Services
 
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
requested that we have a specific
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
accounting unit for each program within
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
and a line within each one so it clearly
 
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
shows whether it's a grant or a contract
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
or Personnel expenditures or or whatnot
 
01:20:52.719 --> 01:20:59.790 align:start position:0%
or Personnel expenditures or or whatnot
so

01:20:59.790 --> 01:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
okay on page 1092 the educational
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
3047 and then moving on to page
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
1093 is the school facilities
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
unit page 1095 four we have a federal
 
01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
3059 repres Murray thank you um getting
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
down there with 1095 so there are seven
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
positions lost are these some of the
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
positions that are listed in the um the
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
the page that edelblute submitted to us
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
no these are positions so um what we
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
have had done in the past is we has hous
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
affair number of positions in this
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
accounting unit that were actually data
 
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
support positions and then they were
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
build back to the appropriate program
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
that they oversee and so they've now
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
been moved to the appropriate accounting
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
unit and as they support Federal
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
assessment um Federal the federal
 
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
assessment Grant which this is the one
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here will pay for it
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
through a time and effort but really
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
they are in the the data group as a
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
whole now so we can really have a a
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
stronger understanding of where our data
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
are on page 1095 we go down to our New
 
01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
authority there were no funds asked for
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
that this year and then accounting unit
 
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
33000 on that same page is our youth
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
risk behavior survey those were federal
 
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
us on page
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
1096 we have accounting unit 3471 which
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.990 --> 01:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
and on page
 
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
1097 we have national forest and land
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
funds those funds are pass through funds
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
to there's a formula that is given to
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
us um so they are funds that are earned
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
Leed from um Forest activities in
 
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.149 align:start position:0%
Leed from um Forest activities in
National

01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
National
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
lands exactly so it goes so those those
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
funds go to the school districts um
 
01:23:37.629 --> 01:23:37.639 align:start position:0%
which have the national forest with them
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
I believe there's may be some in Grafton
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
well on page 1098 we have accounting
 
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
student longitudal Data
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
Systems we have to shorten accounting
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
unit titles because there's only a 30
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
character limit that we are allowed and
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
that 30 characters includes spaces
 
01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative heck Phillips I'm looking
 
01:24:31.229 --> 01:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
at line uh 102 contracts for program
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
Services we're looking out a pretty big
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
jump there could you describe what's
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
happening yes so this is a um a fouryear
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
grant um and fiscal year 24 real
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
actually fiscal year 25 is the first
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
year that we received the Federal Grant
 
01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
and then we received additional funds
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
through the next year so we're
 
01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:47.719 align:start position:0%
anticipating this grant going for three
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
more years um and it is to uh really
 
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
realign our Data Systems specifically
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
around school Finance so we're we're in
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
the process right now we have an RFP I
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
should actually say this this is a
 
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
public meeting we have an RFP out right
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
now um for uh an accounting firm to
 
01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:05.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully help the Department of
 
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
Education uh review and change its chart
 
01:25:10.109 --> 01:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
of accounts that school districts use
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
for when submitting all financial
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
reporting the current system has been
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
placed since 1999 and we're really
 
01:25:18.109 --> 01:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
hoping to have some modifications to
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
that um so there's my commercial for the
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
day um uh but um this is work that's
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
needed in New Hampshire regardless and
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're we are able to
 
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
leverage federal funds to do that work
 
01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
um hopefully those funds continue to
 
01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:33.639 align:start position:0%
flow we're not sure what's going to
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
happen with the the federal government
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
but um as of right now we're planning on
 
01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
initiative on page 1099 we have our
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 7064 State assessment
 
01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:52.229 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 7064 State assessment
and

01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
accountability um because we joined an
 
01:25:57.390 --> 01:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
additional um additional membership so
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
before we only had the state federal um
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
sorry the state assessment membership
 
01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
and we joined the state accountability
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
well represent Murray thank you um on
 
01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
612 where did State Testing get moved to
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
that was moved to its own line within
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
the um education trust fund as
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
well so it has its own accounting unit
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
on page 1100 accounting unit 7128 is
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:44.830 --> 01:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
Systems and Page 1101 is our advanced
 
01:26:50.590 --> 01:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
7374 our nape assessment is on the same
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
7375 the national National assessment
 
01:27:14.109 --> 01:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
we we have improved on
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
nape on page 1103 we have oh we
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
end our educational analytics and
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%

what does that refer to agency income
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%

credentials anything
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
else yeah um good morning Steve Appleby

the State Board of Education so those
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
are the licensing fees that the
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
Educators pay
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%

01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
9014 Murray thank you in the
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
organization notes it talks about you
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
know give an outright to assist worthy
 
01:30:18.109 --> 01:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
pupils in the state normal schools is
 
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
that something that needs to be changed
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
do we even refer to normal schools
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
anymore um I didn't have normal schools
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
growing up my mom did so thank you yeah
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
normal schools referred to Plymouth and
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
Keen um but is this the right language
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
now I mean I'm I'm sure there are people
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
who don't even know what a normal school
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
is now agreed agreed I would note um
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
that would be probably a legal question
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
because in the um these individuals left
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
money to the state and as part of that
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
trust document that's how they State
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
1111 oh we're done higher
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
red there you go thank
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
you well
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
done our next division is learner
 
01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
support I believe and that's with
 
01:31:19.709 --> 01:31:19.719 align:start position:0%
Melissa Wright as the division
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
our first accounting unit that was 1074
 
01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
that a grant that was a grant is no
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
longer with us so we'll move on to
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%

fund on page
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
State r m down the next page can you
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
speak to the cut in that program
 
01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we were required to make general
 
01:32:35.229 --> 01:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
fund cuts and in that program you'll see
 
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:42.280 align:start position:0%
down with that program we had initially
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
had put in uh for Contract Services in
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
order to have an evaluation done a
 
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive evaluation of the
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide implementation of the
 
01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
mtssb her behavior and supports and it
 
01:32:58.830 --> 01:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
was more important to prioritize the
 
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
staff that are actually going out
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
working with the schools on the
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
implementation so we did cut the the
 
01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
contract and for the evaluation and
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be able to use U
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant funds and apply for
 
01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation on page
 
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
1114 we have the school nutrition
 
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
equipment fund 2172 those are federal FS
 
01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.390 align:start position:0%
 
grant

01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
grant
 
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
11:15 we were looking to consolidate
 
01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
chose not to do that so those funds that
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
were in there for 25 have been dispersed
 
01:33:39.629 --> 01:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
back to the federal grants from which
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
they were intended to come
 
01:33:45.629 --> 01:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
from so on the same page we have
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 2322 which is our school
 
01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:50.990 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 2322 which is our school
nutrition

01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
nutrition
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
program or part of it we have many of
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
up page
 
01:34:04.350 --> 01:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
1116 you added a person there I'm sorry
 
01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
you added a person there in the
 
01:34:05.679 --> 01:34:06.910 align:start position:0%
you added a person there in the
nutrition

01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
nutrition
 
01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
program I I think what they've done is
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to align our accounts
 
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
with the federal reporting requirements
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
and so if there's a person there that
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
person has come from a prior or a
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
different School nutrition
 
01:34:29.709 --> 01:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
account every time we think that we have
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
our accounts aligned to how we can
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
report they change the
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
reports it it's
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
welcome um on a page
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
1116 2370 School climate transport that
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
that Grant went
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
2380 and so next we're at 252 digital
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
118 and where is this agency income
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
coming from this agency
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
income that was from a competitive grant
 
01:35:23.790 --> 01:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
that was uh given to the Department of
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
education many years ago for uh
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
improvements in digital literacy and so
 
01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
we've just maintained those funds to be
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
able to go out and do specific uh Grant
 
01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
work website development that type of
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
thing um to kind of help those schools
 
01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
but the the grant itself was um provided
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
to us years ago and we've just kind of
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
maintained that until the funds run out
 
01:35:51.310 --> 01:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
a f a Federal grant no this was actually
 
01:35:54.669 --> 01:35:54.679 align:start position:0%
a competitive private Grant
 
01:35:56.430 --> 01:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
what does that
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
mean so my understanding it's similar to
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
um I was thinking of the nonprofit here
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that that does a lot of
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
the grants where they um give out grants
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
for different things and I have to say
 
01:36:12.149 --> 01:36:12.159 align:start position:0%
this is before I um came to the
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so I'm a little
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
bit it's a little foggy in there New
 
01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charitable trust that's the
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
one um provided that for this work thank
 
01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:23.669 align:start position:0%
one um provided that for this work thank
you

01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.189 --> 01:36:26.199 align:start position:0%
on page 1119 we have instructional
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
253 and Page 1120 we have our special
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
2504 so is that all of the federal funds
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
that come related to special education
 
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
or the vast majority of them I that's a
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
better way to put it correct we receive
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
the 2504 is the idea funds that are for
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
K to2 and then we have 2505 which is
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
going to be the preschool idea
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
funds which should be which is on page
 
01:37:11.199 --> 01:37:12.750 align:start position:0%
funds which should be which is on page
11:21

01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
11:21
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
page 1123 is our state professional
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
2506 page 1124 is our project to wear
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
grant that we no longer
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes on page 1125 is accounting unit 2509
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
funds on page 1126 is accounting unit
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
funds then we'll move to page 1128
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 2511 is our title 4 B
 
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
funds representative thank you Mr chair
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
quick question on U page 1126 U account
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
2509 obviously I'm not unhappy about a
 
01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
large increase in federal grants but I
 
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could give me an
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
idea of how come we are so
 
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
lucky the Federal grant
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
lines have been increasing significant
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
and it would be nice to understand why
 
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
okay um these grants are 27mon grants so
 
01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
they allow for carry forward so we have
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
a large carry forward available to us so
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
we need to increase our appropriation to
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
be able to spend those funds that's when
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
I was getting used to the second year
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
carryover in the budget now there is the
 
01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:15.159 align:start position:0%
multi- budget carryover thank you you're
 
01:39:15.159 --> 01:39:23.990 align:start position:0%
multi- budget carryover thank you you're
welcome

01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
on page 1129 we have TW accounting unit
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
2512 that's our Title 1 C funds migrant
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
education can you speak to why that's
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
dropped so
 
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
much thank you for the questions so we
 
01:39:43.149 --> 01:39:43.159 align:start position:0%
have seen a significant decrease in the
 
01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
number of students that qualify for the
 
01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
migrant education program so that
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
identification has gone down
 
01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
um we tend to find here in New Hampshire
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
there aren a lot of uh because it's
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
agricultural there's very strict uh
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines for how you can qualify for
 
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
those funds and so those students tend
 
01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
um to be very little compared to like
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
Vermont they have a much larger
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
population than we do so we go out we do
 
01:40:11.709 --> 01:40:11.719 align:start position:0%
the work of identifying the students and
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
then we uh our funding is based on the
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
identified on page 11:30 we have 2513
 
01:40:29.310 --> 01:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
that some migrant education Consortium
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
Grant and that Grant was a competitive
 
01:40:35.589 --> 01:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
grant that went along with that other
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
Grant so that we could uh increase our
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
identification efforts and and do an
 
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
analysis and that's where we were able
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
that those
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
students the numbers have
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
decreased on page
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
1131 accounting unit at
 
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
grant I read Dy could you just explain
 
01:41:07.589 --> 01:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
what that Grant is all about I know it
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
says homeless but I mean thank you for
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
the question so the mckin vento grant is
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
specifically part of title one so
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
there's a a component that that they
 
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
carve out specifically targeting
 
01:41:21.149 --> 01:41:21.159 align:start position:0%
students that um identify as homeless
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
and so we can provide uh our Educators
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
in the state some training on how to
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
identify and support those students in
 
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
addition they do get an allocation so
 
01:41:31.709 --> 01:41:31.719 align:start position:0%
that schools identify those students
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
then there's an allocation that goes
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
students on page 1132 accounting unit
 
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
I don't Mr I don't want to uh make us go
 
01:41:59.149 --> 01:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
backwards too far but I think it'd be
 
01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
helpful for the committee can you go
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
back to page 1120 so the uh Ida special
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
ed 24 uh 2504 accounting unit that's
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
where there's a big uh bulk of uh the
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
federal fund or the federal positions
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner suggested could be
 
01:42:14.189 --> 01:42:14.199 align:start position:0%
abolished I don't know if you want to
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
speak to those while we're kind of going
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
through the accounting units and where
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
the abolished positions
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
so do you want to speak to that no there
 
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
were udl there were several
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah which account specifically of those
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
are you talking about 25 it's the top
 
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six seven eight
 
01:42:49.870 --> 01:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
document I just became aware of it just
 
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
now okay
 
01:42:56.830 --> 01:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
so several of those positions are
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
Universal Design learning implementation
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
specialist those were created we haven't
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
been able to fill them which I again he
 
01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
has said he is eliminating some
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
positions that we are having difficulty
 
01:43:13.589 --> 01:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
filling if we need them we can always go
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
back to fiscal to request them as
 
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
temporary full-time
 
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
positions but yeah I think there's like
 
01:43:27.589 --> 01:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
so it's because it's
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
I've on 11:21 it shows 30 out of 30
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
there's not a change there so those
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
numbers are not reflected how does how
 
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
do I find these Cuts here when it's I
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
don't see it on this page it says 30 out
 
01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
of you know it still says 30 people you
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
won't because this is the Govern we're
 
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the governor's recommended
 
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:50.760 align:start position:0%

D again I'm new so I'm trying to learn
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
what all of these things do the school
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
nutrition is that the three is that
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
three meals a day that you're supplying
 
01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
to all of the students is that what this
 
01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
is uh no this is for the free and
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
reduced um lunch and breakfast program
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
that we provide for students and it's on
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
a reimbursement basis and so students
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
that participate um they have available
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
to them the if they have a breakfast
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
program breakfast and schools that are
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%

operating the school nutrition program
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%

operate the school nutrition program
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%

about it but I do notice the zeros in 27

could you that was a fiveyear grant all
 
01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
right so basically the Federal grant

for the uh special education audit if we
 
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
need to proceed with that so we put in
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
some funding to be able to to do an RFP
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
work uh the is this um part of the the
 
01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
ask for each or for the Departments of
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs does this have to do
 
01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:21.189 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs does this have to do
with

01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
um the learning platform no thank you
 
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
for the question it is actually for a
 
01:53:30.669 --> 01:53:30.679 align:start position:0%
couple of projects but one is the um
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
special education is currently we have a
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
a very old system that has of all of our
 
01:53:37.629 --> 01:53:37.639 align:start position:0%
um student Information Systems so we are
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
rolling out a new one that's going to
 
01:53:41.709 --> 01:53:41.719 align:start position:0%
take place over the next couple of years
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
so we were able to
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
utilize some of our covid relief funds
 
01:53:49.149 --> 01:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
to get that project started then we
 
01:53:51.069 --> 01:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
braided in some federal funds and then
 
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
we're um U utilizing some State funds to
 
01:53:56.189 --> 01:53:56.199 align:start position:0%
be able to um do the whole project so
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
that there's a braiding of funds to
 
01:53:59.950 --> 01:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
support the work so that we have a new
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
special education information system
 
01:54:04.189 --> 01:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
that can Pro provide us with more robust
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
data more robust information and is more
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
user friendly and um kind of a timely as
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
well that's going to connect with our
 
01:54:15.069 --> 01:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
existing Alma system that Caitlyn
 
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
Davis's team has rolled out for the
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
years will this be providing more
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
specific data regarding individual EP
 
01:54:26.910 --> 01:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
costs and that and at the same time
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
you're working with the local districts
 
01:54:30.270 --> 01:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
to provide that information is that all
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
part of this yes it'll be the training
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
we definitely need a lot of training on
 
01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
how to utilize the new system okay and
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
is this also Rel to the
 
01:54:40.109 --> 01:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funding system that you have
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
you're having to bring in no that's a
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
that is not part of the
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um system I think that's
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
something that DHHS is working on
 
01:54:52.589 --> 01:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
separately okay so I have heard the
 
01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner speak in other um places
 
01:54:58.350 --> 01:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
regarding the the the melding of those
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
two because you have Medicaid issues in
 
01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
not issues the wrong word but um
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
potential for Medicaid funds in your
 
01:55:08.189 --> 01:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
world as well correct and eventually
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
you'll need to capture those through
 
01:55:13.229 --> 01:55:13.239 align:start position:0%
your systems possibly and the local will
 
01:55:14.189 --> 01:55:14.199 align:start position:0%
have to through the same thing through
 
01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
their systems I think it's something
 
01:55:19.229 --> 01:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
that would be phased in So currently the
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
project right now would not include that
 
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
but we could look further down the road
 
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
in adding that ability so what do you
 
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
expect in terms of the the types of data
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
the kind of data how much data you
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
expect from what you're doing right now
 
01:55:34.589 --> 01:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
so currently right now with the
 
01:55:35.950 --> 01:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
invoicing system and I think we've
 
01:55:37.149 --> 01:55:37.159 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about this with
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
special education Aid is that the the
 
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
invoices are all submitted almost kind
 
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
of in a shoe box but not really I mean
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's upload of information into a
 
01:55:47.069 --> 01:55:47.079 align:start position:0%
system and then we we're going in we're
 
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
looking at it we're then seeing those
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
services are they in the IEP are the
 
01:55:54.189 --> 01:55:54.199 align:start position:0%
hour correct and so we're doing a lot of
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
that work manually whereas this new
 
01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
system everything would be more in real
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
time and more um alignment so it
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't require that manual going
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
through and review because the
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
students's IEP would be in there and
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
then they could automatically you know
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
enter those costs and right now it's a
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
very analog type of system where we're
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
just uploading documents as opposed to
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
being able to go in and see that
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
information in in a system in a
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
dashboard type of uh format will part of
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
that require the local district one of
 
01:56:27.629 --> 01:56:27.639 align:start position:0%
the I as I understand one of the issues
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
is the local districts kind of make up
 
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
their own descriptions or accounts or
 
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
whatever in their reporting so there's
 
01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719 align:start position:0%
not a consistency across the state in
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
terms of how they report these things is
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
is it going to help to address that
 
01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
problem or I misunderstand that problem
 
01:56:42.109 --> 01:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
yes it will help to address that problem
 
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
okay so they're being brought on board
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
the local districts are being brought on
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
board of So currently they have to use
 
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
our our system so they'll have to
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
continue to use this new system that we
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
roll out right they're being brought on
 
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
board with a new approach if you will
 
01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you great and when's
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
that when do you expect to start just
 
01:57:02.910 --> 01:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
have the results of that I appreciate
 
01:57:06.069 --> 01:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
the question so our our aim is actually
 
01:57:08.669 --> 01:57:08.679 align:start position:0%
to be able to in about a year to be able
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
to have those schools that already have
 
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
the system um that they're utilizing our
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
our Alma districts is what we like to
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
call them that they're already using
 
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
that as a student information system so
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
in about a year next January we're
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
looking at being able to kind of roll
 
01:57:25.149 --> 01:57:25.159 align:start position:0%
out with those and then uh a full
 
01:57:27.069 --> 01:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
implementation hopefully
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide in Fall of
 
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
2026 and does part of that involve their
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
District's reporting not waiting till
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
like June 30 or whatever it is when you
 
01:57:37.709 --> 01:57:37.719 align:start position:0%
get everything sort of throughout the
 
01:57:39.550 --> 01:57:39.560 align:start position:0%
year or is it still going to be all at
 
01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
the end I think the hope is going to be
 
01:57:44.109 --> 01:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
or we're aiming for having more
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
consistent uploading of that
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
documentation but again be because of
 
01:57:50.589 --> 01:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
the way the legislation is written it
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
does require us to kind of go through
 
01:57:55.229 --> 01:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
and zero out other things before they
 
01:57:58.270 --> 01:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
can apply for that special education Aid
 
01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
so we often times they don't know their
 
01:58:02.109 --> 01:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
numbers until the end but we're going to
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
work on trying to have more timely
 
01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
uploading of the of the potential costs
 
01:58:08.189 --> 01:58:08.199 align:start position:0%
so that they're able to see more in real
 
01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
time what what that looks like for those
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
students does that mean it sound like
 
01:58:14.109 --> 01:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
you refer to legislation it didn't sound
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
like you did refer to legislation is
 
01:58:17.069 --> 01:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
there changes that can be made that
 
01:58:19.390 --> 01:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
would help your process well I think
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
right now the time frame that's actually
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
in statute we may have to just look at
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
that once we are a little bit further
 
01:58:28.109 --> 01:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
along in our process maybe for for next
 
01:58:31.229 --> 01:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
year thank you any more questions around
 
01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
you so on page
 
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
1157 we have accounting unit
 
01:58:57.149 --> 01:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
and on page 393 not page no same page
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 3936 we have granted
 
01:59:03.719 --> 01:59:06.430 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 3936 we have granted
Advance

01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:08.589 --> 01:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
corporation that is a Federal Grant I
 
01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
also and then we move that's the end of
 
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
you we move
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
to Workforce Innovation you have any
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
questions I have Rich Salah here for VR
 
01:59:40.270 --> 01:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
anyways so the first thing you'll see is
 
01:59:43.069 --> 01:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
on page 1160 you'll see the accounting
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
unit 2537 be our admin
 
01:59:50.350 --> 01:59:50.360 align:start position:0%
program and it's all zero that's because
 
01:59:52.350 --> 01:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
everything we've moved everything this
 
01:59:54.750 --> 01:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
is another federal reporting thing so
 
01:59:57.030 --> 01:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
we've moved instead of having two VR
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
accounts and trying to figure out the
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
federal reporting we've changed the way
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
that we're um um documenting things
 
02:00:07.069 --> 02:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
internally in the office so that we can
 
02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
do the federal reports more efficiently
 
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
so we've moved all of the funds into one
 
02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:12.470 align:start position:0%
so we've moved all of the funds into one
V

02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
V
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
account which what is that account 253
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
2538 is that on the next page might be a
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's on page 1161 so you'll see that
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
there is an increase in the funding and
 
02:00:31.069 --> 02:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
that is why you see the increase in the
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
funding is because we took two accounts
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
unit so then we have accounting unit
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.709 --> 02:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
account on page 1163 we have accounting
 
02:01:01.719 --> 02:01:02.790 align:start position:0%
account on page 1163 we have accounting
unit

02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
unit
 
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
B the same page we have our accounting
 
02:01:25.069 --> 02:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:26.189 --> 02:01:26.199 align:start position:0%
on page
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
1164 accounting unit 2544 is independent
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
State on page 1165 we have our John
 
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:56.910 --> 02:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm just curious about the
 
02:01:59.470 --> 02:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
John nesp because it's it's a new fund
 
02:02:02.589 --> 02:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
apparently and was there an additional
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh money added to it for um the trust
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
fund I assume someone set up a trust
 
02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
fund in his name for a particular
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
purpose and it looks like the fund is
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
growing or how much you know what I'm
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
saying I do okay thank you it it it
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
really is not a new fund there were no
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
funds spent in it last year in 24
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
um so this is again an interest bearing
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
fund so the fund is actually growing
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's why we've had additional
 
02:02:36.750 --> 02:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.109 --> 02:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
welcome on page 1166 we have our vending
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
2548 followed by accounting unit 2549
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
and that is all of the VR programs the
 
02:03:08.109 --> 02:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
next one is our accounting unit 2550 on
 
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
page 1168 which is our disability
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
account yes and there were several
 
02:03:18.629 --> 02:03:18.639 align:start position:0%
positions as the commissioner discussed
 
02:03:20.669 --> 02:03:20.679 align:start position:0%
that we were looking to get rid of so
 
02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
that count of 7 I don't know if it would
 
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
go down by like 10 maybe I don't
 
02:03:30.350 --> 02:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
more independent Services Part B state
 
02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
1169 and then our last accounting unit
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
childhood and that oh NOP I'm sorry I
 
02:04:04.750 --> 02:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
misspoke on page 1170 we have our cart
 
02:04:07.390 --> 02:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
provider accounting unit
 
02:04:11.069 --> 02:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
5715 that is a new accounting unit
 
02:04:11.079 --> 02:04:12.229 align:start position:0%
5715 that is a new accounting unit
revolving

02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
revolving
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
funds I think we developed that
 
02:04:16.750 --> 02:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
accounting unit in anticipation of
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
receiving funds through a fee the cart
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
oh this
 
02:04:28.549 --> 02:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
so yeah uh this was because um we
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
recognized that we had a um we have an
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
RSA that allows us to um provide tuition
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
to cart uh providers and interpreters um
 
02:04:43.069 --> 02:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
if if um those funds were available we
 
02:04:44.709 --> 02:04:44.719 align:start position:0%
could we could use it but we didn't have
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
any place to put it we just recognized
 
02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
that we did but we haven't used it in
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:54.510 --> 02:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
it does and I was afraid you were going
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
that I'll have to get back to you I
 
02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:06.350 align:start position:0%
that I'll have to get back to you I
can't

02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
remember and so that ends that Division
 
02:05:11.069 --> 02:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
and then we move on to the education
 
02:05:16.549 --> 02:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:22.750 --> 02:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
so on page 1171 we have the education
 
02:05:27.310 --> 02:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
trust fund Administration accounting
 
02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:37.910 align:start position:0%
trust fund Administration accounting
unit

02:05:37.910 --> 02:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
2196

02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
and just on this particular um item I'm
 
02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
um line 010 looks look like we're having
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
some additions here so these are the
 
02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
positions that we kind of talked about
 
02:05:58.549 --> 02:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
before that had been been spread out
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
throughout the different accounting
 
02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
units they all work on our state systems
 
02:06:04.709 --> 02:06:04.719 align:start position:0%
our data systems and so we've moved them
 
02:06:06.510 --> 02:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
here so we can really see what the cost
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
of operating our state systems are and
 
02:06:10.589 --> 02:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
then they're being built back as fed as
 
02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate so um some of these
 
02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
positions one of them I can think of
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
collects um College and Career Readiness
 
02:06:21.149 --> 02:06:21.159 align:start position:0%
indicators and so that's about 25% of
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
their time and that's something that's
 
02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
required of the federal assessment Grant
 
02:06:25.709 --> 02:06:25.719 align:start position:0%
so 25% of their time will be buil back
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
to the federal assessment Grant um some
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
of these are just um it's it's really
 
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
more just of a kind of a TR up of of
 
02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
where the positions actually the work
 
02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
that they're doing and the support that
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
they're doing versus you know where they
 
02:06:40.229 --> 02:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
were living because if a position was
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
before like living under a federal
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
assessment Grant the federal assessment
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
Grant was being built for additional
 
02:06:46.030 --> 02:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
costs associated that with that position
 
02:06:48.510 --> 02:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
which is really not allowable um and so
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
that's really what we did here with this
 
02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:53.229 align:start position:0%
that's really what we did here with this
budget

02:06:53.229 --> 02:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:06:55.229 --> 02:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
repr papich thank you I just wanted to
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
jump into that question that wasn't
 
02:06:59.950 --> 02:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
answered earlier a bit of U quick
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
searching seems to Define cart as
 
02:07:06.030 --> 02:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
Communications access realtime
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
translation so and since ASL is American
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
Sign Language we have a general
 
02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of what that budget item
 
02:07:18.510 --> 02:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
is for sure communication access real
 
02:07:21.629 --> 02:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
time translation card
 
02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
it's one of the many frankly weird
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
acronyms that the the government
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes use to make sure regular
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
people have no idea what they are
 
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
reading about so honors to God but you
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
know this is from the new HDH New
 
02:07:43.069 --> 02:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
way all right so moving on to page
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
1173 we have the education trust fund
 
02:07:54.430 --> 02:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
as you can see this is accounting unit
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
3043 we have a lot of zeros in this
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
banial budget and those are the accounts
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%
that were moved those are the funds
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
lines that were moved to their own
 
02:08:07.229 --> 02:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
individual accounting
 
02:08:07.239 --> 02:08:08.870 align:start position:0%
individual accounting
unit

02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
unit
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see the first one 3445 on
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
that same page Charter Schools starts
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
out as zeros for 2425 and then it has
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
$66 million for 262
 
02:08:23.199 --> 02:08:24.870 align:start position:0%
$66 million for 262
seven

02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:08:28.750 --> 02:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
and and you'd have to like look at
 
02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:29.629 align:start position:0%
and and you'd have to like look at
Charter

02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
Charter
 
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:32.079 align:start position:0%
Schools and then go back up to
 
02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
3043 and find the charter schools which
 
02:08:40.549 --> 02:08:40.559 align:start position:0%
is in that accounting unit class 611 to
 
02:08:43.470 --> 02:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
see that it was 60 million 61 million
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
and then come back down to this
 
02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:47.639 align:start position:0%
accounting unit to be able to see how
 
02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
the money flows I should add relist to
 
02:08:51.629 --> 02:08:51.639 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools we have additional
 
02:08:54.669 --> 02:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
information that we can provide um after
 
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
this or after lunch I know you have the
 
02:08:57.310 --> 02:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
whole day budgeted to the Department of
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
Education so we have more adequacy
 
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
charter schools and EA handouts I just
 
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
we don't need to keep everybody else
 
02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
later so on page
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
1174 we have the education Freedom
 
02:09:19.350 --> 02:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
accounts again that does tie back to the
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:27.629 --> 02:09:27.639 align:start position:0%
on page
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
1175 we have 3447 which is the EFA phase
 
02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:38.750 align:start position:0%
1175 we have 3447 which is the EFA phase
out

02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:42.270 --> 02:09:42.280 align:start position:0%
grants the next accounting unit is 3478
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:52.109 --> 02:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
Testing I know it can be a little
 
02:09:52.119 --> 02:09:59.350 align:start position:0%
Testing I know it can be a little
challenging

02:09:59.350 --> 02:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
with on
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
page 1176 we have our school building
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
Aid and this is just the tail so there
 
02:10:15.030 --> 02:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
that accounting unit 3998 is building
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
on page
 
02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:42.589 --> 02:10:42.599 align:start position:0%
Aid on page 1178 we have accounting unit
 
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
40 oh I'm sorry yeah yeah on that one
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
both that one and the previous account
 
02:10:51.870 --> 02:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
the funding is Grants non
 
02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:53.549 align:start position:0%
the funding is Grants non
Federal

02:10:53.549 --> 02:10:53.559 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
02:10:56.149 --> 02:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
correct correct so what does that refer
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
to what in those two instances that's
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
how that was the change that admin
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
Services wanted us to do they wanted us
 
02:11:06.750 --> 02:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
to um follow their chart of accounts
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
which prior so if you look at the
 
02:11:12.189 --> 02:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
special special education Aid in
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:14.950 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
304

02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
304
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
43 it was a class 629 which was created
 
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
specifically for that counting unit and
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
they wanted us to move away from
 
02:11:27.709 --> 02:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
creating special classes and instead use
 
02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
the existing classes so in this example
 
02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
These funds that are going to the
 
02:11:34.510 --> 02:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
schools are grants but they're not
 
02:11:36.510 --> 02:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
federal grants they're State F state
 
02:11:39.229 --> 02:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
grants state grants okay that's um so
 
02:11:42.910 --> 02:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see that so that would be just to
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
put it in my in terms I understand that
 
02:11:46.229 --> 02:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
would be part of the adequacy formula
 
02:11:47.830 --> 02:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
that we that's the catastrophic Aid
 
02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:04.030 --> 02:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:08.189 --> 02:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
so we did building Aid did we and 3998
 
02:12:11.149 --> 02:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
on page 1176 was building eight lease I
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
might re be repeating my oh I
 
02:12:19.549 --> 02:12:19.559 align:start position:0%
am on Page 1178 is accounting unit 4074
 
02:12:21.310 --> 02:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
that's tuition and transportation those
 
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
Grant and
 
02:12:32.790 --> 02:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
then accounting unit 4076 is a cell
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
phone free education
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
grant cell phone free not a free
 
02:12:39.119 --> 02:12:40.549 align:start position:0%
grant cell phone free not a free
education

02:12:40.549 --> 02:12:40.559 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
grant um and
 
02:12:49.149 --> 02:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.910 --> 02:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
so we're hearing on the news that the
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
new secretary of
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
education federally is is saying we're
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
going to send you all just a block grant
 
02:13:09.870 --> 02:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
have you started to plan for how that's
 
02:13:12.510 --> 02:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
going to work out and I I think we
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
really need to see the language that
 
02:13:15.910 --> 02:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
they use to do that first but we do have
 
02:13:18.030 --> 02:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
Grant methodologies that could work here
 
02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire already so Title One
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
For example is for for educationally
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged students we have in our
 
02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula a formula we use for
 
02:13:28.589 --> 02:13:28.599 align:start position:0%
educationally disadvantaged students
 
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
where we heavily wait free and reduce
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
lunch and equalize valuations um that's
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant so there's
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
no reason why something like the
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
existing extraordinary needs grants
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't be used um for uh determining
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
that but we really want to see the
 
02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
language before um before we we spent a
 
02:13:48.030 --> 02:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
lot of time and effort going down One
 
02:13:49.310 --> 02:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
path and then they've said something
 
02:13:51.310 --> 02:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
entirely different so any changes going
 
02:13:53.310 --> 02:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
to make in the legislature probably be
 
02:13:56.430 --> 02:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
in the second year we we wouldn't know
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
in time to get it done well we likely
 
02:14:01.549 --> 02:14:01.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need legislation to do it um
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
because um because we have the funds
 
02:14:06.270 --> 02:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
budgeted already in just a generic Grant
 
02:14:07.870 --> 02:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
Line it's just the way that it's it's
 
02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
distributed so and you expect to get
 
02:14:14.069 --> 02:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
roughly the same amount or maybe more
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
we're certainly hopeful we'll get the
 
02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
same amount but there has been little
 
02:14:35.069 --> 02:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:35.079 --> 02:14:37.229 align:start position:0%
 
other

02:14:37.229 --> 02:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:14:37.239 --> 02:14:38.990 align:start position:0%
other
questions

02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:14:42.910 --> 02:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
PR go ahead p and Phillips uh I'm just
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the hospital 2 um spreadsheet
 
02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner walked through
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
briefly this morning and um I'm looking
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
at item number three the adequacy final
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
calculation if I'm understanding
 
02:14:58.669 --> 02:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
correctly um
 
02:15:02.350 --> 02:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:06.669 --> 02:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.390 --> 02:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
know they out update the Department of
 
02:15:11.350 --> 02:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
Education twice a year for this purpose
 
02:15:13.990 --> 02:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
but the department is asking for only
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
one calculation is that right no that's
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
that is not correct um so schools have
 
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
two major dead lines but then schools
 
02:15:24.430 --> 02:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes change your data after those
 
02:15:26.229 --> 02:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
deadlines and so what we're really
 
02:15:29.669 --> 02:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
asking for is that we run adequacy on
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
October 1st of every year and we give it
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
to Department of Revenue and Department
 
02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
of Revenue uses that to to set tax rates
 
02:15:37.390 --> 02:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
and then we use that against our tax
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
warrant to say like how much they have
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
to raise after after the amount they're
 
02:15:43.950 --> 02:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
getting um then for some reason and I
 
02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
think this has existed before the
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Education had the quality
 
02:15:49.629 --> 02:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
Data Systems that we do now the law
 
02:15:51.790 --> 02:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
requires us to go in and recalculate
 
02:15:54.830 --> 02:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
again in April of the year so right now
 
02:15:56.549 --> 02:15:56.559 align:start position:0%
in March we are recalculating it again
 
02:15:59.229 --> 02:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
for April 1st um most of the schools
 
02:16:01.390 --> 02:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
haven't their data hasn't changed at all
 
02:16:03.549 --> 02:16:03.559 align:start position:0%
um but some schools have had one or two
 
02:16:05.470 --> 02:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
kids change here and there they would be
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
identified the previous year the
 
02:16:09.149 --> 02:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
department doesn't really feel that
 
02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
there is any um value in that exercise
 
02:16:14.669 --> 02:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
of rerunning it a second time um so we
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
just asked to take that out of the
 
02:16:18.990 --> 02:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
requirements now we did want to build
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
something in if a school did for some
 
02:16:23.790 --> 02:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
reason forget a whole bunch of kids the
 
02:16:26.069 --> 02:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
previous year somehow they determined
 
02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
all of their they forgot all of their
 
02:16:28.589 --> 02:16:28.599 align:start position:0%
freedom juice lunch kids we wanted to
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
say well we do want to have a mechanism
 
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
for that but because it's so far and few
 
02:16:34.110 --> 02:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
between we don't want to have to do it
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
for all schools especially because it's
 
02:16:37.549 --> 02:16:37.559 align:start position:0%
after the tax rates are being said so we
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
value Dy please don't take this as
 
02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
anything other than something to help
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
you as a new person when I'm going
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
through all of this obviously I don't
 
02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
know all the acronyms that you're using
 
02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
obviously I don't understand all the
 
02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
grant processes and what have you the
 
02:17:01.230 --> 02:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
accounting is accounting however it
 
02:17:04.830 --> 02:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
would really behoove me or maybe others
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
if in your if you had a separate sheet
 
02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
and you put down everything that you
 
02:17:12.429 --> 02:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
explain because you're here look how
 
02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
many of you are here not that we don't
 
02:17:16.750 --> 02:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
want you here I don't imagine but we're
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
wasting your time asking questions that
 
02:17:21.549 --> 02:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
a little footnote for each one why it
 
02:17:23.629 --> 02:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
changed and it went to here you know
 
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
this one's being eliminated this one's
 
02:17:27.750 --> 02:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
being added whatever it might be might
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
help all of us and prepping us for now
 
02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
this is just me maybe the rest of you
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
don't feel that way um to ask you more
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
pertinent questions that you wouldn't
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't necessarily think about
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
because we're so focused on okay where
 
02:17:43.709 --> 02:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
did this go what's that you know what
 
02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'm saying we can look at that for
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
future presentations and it might save
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:59.190 --> 02:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
so where are we going from
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
here do you want to talk about charter
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
schools in adequacy
 
02:18:07.870 --> 02:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
today so as you all know there's there's
 
02:18:10.429 --> 02:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
you know $1.23 billion dollar of
 
02:18:12.750 --> 02:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
Education trust fund Appropriations that
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
the department is prepared to take a
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
deeper dive into they have additional
 
02:18:18.509 --> 02:18:18.519 align:start position:0%
handouts so so District adequacy efas
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools plus we can talk about
 
02:18:23.070 --> 02:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
the other specific uh levels of funding
 
02:18:25.389 --> 02:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
that the governor proposed um you have
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
45 minutes now before lunch you could
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
start maybe take a break and then come
 
02:18:29.790 --> 02:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
back and finish probably won't get
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
everywhere you want to get to this
 
02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:32.519 align:start position:0%
morning but we might as well use the
 
02:18:34.589 --> 02:18:34.599 align:start position:0%
time maybe I don't know if people need a
 
02:18:36.349 --> 02:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
break before getting into that or just
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
want to keep going can you last for 45
 
02:18:40.589 --> 02:18:40.599 align:start position:0%
minutes and then just take a a five
 
02:18:42.389 --> 02:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
minute break you a five minute break
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
right now okay go
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
ahead you all can take a break too if
 
02:18:52.669 --> 02:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.709 --> 02:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.719 --> 02:19:49.630 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.640 --> 02:20:19.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:49.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:20:49.630 --> 02:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:49.640 --> 02:21:19.550 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:49.520 --> 02:22:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:22:19.510 --> 02:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:49.429 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:49.439 --> 02:23:19.429 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:19.439 --> 02:23:49.429 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
Hey listen I didn't go to bed until 2:30
 
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
so the first thing I'd like to do if I
 
02:25:06.830 --> 02:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
could get the committee
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
wer G if you want thank you that's why
 
02:25:16.399 --> 02:25:19.309 align:start position:0%
wer G if you want thank you that's why
you

02:25:19.309 --> 02:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:22.429 --> 02:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
ped TR to throw it down just in case I
 
02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
guess so the first thing I want to do is
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
talk to the committee separate from the
 
02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
group uh the people presenting they've
 
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
asked there's two particular people that
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
are here that could cover a couple
 
02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
things and then be done if possible if
 
02:25:37.309 --> 02:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
we have questions the two areas are the
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
spe special education catastrophic Aid
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:25:44.110 --> 02:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
building Aid building is that what it
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
was building Aid yes yeah so the
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
question is to the committee
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative wer this includes you um
 
02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
do do folks here have questions they
 
02:25:56.349 --> 02:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
would like to ask about first of all
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
let's take catastrophic
 
02:26:01.070 --> 02:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
Aid special education catastrophic
 
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
Aid and and specifically so there's
 
02:26:05.070 --> 02:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
amounts that are in the budget the
 
02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
governor changed those amounts we've had
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
robust conversations about these grants
 
02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
at this point in front of this committee
 
02:26:12.269 --> 02:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
and the house funding policy commit or
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
house funding committee um and our
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
question really to you is what else do
 
02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
you need from the Department to be able
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
to make a decision relative to the
 
02:26:22.590 --> 02:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
budget and where you want to go
 
02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
for both building Aid and catastrophic
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:32.990 --> 02:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
Aid mate go
 
02:26:36.429 --> 02:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
ahead I guess it would help me um as you
 
02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
know I'd like the narrative and perhaps
 
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
you can take us back and just go through
 
02:26:42.910 --> 02:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
you sort of not NE I don't want a
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
history but um just a narrative of how
 
02:26:49.389 --> 02:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
this has spun out and what you see in
 
02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
the future of what you know we're here
 
02:26:53.309 --> 02:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
to try to help you what your needs are
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
going to be um how you would see
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid develop or
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
undevelop thank you for the question and
 
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going a little bit off the cuff here
 
02:27:04.269 --> 02:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
my computer died the battery the
 
02:27:06.990 --> 02:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
battery's done so when we were looking
 
02:27:10.910 --> 02:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
at um doing the
 
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations a few years back for this
 
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
bium at that time the
 
02:27:20.830 --> 02:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
33.5 is Million Dollar was in alignment
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
with what we were anticipating so now
 
02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
that the cost this year being 50 million
 
02:27:29.150 --> 02:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
we it wasn't really something we would
 
02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
have anticipated years ago and so that's
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
why we we have that a shortfall with the
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation and we're seeking the the
 
02:27:38.269 --> 02:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
16 million to to kind of make up or that
 
02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
is in the governor's uh budget to kind
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
of make up that 16 million and then
 
02:27:44.670 --> 02:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
going forward we're looking at funding
 
02:27:48.830 --> 02:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
it at 50 million but I I think that it
 
02:27:50.990 --> 02:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:27:52.910 --> 02:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
few years before that I think we were at
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
22 million I at the top of my head I
 
02:28:02.429 --> 02:28:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:05.389 --> 02:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
maybe it's on
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
page page
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
1177 it's a county unit
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
4073 that will show you what the
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed but you have to
 
02:28:15.790 --> 02:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
remember this is one of those accounts
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
that shifted if you want to see the
 
02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
3 are you in the middle of finishing
 
02:28:40.030 --> 02:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
your thoughts or yes okay representer
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
chairman wer this CAD a it shouldn't
 
02:28:46.110 --> 02:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
come as a surprise at the end of the
 
02:28:48.349 --> 02:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
year that we're 50 million behind or
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
whatever the figure was we should be
 
02:28:53.230 --> 02:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
getting periodic updates otherwise we're
 
02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
not going to approve them I mean you
 
02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
can't just decide at the end of the year
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
oh gee we went thousands of dollars over
 
02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
what we thought they knew that all along
 
02:29:03.030 --> 02:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
they just didn't bother to let anybody
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
know well I think it's a little bit
 
02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's a little
 
02:29:09.790 --> 02:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
bit um challenging because the way that
 
02:29:11.950 --> 02:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
it's written it and you're doing the
 
02:29:15.269 --> 02:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
formula after the fact and so they have
 
02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
to you know look at spending down one of
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
the things that we looked at too was
 
02:29:21.990 --> 02:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
ensuring that you utilized all of your
 
02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
federal funds here making sure you
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
utilized all of your um the available uh
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
Sesser funds that came specifically for
 
02:29:32.190 --> 02:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
special education AIDS so we did have
 
02:29:33.630 --> 02:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
them go through to make sure like you
 
02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
utilized all of these then we're looking
 
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
at calculating the formula based on
 
02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:41.349 align:start position:0%
at calculating the formula based on
those

02:29:41.349 --> 02:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:29:45.790 --> 02:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
costs in in AAR and so it takes time for
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
us to go through and to be able to
 
02:29:50.830 --> 02:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
review all of that it I I think we've
 
02:29:52.830 --> 02:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about what are some
 
02:29:54.750 --> 02:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
ways we could
 
02:29:58.230 --> 02:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
possibly structure this so that we have
 
02:30:01.389 --> 02:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
the ability to do it more up to date but
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
I think that we're a bit limited by how
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's written because we have to follow
 
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
the timeline specifically so but the
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
questions I was asking you earlier
 
02:30:12.469 --> 02:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
regarding what you're doing over the
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
next few years is it's hoping to address
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
some of what representative wer was
 
02:30:20.269 --> 02:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
Raising yes we want to be able to um imp
 
02:30:22.190 --> 02:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
A system that to do more of this in real
 
02:30:24.750 --> 02:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
time because again we you know we were
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
functioning kind of here's your box of
 
02:30:28.630 --> 02:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
receipts at years ago youed to take to
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
your account okay figure out everything
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
that happened for me last year we're
 
02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
getting away from that so that it can be
 
02:30:35.950 --> 02:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
done in more real time and also so that
 
02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
it can help the districts kind of look
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
at in real time what's what's going on
 
02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
and how they're they're looking at those
 
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
expenses does that help
 
02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
um repres papait thank you Mr chair
 
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
so when uh chairman asked earlier what
 
02:30:57.670 --> 02:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
would you like I have a list but I know
 
02:30:59.870 --> 02:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
that you also are not in a position to
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
deliver on that because what I really
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
want is to understand that the
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Education at some point in
 
02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
the future will have the ability to
 
02:31:10.030 --> 02:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
really drill down into the special
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
education cost at the student level if
 
02:31:15.469 --> 02:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
needed and just understand both what's
 
02:31:18.110 --> 02:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
going on which I understand today with a
 
02:31:19.790 --> 02:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
current reporting you guys cannot do
 
02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
that that I get it and also taking it
 
02:31:25.630 --> 02:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
one step further down that road once we
 
02:31:28.269 --> 02:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
start understanding how much we are
 
02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
spending for every service for every
 
02:31:31.630 --> 02:31:31.640 align:start position:0%
child there is a database that again the
 
02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
department can look at and analyze right
 
02:31:37.790 --> 02:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
then hopefully we'll be able to to see
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
if there is any way to standardize or
 
02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
find appropriate cost for some of those
 
02:31:45.870 --> 02:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
and services and uh you know determine
 
02:31:47.710 --> 02:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
whether there are more cost effective
 
02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
ways for the various school districts to
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
find the same Services you know to offer
 
02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
the same services but maybe have a you
 
02:31:57.150 --> 02:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
know broader contract from the state
 
02:31:59.710 --> 02:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
that uh gets better prices and so on
 
02:32:01.269 --> 02:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
obviously this is far down the road but
 
02:32:03.870 --> 02:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the long term in the
 
02:32:06.030 --> 02:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
meantime we'll Soldier on with what we
 
02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
have so uh I I really appreciate how
 
02:32:10.550 --> 02:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
hard you guys are working I understand
 
02:32:13.990 --> 02:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
right now you cannot get that data and
 
02:32:16.349 --> 02:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
that frustration that chairman wer was
 
02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
expressing about only knowing post facto
 
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
that we have a cost overrun and not just
 
02:32:24.429 --> 02:32:24.439 align:start position:0%
post facto but like half a year after
 
02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
the school year ended obviously that's a
 
02:32:28.750 --> 02:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
process that needs fixing but you guys
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
are in the process of fixing it so uh
 
02:32:33.389 --> 02:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
we'll patiently wait and support you on
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
you maybe this will help as well um so
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
yall should be aware that the education
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
funding committee has a bill coming to
 
02:32:47.830 --> 02:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
the floor this week specifically related
 
02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
to this uh catastrophic Aid situation um
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
and specifically related to the pration
 
02:32:59.110 --> 02:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
um component of it so the governor has
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
as they indicated added more money into
 
02:33:04.190 --> 02:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
the budget to essentially cover what if
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
if the if it doesn't increase yet
 
02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
further um and that bill currently
 
02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
before the current will be coming before
 
02:33:12.510 --> 02:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
the house um sets a specific floor on
 
02:33:16.590 --> 02:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
the pration value if you will so go
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
ahead represent
 
02:33:20.070 --> 02:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
Murray yeah I was just wanted to follow
 
02:33:22.830 --> 02:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
up with um you know the I guess the the
 
02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
problems of pration um how it impacts
 
02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
the school districts and um it seems in
 
02:33:30.870 --> 02:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
the past few
 
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
years the amount that's been priated
 
02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
back to the school has increased it's
 
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
gotten was like at 20% for a while was
 
02:33:40.150 --> 02:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
there point where it reached 30% or can
 
02:33:42.070 --> 02:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
you you know can you give some history
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
as to um because it's not fully funded
 
02:33:48.349 --> 02:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
how it goes back to the
 
02:33:51.630 --> 02:33:51.640 align:start position:0%
schools are you talking about for the if
 
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
that 16 million would were to be
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
appropriated or are we talking about the
 
02:33:59.670 --> 02:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
past in the past hopefully going forward
 
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
that would not be an issue so we um did
 
02:34:07.950 --> 02:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
provide a document to you that looked at
 
02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
from 2007 to about
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
2025 that had the that pration amount so
 
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
it it has fluctuated throughout the year
 
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
so it's like you know we're at 100% And
 
02:34:21.230 --> 02:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
then about in 2012 we got to a point
 
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
where we were at that
 
02:34:26.910 --> 02:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
69% and then we were able to go in uh
 
02:34:29.990 --> 02:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
and add in funds slowly but we were
 
02:34:33.469 --> 02:34:33.479 align:start position:0%
still at that 70% range until we got to
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh 2020 where it did go up to
 
02:34:40.590 --> 02:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
30.8 and then that's when we were at
 
02:34:44.790 --> 02:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
that 94 to 100% so I think the
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
challenges there's an amount that's
 
02:34:49.309 --> 02:34:49.319 align:start position:0%
appropriated that's all we can spend
 
02:34:52.230 --> 02:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to prate
 
02:34:55.389 --> 02:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
it if the legislation was worded where
 
02:34:58.429 --> 02:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
we were able to draw down funds then we
 
02:35:00.309 --> 02:35:00.319 align:start position:0%
don't have to do the pration part or the
 
02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
pration is taken out I think I've seen
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
some legislation that uh proposed taking
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
out that pration and then the ability to
 
02:35:10.750 --> 02:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
draw down those funds but I'm not sure
 
02:35:13.269 --> 02:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
so I mean right now we have to go with
 
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
the way that it's written um which this
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
year put us at that 69% last year was 7%
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
the year before that 98% 100% so we were
 
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
meeting um Our obligation for the most
 
02:35:31.590 --> 02:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
part until this
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
year so so the bill the bill I'm
 
02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
referring to if I'm not mistaken you
 
02:35:37.790 --> 02:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong here it sets a
 
02:35:41.230 --> 02:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
floor on the probation of 80% is that
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that was a wooden drop below
 
02:35:46.269 --> 02:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
80% with with this bill and they'd have
 
02:35:48.510 --> 02:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
a warrant to draw in order to satisfy
 
02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:50.830 align:start position:0%
a warrant to draw in order to satisfy
that

02:35:50.830 --> 02:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:53.309 --> 02:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
and just to um talk about planning right
 
02:35:55.630 --> 02:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
because one of the stresses that this
 
02:35:58.030 --> 02:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
creates to school districts is that
 
02:36:00.469 --> 02:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
they're attempting to budget and they
 
02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what level to Budget on this
 
02:36:04.710 --> 02:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
you know particular aid for and they
 
02:36:07.550 --> 02:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
hope to get 100% and actually the
 
02:36:09.790 --> 02:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
department has done pretty well lately
 
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
in getting that 100% or close to it
 
02:36:16.830 --> 02:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
until the last budget cycle when uh you
 
02:36:19.269 --> 02:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
know everything seems to have exploded
 
02:36:21.630 --> 02:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
into terms of cost and everybody again
 
02:36:23.230 --> 02:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
we were told earlier this morning that
 
02:36:25.469 --> 02:36:25.479 align:start position:0%
the school budgets are like 60 million
 
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
over on that line so there has been a
 
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
unexpected spike in special education
 
02:36:33.150 --> 02:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
caost that you know we couldn't address
 
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
but the reason why the bill coming to
 
02:36:39.550 --> 02:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
the floor has a a floor on it is that
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
while the idea is to give every school
 
02:36:46.830 --> 02:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
district 100% of what they aim for at
 
02:36:49.830 --> 02:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
least this way they can budget for 80%
 
02:36:52.990 --> 02:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
and know that it won't get below that
 
02:36:56.110 --> 02:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
so you know trying to guarantee 100%
 
02:36:58.110 --> 02:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
probably is not fiscally possible so we
 
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
try to do the best we can to give the
 
02:37:01.950 --> 02:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
schools the predictability while at the
 
02:37:05.269 --> 02:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
same time not heading straight into uh
 
02:37:10.510 --> 02:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
so when Mark gets up here too he can
 
02:37:14.910 --> 02:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
talk you through really how it works
 
02:37:16.830 --> 02:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
when a District budget is prepared and
 
02:37:18.590 --> 02:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
then when the tax rates are sent too so
 
02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
we could do that as part part of Mark's
 
02:37:21.630 --> 02:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
presentation kind of Step by Step
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
because that's probably an important
 
02:37:25.150 --> 02:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
piece for the committee to understand
 
02:37:27.469 --> 02:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
and this is part of that but adequacy is
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
part of that as his building Aid
 
02:37:33.150 --> 02:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
so goe I was just saying you know having
 
02:37:35.230 --> 02:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
the 80% floor I can see the value in
 
02:37:36.389 --> 02:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
that but if you're looking at
 
02:37:38.349 --> 02:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
percentages that still doesn't help the
 
02:37:40.110 --> 02:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
school district know exactly how much
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to pay um not
 
02:37:45.230 --> 02:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
knowing what they'll have to expend on
 
02:37:46.830 --> 02:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
for any particular student for special
 
02:37:50.190 --> 02:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
ed so I see it gives a a binder it gives
 
02:37:53.550 --> 02:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
a range but um you know it's 80% of an
 
02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:54.910 align:start position:0%
a range but um you know it's 80% of an
unknown

02:37:54.910 --> 02:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
unknown
 
02:37:57.510 --> 02:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
number and that's part of why this fund
 
02:37:59.710 --> 02:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
was originally developed was the state
 
02:38:01.309 --> 02:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid fund was because school
 
02:38:02.950 --> 02:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
district would have a high cost special
 
02:38:05.070 --> 02:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
education kid move in and they wouldn't
 
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily have budgeted for that kid
 
02:38:09.070 --> 02:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
um or in some of these small school
 
02:38:11.710 --> 02:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
districts some of these kids cost could
 
02:38:13.870 --> 02:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
be a large percentage of their budget
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's why we had State special
 
02:38:18.110 --> 02:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
education funding outside of the
 
02:38:20.030 --> 02:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula which provides a base
 
02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
amount for all special education kids we
 
02:38:23.429 --> 02:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
were saying No this amount right here is
 
02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
a uh we want to help school districts in
 
02:38:28.190 --> 02:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
response to these high special education
 
02:38:31.630 --> 02:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
costs um associated with with certain
 
02:38:34.750 --> 02:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
children represent D in terms of that
 
02:38:37.070 --> 02:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
would it be advantageous for the funds
 
02:38:38.830 --> 02:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
to follow the student to the next
 
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
District they do they do yes so those so
 
02:38:44.830 --> 02:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
it's paid one year in AAR and so the way
 
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
it works is so if I attended conquered
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
high school for half the year and my
 
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
cost for
 
02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um and conquered High School U
 
02:38:55.630 --> 02:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
or conquered School District it's
 
02:38:57.309 --> 02:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
probably an auto District placement but
 
02:38:59.429 --> 02:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
conquered School District um occurred
 
02:39:01.550 --> 02:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
$50,000 of my cost and then I moved to
 
02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
hopkington halfway through the year and
 
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
then hopkington paid for the rest of the
 
02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
50,000 um we split that up for to the
 
02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
different schools because it's because
 
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
we don't make the so we just made a
 
02:39:13.950 --> 02:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
payment in January of 25 um that was for
 
02:39:16.750 --> 02:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
school year 23 24 so the way it works is
 
02:39:18.469 --> 02:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
school districts go through the entire
 
02:39:20.830 --> 02:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
year they figure out all of the costs
 
02:39:22.349 --> 02:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
associated with a certain child they
 
02:39:23.590 --> 02:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
submit that to the Department of
 
02:39:25.269 --> 02:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
Education the Department of Education
 
02:39:28.030 --> 02:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
calculates what the allowable costs are
 
02:39:30.190 --> 02:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
and then what the formula would project
 
02:39:31.870 --> 02:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
and then the pration and then we make
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
the payments in the in the following
 
02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:40.269 align:start position:0%
the payments in the in the following
fiscal

02:39:40.269 --> 02:39:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
year other questions on this topic okay
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
I guess you are released thank you for
 
02:39:52.670 --> 02:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:54.590 --> 02:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
same same question relative to building
 
02:39:57.510 --> 02:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
Aid um what do you go ahead because the
 
02:39:59.790 --> 02:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
committee we've presented some materials
 
02:40:01.550 --> 02:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
um you know we explained how the tail
 
02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
works the new projects Works everything
 
02:40:05.469 --> 02:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that you are in a place
 
02:40:09.469 --> 02:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
to make a decision in what three weeks
 
02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
here two weeks now what what else do you
 
02:40:15.469 --> 02:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
need from me and my team to to make you
 
02:40:18.030 --> 02:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
successful I'm interested to hear about
 
02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:19.550 align:start position:0%
successful I'm interested to hear about
um

02:40:19.550 --> 02:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
the applicants that are currently in the
 
02:40:25.070 --> 02:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
pipeline for this goor round who
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
potentially will not be serviced so I'm
 
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
just wondering is it the same folks from
 
02:40:31.990 --> 02:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
before is it a bunch of new people what
 
02:40:34.510 --> 02:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
what does that so um class look like you
 
02:40:36.389 --> 02:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
may remember me saying that there was a
 
02:40:38.190 --> 02:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
change in the law that was probably
 
02:40:39.469 --> 02:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
helpful to the way the building aid
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
program works but is going to upset
 
02:40:43.469 --> 02:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
division 2 and this is specifically what
 
02:40:46.990 --> 02:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
I mean um so the way that program was
 
02:40:48.510 --> 02:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
changed is the Department of Education
 
02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
accepts application s annually now each
 
02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
year we have a list we keep that list
 
02:40:55.510 --> 02:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
once you are on the list you get to stay
 
02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
on that list until you're offered
 
02:40:58.950 --> 02:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
funding um so this is really the first
 
02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
year of that happening in the and so you
 
02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
being on division 2 before are used to
 
02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
us showing up with the list and saying
 
02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
here's who the funding would go to
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
because in the past the department had
 
02:41:09.550 --> 02:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
that information by January 1 of each
 
02:41:12.910 --> 02:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
year um so um I did present the
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee a copy on February 5th um of
 
02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
the existing list and I can send that
 
02:41:19.309 --> 02:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
again if you don't have it but that
 
02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's what our existing list is um we
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
are accepting applications right now and
 
02:41:26.750 --> 02:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
should have additional projects added to
 
02:41:29.750 --> 02:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
that list um after they are ranked so
 
02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
the applications are due to the
 
02:41:33.429 --> 02:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Education on April 1st
 
02:41:34.750 --> 02:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
then the Department of Education goes
 
02:41:36.429 --> 02:41:36.439 align:start position:0%
through a fairly rigorous ranking
 
02:41:38.190 --> 02:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
process and then the State Board of
 
02:41:40.750 --> 02:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
Education will validate that list and
 
02:41:43.389 --> 02:41:43.399 align:start position:0%
publish that list I believe it's by July
 
02:41:45.349 --> 02:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
1 of each year but I'm not actually sure
 
02:41:47.550 --> 02:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
on the publication date of that list so
 
02:41:49.309 --> 02:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
it will not be available in time for for
 
02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
the budget however you have a list of I
 
02:41:53.230 --> 02:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
think about 13 projects right now so I
 
02:41:56.070 --> 02:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
think it's safe to say that um if you
 
02:41:58.670 --> 02:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
were to provide funding in building
 
02:42:01.389 --> 02:42:01.399 align:start position:0%
eight it would likely go to the 13 that
 
02:42:03.190 --> 02:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
are on that list before it would go to
 
02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:06.190 align:start position:0%
are on that list before it would go to
new

02:42:06.190 --> 02:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:09.790 --> 02:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
applications and just as a followup um
 
02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
if we're only appropriating for the tail
 
02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
that means folks who have spent money on
 
02:42:17.790 --> 02:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
um their application
 
02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
process um but because we're not funding
 
02:42:22.190 --> 02:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
any new projects we'll miss out on
 
02:42:25.550 --> 02:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
another cycle that is correct um that is
 
02:42:27.309 --> 02:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
one of the advantages of the new program
 
02:42:29.309 --> 02:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
though because in the past you had to
 
02:42:31.630 --> 02:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
submit an application each year for the
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
list and now when you've you've
 
02:42:34.910 --> 02:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
submitted that application you get to
 
02:42:37.950 --> 02:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
stay on that list and there's um a way
 
02:42:40.670 --> 02:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
for uh schools to update their costs
 
02:42:43.150 --> 02:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
associated with the project and stay on
 
02:42:44.830 --> 02:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
the list and that's that's one of the
 
02:42:46.269 --> 02:42:46.279 align:start position:0%
things that was heavily talked about and
 
02:42:48.349 --> 02:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
debated when um the program was was
 
02:42:48.359 --> 02:42:50.630 align:start position:0%
debated when um the program was was
Rewritten

02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
Rewritten
 
02:42:52.830 --> 02:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
repr papich thank you so just a quick
 
02:42:55.070 --> 02:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
question which you kind of answered but
 
02:42:56.429 --> 02:42:56.439 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure I understand it
 
02:42:57.990 --> 02:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
correctly obviously it's a good thing
 
02:42:59.550 --> 02:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
that people don't have to reapply every
 
02:43:01.710 --> 02:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
year especially since most information
 
02:43:05.349 --> 02:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
is the same so why would you have to um
 
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
but I think you indicated that we don't
 
02:43:10.670 --> 02:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
really reced the list every year right
 
02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
so if I was number one last year will I
 
02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
still be number one this year or at the
 
02:43:18.590 --> 02:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
end of the submission period we take the
 
02:43:20.110 --> 02:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
people who were already on the list and
 
02:43:21.830 --> 02:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
the new people on the list and Shuffle
 
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
everything from scratch we do we do not
 
02:43:26.070 --> 02:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
rerank the list so who is number one
 
02:43:28.269 --> 02:43:28.279 align:start position:0%
right now will stay number one and like
 
02:43:30.670 --> 02:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
one through 13 or 1 through 17 on the
 
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
list will stay exactly the same and then
 
02:43:35.389 --> 02:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
number one from the new ranking pool on
 
02:43:37.550 --> 02:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
April 1st this year will become the next
 
02:43:40.110 --> 02:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
one on the list understood so there is
 
02:43:42.830 --> 02:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
no situation in which the ranking could
 
02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
change based on the changes in the
 
02:43:48.429 --> 02:43:48.439 align:start position:0%
district circumstances over the years so
 
02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
what could change change um is the
 
02:43:53.630 --> 02:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
percentage the state would provide so um
 
02:43:55.710 --> 02:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
at the time when we award the money a
 
02:43:58.030 --> 02:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
school district is eligible for 30 to
 
02:44:00.910 --> 02:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
60% of the project costs um when you
 
02:44:02.750 --> 02:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
look at their equalized valuation and
 
02:44:05.469 --> 02:44:05.479 align:start position:0%
median family income um or might be free
 
02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch percentage um and so
 
02:44:10.870 --> 02:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
that amount could change so if a school
 
02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
district were to get substantially poor
 
02:44:14.590 --> 02:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
so they submitted two years ago they're
 
02:44:16.510 --> 02:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
on our existing list right now and all
 
02:44:17.790 --> 02:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
they all of a sudden they have a lot
 
02:44:20.349 --> 02:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
more free and reduced lunch kids in the
 
02:44:22.389 --> 02:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
district they're maybe they were only
 
02:44:24.269 --> 02:44:24.279 align:start position:0%
going to get 30% of their project in the
 
02:44:26.910 --> 02:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
past they may get 60% of their project
 
02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
this year okay but none of the factors
 
02:44:30.990 --> 02:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
that go into the ranking would be
 
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
reassessed correct oh yeah well that's a
 
02:44:36.349 --> 02:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
policy thing obviously the department
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
does what the legislation ask them to do
 
02:44:41.630 --> 02:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
I find it to be a bit strange policy
 
02:44:44.230 --> 02:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
that if a new school has a compelling
 
02:44:45.990 --> 02:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
case that would normally put them at
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
number one they cannot get onto the list
 
02:44:51.030 --> 02:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
because the first 10 spots are taken but
 
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
as I said that's the legislation and the
 
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
policy and we deal with it as is right
 
02:44:56.790 --> 02:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
now so thank
 
02:45:00.070 --> 02:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Ro but that changes
 
02:45:02.309 --> 02:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
if somebody drops off right we talked
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
about that somebody might drop off and
 
02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
then the next one comes up next one
 
02:45:07.550 --> 02:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
comes up right and then there's others
 
02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
that probably decide well we can't do
 
02:45:10.910 --> 02:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
this because there's no funding so you
 
02:45:13.550 --> 02:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
know correct correct and they don't
 
02:45:14.990 --> 02:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to drop off either they
 
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
just can say we're not we're not going
 
02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
to do it this year they'll still stay on
 
02:45:19.870 --> 02:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
there but somebody below them the money
 
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you um
 
02:45:25.750 --> 02:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
school districts have to have Community
 
02:45:27.190 --> 02:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
buying to do a project you know they
 
02:45:29.429 --> 02:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
have to raise their own funds right do
 
02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
warrants run out are there is there a
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
time limit on warrants I just I'm asking
 
02:45:34.910 --> 02:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
because I simply don't know um is if a
 
02:45:36.429 --> 02:45:36.439 align:start position:0%
school is bumped and bumped and bumped
 
02:45:37.630 --> 02:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
over like you know we're not there's
 
02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
nothing on the budget for this year so
 
02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's putting it out for another one to
 
02:45:44.150 --> 02:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
two years for schools do warrants get
 
02:45:45.910 --> 02:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
reconsidered or do you know anything
 
02:45:48.030 --> 02:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
about that I don't CU they could lose
 
02:45:49.309 --> 02:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
their they could lose their commity
 
02:45:51.590 --> 02:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
support potentially yeah I I think they
 
02:45:53.190 --> 02:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
would have to put it back on the ballot
 
02:45:56.349 --> 02:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
because they would have to do a bond
 
02:45:58.830 --> 02:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
based on the time of the warrant and I
 
02:46:00.429 --> 02:46:00.439 align:start position:0%
I'll verify that for you but I'm I'm
 
02:46:01.870 --> 02:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that it would need to be
 
02:46:04.030 --> 02:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
come on MAR Cas you're needed don't be
 
02:46:05.790 --> 02:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable specific question I don't
 
02:46:08.269 --> 02:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
think okay just just might as well be
 
02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
there just in case come on up Mark with
 
02:46:14.309 --> 02:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:17.630 --> 02:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
what's repres papovich on the warrant
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
article the warrant article is good for
 
02:46:22.030 --> 02:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
that year so you got your approval in
 
02:46:23.910 --> 02:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
March if you happen to get the funding
 
02:46:25.590 --> 02:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
rate you can go forward if not you're
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
going to have to go back on the ballot
 
02:46:30.429 --> 02:46:30.439 align:start position:0%
every year so that I mean unless the
 
02:46:33.389 --> 02:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
warrant language specifies it's a you
 
02:46:49.030 --> 02:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
and so on so the and part of the way the
 
02:46:56.110 --> 02:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
the program was redesigned was because
 
02:46:58.429 --> 02:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
to allow schools to have an idea that
 
02:47:00.349 --> 02:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
the state would be providing funding so
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
now a town Bas the formula the way that
 
02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
kind of works now is the state budget
 
02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
will be finalized then we will be able
 
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
to offer funding to certain people on
 
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
the list then they can take that and
 
02:47:13.309 --> 02:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
generate their warrant and then go to
 
02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
vote and they have up to three times
 
02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
based on the timing of you know when
 
02:47:19.590 --> 02:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
when the funding is is made a aailable
 
02:47:22.230 --> 02:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
to pass that locally um where in the
 
02:47:23.870 --> 02:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
past it kind of was backwards and then
 
02:47:25.870 --> 02:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
we were having people not be able to
 
02:47:27.870 --> 02:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that and that's what
 
02:47:30.349 --> 02:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
we don't want
 
02:47:30.359 --> 02:47:31.870 align:start position:0%
we don't want
so

02:47:31.870 --> 02:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:35.389 align:start position:0%
so
so

02:47:35.389 --> 02:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:37.710 --> 02:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
um without having any funding at all
 
02:47:40.150 --> 02:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
this year no funding projects that could
 
02:47:42.349 --> 02:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
potentially go back to some schools
 
02:47:45.269 --> 02:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
would communities who passed a warrant
 
02:47:48.309 --> 02:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh the warrant after a year would not be
 
02:47:50.110 --> 02:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
enforced anymore and they would have to
 
02:47:52.469 --> 02:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
do another warrant in order to continue
 
02:47:54.750 --> 02:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
potentially to get refunding is that
 
02:47:56.190 --> 02:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
kind of what is that what I'm hearing
 
02:47:58.110 --> 02:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
assuming that the warrant is contingent
 
02:48:00.349 --> 02:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
on them receiving State funding um they
 
02:48:02.190 --> 02:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
could certainly go through go through
 
02:48:03.710 --> 02:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
and build the project entirely with
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
local funds yeah right um after
 
02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
everything has been approved I'm trying
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
to think I'm trying to avoid a um a
 
02:48:13.710 --> 02:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
school kind of getting into getting
 
02:48:16.550 --> 02:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
stuck in the mud here um when do they
 
02:48:18.110 --> 02:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
start the project so assuming that they
 
02:48:20.110 --> 02:48:20.120 align:start position:0%
have the warrant and they've been
 
02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
approved um how much time do they have
 
02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
before they can actually I mean that
 
02:48:27.590 --> 02:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
really that really depends locally um
 
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
because the school districts have to get
 
02:48:30.550 --> 02:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
all of the contracts in order and and
 
02:48:32.230 --> 02:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
some of them are ready to go basically
 
02:48:34.590 --> 02:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
the day that warrant passes I mean
 
02:48:36.150 --> 02:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
really the warant is for the next school
 
02:48:38.389 --> 02:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
year to so right now in March they're
 
02:48:39.950 --> 02:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
voting and for the next budget year so
 
02:48:41.790 --> 02:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
you really need to wait to get that but
 
02:48:46.510 --> 02:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
board I will you know obviously second
 
02:48:51.910 --> 02:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
your earlier comments they are correct
 
02:48:54.030 --> 02:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
some districts are ready to put a shovel
 
02:48:55.910 --> 02:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the ground really quickly some may
 
02:48:57.910 --> 02:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
need to do a bit of preliminary work
 
02:49:00.269 --> 02:49:00.279 align:start position:0%
retain something and so on I would say
 
02:49:03.070 --> 02:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
that based on my understanding of what
 
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
has happened in the state most schools
 
02:49:07.389 --> 02:49:07.399 align:start position:0%
are pretty close to shovels otherwise
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
they would have a hard time coming with
 
02:49:12.070 --> 02:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
a good estimate to put on the warrant so
 
02:49:14.349 --> 02:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
because of that they tend to really kind
 
02:49:16.790 --> 02:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
of have it Tien down but again year over
 
02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
year you have new contracts inflation
 
02:49:20.429 --> 02:49:20.439 align:start position:0%
change in availability of suppliers and
 
02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
so on right yeah t typically the project
 
02:49:25.630 --> 02:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
plan is very well developed at the time
 
02:49:27.190 --> 02:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
I mean it's needed for the application
 
02:49:29.349 --> 02:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the architect work has been
 
02:49:31.510 --> 02:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
done design work the engineering design
 
02:49:32.910 --> 02:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
work has been done relative to the
 
02:49:34.349 --> 02:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
project to help them associated with
 
02:49:36.550 --> 02:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
costs so it's really just where they
 
02:49:37.830 --> 02:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
like on getting all their contracts
 
02:49:39.910 --> 02:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
signed going out to RFP and all of all
 
02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
of that work yeah and very importantly
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
the doe does not impose a timeline once
 
02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
you are approved they will just
 
02:49:47.309 --> 02:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
patiently wait as you are going through
 
02:49:48.830 --> 02:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
your stages and wait for you to meet
 
02:49:50.309 --> 02:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
your milestone in these bir so it's
 
02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate right the doe doesn't have a
 
02:49:54.750 --> 02:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
now you got to finish in 5 years or your
 
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
funds are gone finish corre but you do
 
02:49:58.950 --> 02:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
have to start your project within a
 
02:50:00.510 --> 02:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
certain of course you cannot just sit on
 
02:50:02.429 --> 02:50:02.439 align:start position:0%
the funds forever but as long as
 
02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
progress is made there is a lot of
 
02:50:05.950 --> 02:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility from the doe in terms of the
 
02:50:08.750 --> 02:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
timeline and how long it may take we are
 
02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
actually working with a school right now
 
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
who I think was approved in 2019 to
 
02:50:22.110 --> 02:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:24.630 --> 02:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
okay looks like we're clear on the
 
02:50:28.030 --> 02:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
building Aid so I guess you can be
 
02:50:32.750 --> 02:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
excused Mark have a great
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
day Mark is out of oh he's adequacy who
 
02:50:37.309 --> 02:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
was the other person had to go was it
 
02:50:39.190 --> 02:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
just Mark oh just Mark yeah and I was
 
02:50:40.550 --> 02:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
going he's not really
 
02:50:42.750 --> 02:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
going uh do you want to do lunch though
 
02:50:44.269 --> 02:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
now that it's almost noon yeah that's
 
02:50:46.269 --> 02:50:46.279 align:start position:0%
what I'm wondering so um that was my
 
02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
next question should we
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
this is a commission for our committee a
 
02:50:52.550 --> 02:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
question for our committee do you all
 
02:50:54.229 --> 02:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
want a break now rather than sort of
 
02:50:55.950 --> 02:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
starting something and interrupting it
 
02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:57.910 align:start position:0%
starting something and interrupting it
and

02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:00.990 --> 02:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
then go ahead um so kayin brought
 
02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself Mark Mell Bureau
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
School finance department of education
 
02:51:06.510 --> 02:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
um just one thing kayin brought up about
 
02:51:07.990 --> 02:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of how special education
 
02:51:09.110 --> 02:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
Aid work and I think we've talked about
 
02:51:11.910 --> 02:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
this as a committee before um so when
 
02:51:13.910 --> 02:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
districts T typically you're doing your
 
02:51:15.389 --> 02:51:15.399 align:start position:0%
budget throughout the fall and then
 
02:51:16.670 --> 02:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
you're presenting it to the voters in
 
02:51:18.750 --> 02:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
the spring and so they have to plug in
 
02:51:19.750 --> 02:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates and they're
 
02:51:22.309 --> 02:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
essentially telling their voters um they
 
02:51:23.830 --> 02:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
make their best guess and they don't
 
02:51:24.990 --> 02:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
have they don't know what the future
 
02:51:28.389 --> 02:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
holds um so they'll plug in a number for
 
02:51:29.710 --> 02:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
special education Revenue that they
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
think they're going to get and they'll
 
02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
tell their voters that and then if you
 
02:51:34.150 --> 02:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
go to town meeting of course people say
 
02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
I can't want to don't want don't want to
 
02:51:37.150 --> 02:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
give you an estimated tax rate because
 
02:51:38.670 --> 02:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to estimate but they'll
 
02:51:40.750 --> 02:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
try their best to give the voters an
 
02:51:42.349 --> 02:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
idea of what they think is going to be
 
02:51:45.790 --> 02:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
the tax bill um and so um when they're
 
02:51:47.269 --> 02:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
making those estimates they might assume
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
special education Aid will continue
 
02:51:52.150 --> 02:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
without pration and so if pration does
 
02:51:53.950 --> 02:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
happen later basically the revenue
 
02:51:55.429 --> 02:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
estimates that they talked with their
 
02:51:57.190 --> 02:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
voters when they passed the budget it's
 
02:52:00.309 --> 02:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
not going to be there so um then when
 
02:52:02.429 --> 02:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
when we have more recent uh more current
 
02:52:04.550 --> 02:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
data and taxes are being set that was
 
02:52:06.389 --> 02:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
that's when that pration really gets
 
02:52:10.190 --> 02:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
communicated out um to the uh saus and
 
02:52:12.229 --> 02:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
so from there maybe they might have
 
02:52:13.710 --> 02:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
assume that special education was going
 
02:52:15.870 --> 02:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
to come in it gets paraded and then the
 
02:52:17.550 --> 02:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
tax bill is higher than maybe they
 
02:52:19.750 --> 02:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
advertised to town me meeting so that's
 
02:52:21.469 --> 02:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the effect of pration as
 
02:52:22.750 --> 02:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
far as they're expecting that money to
 
02:52:24.830 --> 02:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
come in didn't fully come in it got it
 
02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
got prated and so that's sort of
 
02:52:28.590 --> 02:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
mechanically what happens at the
 
02:52:28.600 --> 02:52:31.870 align:start position:0%
mechanically what happens at the
district

02:52:31.870 --> 02:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
level fully agreed in an Ideal World the
 
02:52:37.150 --> 02:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
school district being aware of the
 
02:52:39.750 --> 02:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
possibility of pration would have some
 
02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
unassigned f fund balance they can use
 
02:52:43.910 --> 02:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
rather than increased taxes or would
 
02:52:46.990 --> 02:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
have some Reserve funds set aside for
 
02:52:48.870 --> 02:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
special education but I will say on the
 
02:52:50.750 --> 02:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
record that that's an ideal practice and
 
02:52:52.670 --> 02:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
not every District in a position to
 
02:52:55.190 --> 02:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
implement those you know but those those
 
02:52:57.670 --> 02:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
practices would decrease the odds of
 
02:52:59.670 --> 02:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
having to send a tax bill that's higher
 
02:53:01.590 --> 02:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
than expected but again not every
 
02:53:03.790 --> 02:53:03.800 align:start position:0%
district has the ability to do so and
 
02:53:05.469 --> 02:53:05.479 align:start position:0%
the districts that are more at risk are
 
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
the very small ones where just a little
 
02:53:10.870 --> 02:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
bit of variation can be a very big you
 
02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
know impact relative to the overall size
 
02:53:15.429 --> 02:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
of the budget when when I'm talking with
 
02:53:16.910 --> 02:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
districts too I always say use your
 
02:53:18.309 --> 02:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
professional judgment as far as coming
 
02:53:20.670 --> 02:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
up with Revenue numbers so with adequacy
 
02:53:23.150 --> 02:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh we typically say don't budget 100%
 
02:53:25.990 --> 02:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
budget 95% because that's the guarantee
 
02:53:28.110 --> 02:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
um districts could budget for 100% And
 
02:53:31.110 --> 02:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
tell their voters that number um so um
 
02:53:32.429 --> 02:53:32.439 align:start position:0%
they have they have a lot of discretion
 
02:53:33.750 --> 02:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
there as far as how they talk with their
 
02:53:36.429 --> 02:53:36.439 align:start position:0%
voters uh but that's just how that how
 
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
that works but if I'm not mistaken
 
02:53:41.950 --> 02:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
despite the shortfall in special
 
02:53:44.990 --> 02:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
education funding in school budgets
 
02:53:46.830 --> 02:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
there was not a shortfall in overall
 
02:53:48.910 --> 02:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
funding I.E they had surpluses in other
 
02:53:50.670 --> 02:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
areas of their budgets that actually
 
02:53:55.110 --> 02:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
covered their cost is that that um so
 
02:53:57.229 --> 02:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
depends on District by District but over
 
02:53:59.510 --> 02:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
but overall there's there's excess there
 
02:54:01.830 --> 02:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
was excess funding and then that lapses
 
02:54:03.389 --> 02:54:03.399 align:start position:0%
back to the taxpayers in the form of an
 
02:54:06.269 --> 02:54:06.279 align:start position:0%
unassigned fund balance or not or or not
 
02:54:08.630 --> 02:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's for some districts it does not yeah
 
02:54:10.670 --> 02:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear it actually was not
 
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
like they did not get like they didn't
 
02:54:13.950 --> 02:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
have the adequate funding in their
 
02:54:15.950 --> 02:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
school budgets for the most part so make
 
02:54:18.429 --> 02:54:18.439 align:start position:0%
that did you another they did they did
 
02:54:20.190 --> 02:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
have adequate funding because they had
 
02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
surpluses in other areas of their
 
02:54:25.830 --> 02:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
budgets um represent thank you um you
 
02:54:29.229 --> 02:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
know a student comes into a classroom uh
 
02:54:31.150 --> 02:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
with the special needs um they're very
 
02:54:33.910 --> 02:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
high can can you speak to consistency of
 
02:54:35.870 --> 02:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
what those costs are across years
 
02:54:38.190 --> 02:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
because I think in most cases the
 
02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
student would stay in the same school
 
02:54:41.630 --> 02:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
district the student would still have
 
02:54:45.030 --> 02:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
the same issues one year to the next so
 
02:54:47.110 --> 02:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
can does is there anything to be learned
 
02:54:48.990 --> 02:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
by the school district in terms of of U
 
02:54:51.070 --> 02:54:51.080 align:start position:0%
projecting some of these costs because
 
02:54:53.950 --> 02:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
of consistency of the needs of that
 
02:54:55.830 --> 02:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
student through that that particular
 
02:54:57.590 --> 02:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
school do you know understand what I
 
02:54:58.750 --> 02:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
can't really speak to the individual
 
02:55:01.349 --> 02:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
student level cost um but I think I
 
02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
think you're I think what you're saying
 
02:55:04.510 --> 02:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
is reasonable in a sense that the cost
 
02:55:06.309 --> 02:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
you had the previous year for the same
 
02:55:08.030 --> 02:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
student you'd expect it to be pretty
 
02:55:11.190 --> 02:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
well correlated with the next year um uh
 
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
but I can't really speak to that in any
 
02:55:14.229 --> 02:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
like data
 
02:55:16.590 --> 02:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
way but this is exactly why this whole
 
02:55:17.790 --> 02:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
special education thing is so
 
02:55:20.150 --> 02:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
frustrating it's not about individual I
 
02:55:21.269 --> 02:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
don't think it's about individual
 
02:55:22.950 --> 02:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
student cause changing from year to year
 
02:55:24.190 --> 02:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
it's something else that's going on in
 
02:55:25.950 --> 02:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
the system one thing that happened this
 
02:55:27.630 --> 02:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
particular year was this is the first
 
02:55:29.950 --> 02:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
year that we had you may recall that we
 
02:55:32.269 --> 02:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
extended the age at which you aged out
 
02:55:35.750 --> 02:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
by Year and that probably contributed
 
02:55:37.309 --> 02:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
something I'm not actually able to get

the accurate answers to how much that
 
02:55:41.150 --> 02:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
contributed um but in any case things
 
02:55:42.469 --> 02:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
like that happen as well but there's
 
02:55:44.030 --> 02:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
more going on than that and there's
 
02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
definitely a problem with special
 
02:55:46.190 --> 02:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
education fun and I don't mean at the
 
02:55:51.469 --> 02:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:55.150 --> 02:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
everywhere oh anyway I'm sorry uh any
 
02:55:57.510 --> 02:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
other questions related to what are they
 
02:56:01.229 --> 02:56:01.239 align:start position:0%
related to what are you speaking on

04:17:09.870 --> 04:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
unique in a sense the other divisions um
 
04:17:11.910 --> 04:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't deal with Surplus statements as as
 
04:17:14.750 --> 04:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
frequent as this commit does so um when
 
04:17:17.189 --> 04:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
you're willing or when you're um uh to
 
04:17:18.030 --> 04:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
the point where you're going to build
 
04:17:19.870 --> 04:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
your education budget the Surplus
 
04:17:21.550 --> 04:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
statement is going to be a key part of
 
04:17:22.870 --> 04:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
that because it's going to tell you
 
04:17:25.790 --> 04:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
Mickey's going to itemize it out um uh
 
04:17:27.389 --> 04:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
as far as where what kind of education
 
04:17:28.510 --> 04:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
programs you're going to fund through
 
04:17:30.830 --> 04:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund now as as
 
04:17:32.670 --> 04:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
Mickey and and chairman Wier talked
 
04:17:35.229 --> 04:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
about there's discuss there's always
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
conversations about changing what the
 
04:17:38.349 --> 04:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is going to look
 
04:17:41.630 --> 04:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
like uh previous years the house has res
 
04:17:43.389 --> 04:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
shifted the education trust fund pretty
 
04:17:45.389 --> 04:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
dramatically and the Senate has put it
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
back to where maybe it was historically
 
04:17:52.229 --> 04:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
but oh sorry sorry sorry sorry uh uh put
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
it back to um uh imaginary stupid I'll
 
04:17:57.710 --> 04:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
try to use I'll try to use be careful
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
with my words put it back to the way the
 
04:18:03.429 --> 04:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
governor presented it or Governor 35%
 
04:18:05.910 --> 04:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
right right right right no went to 22%
 
04:18:08.189 --> 04:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
they went to 44 CH chairman is correct
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
the most idiotic thing um so but but you
 
04:18:12.870 --> 04:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
but you you make your decisions as far
 
04:18:14.109 --> 04:18:14.119 align:start position:0%
as how you want to design the education
 
04:18:16.269 --> 04:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
trust fund um there's some back back and
 
04:18:17.349 --> 04:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
forth with the House and Senate there's
 
04:18:18.910 --> 04:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
some history there as you can as you can
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
see um so but the the education trust
 
04:18:23.550 --> 04:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
fund we're working with is the one the
 
04:18:24.910 --> 04:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
governor has recommended so that's the
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
one we're going to talk about now um
 
04:18:28.910 --> 04:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
just just a heads up conversations
 
04:18:30.510 --> 04:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
obviously about it changing um just be
 
04:18:32.429 --> 04:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
mindful of that and just to be clear
 
04:18:34.030 --> 04:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't about changing education
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
funding it's just a question of the
 
04:18:38.790 --> 04:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
balance between the education trust fund
 
04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
and the general fund dollars where they
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
sit before they're spent and and that's
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
another thing too is the revenue revenue
 
04:18:47.870 --> 04:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
splits you know what business that's all
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to talk about that
 
04:18:49.630 --> 04:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
today and that's not something the
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
department does that's something Dr does
 
04:18:52.189 --> 04:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
and that's something this committee
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
weighs and means all the legislature you
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
make those decisions um and it is
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
important for building your budget to
 
04:18:58.990 --> 04:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
know where the revenue is going to be to
 
04:19:00.590 --> 04:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
fund your programs um but what we're
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to talk about today is those
 
04:19:04.189 --> 04:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
programs um which chairman ER talked
 
04:19:09.269 --> 04:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
about um so um the other key thing again
 
04:19:11.510 --> 04:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh seasoned veterans know about this the
 
04:19:14.710 --> 04:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
way you budget education funding there's
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
hb1 which we just went through today we
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
went through all those Appropriations
 
04:19:20.030 --> 04:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
and then there's warrants so you got to
 
04:19:21.710 --> 04:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
know the difference between the two when
 
04:19:23.710 --> 04:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
you give an appropriation in hb1 and
 
04:19:25.750 --> 04:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
there is no warrant connected to it no
 
04:19:27.510 --> 04:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
warrant Authority connected to it that's
 
04:19:29.750 --> 04:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
it you've now finalize your funding for
 
04:19:31.870 --> 04:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
that so if we look at State Testing if
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
you fund State Testing at 4.5 million in
 
04:19:38.510 --> 04:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
hb1 uh uh for fiscal year 26 that's it
 
04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's no warrant for that there so
 
04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
there's no additional liability
 
04:19:44.109 --> 04:19:44.119 align:start position:0%
Financial liability to the state you've
 
04:19:46.830 --> 04:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
set it to what it is um but there's
 
04:19:49.269 --> 04:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
certain programs that have warrants so
 
04:19:51.389 --> 04:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
district adequacy has a warrant so
 
04:19:54.790 --> 04:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
whatever you put into hb1 you could put0
 
04:19:57.309 --> 04:19:57.319 align:start position:0%
in hb1 we have the authority and are
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
mandated to spend that money anyways so
 
04:20:02.630 --> 04:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
instead of if if say you
 
04:20:06.070 --> 04:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
put0 in hb1 for district adequacy we are
 
04:20:07.510 --> 04:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
going to request that money and we are
 
04:20:08.950 --> 04:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
going to spend that money because the
 
04:20:10.870 --> 04:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
law tells us how to spend that money and
 
04:20:12.950 --> 04:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
gives us the authority to do so and M us
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
to do so so with District adequacy
 
04:20:18.670 --> 04:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
putting an hb1 number it's more just a
 
04:20:21.269 --> 04:20:21.279 align:start position:0%
budgeting process um but it doesn't
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
actually we have warrant Authority so if
 
04:20:24.870 --> 04:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
you put zero in there um if you
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
underfund it we're going to go draw on
 
04:20:29.149 --> 04:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
that warrant and if you uh uh
 
04:20:30.590 --> 04:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
underfunded we're just going to lapse it
 
04:20:32.469 --> 04:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
back to the education trust
 
04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
fund so basically just to summarize what
 
04:20:37.630 --> 04:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
you are saying is that the adequacy
 
04:20:39.309 --> 04:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
spending is driven by the number of
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
students and the amount per student and
 
04:20:44.109 --> 04:20:44.119 align:start position:0%
their eligibility anything we put in hbi
 
04:20:46.670 --> 04:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
hb1 is our best guess as to how much
 
04:20:48.309 --> 04:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
that will be but at the end of the day
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
we'll spend whatever we'll spend Based
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
on data we don't have yet that that's
 
04:20:52.990 --> 04:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
correct and and and what we're going to
 
04:20:55.349 --> 04:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
talk about is if you're not going to
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
change state law so if you're not going
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
to change adequacy in state law and
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
there's some bills that are going to end
 
04:21:01.510 --> 04:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
up in this committee or uh that um
 
04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
actually haven't gone through the
 
04:21:03.630 --> 04:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
process but there's usually bills that
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
are referred to this committee um that
 
04:21:07.950 --> 04:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
seek to change adequacy that's actually
 
04:21:09.830 --> 04:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
changing the program and that's actually
 
04:21:12.630 --> 04:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
changing uh how many Stu might students
 
04:21:15.070 --> 04:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
might be in in the program um that's
 
04:21:17.229 --> 04:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
changing um U the actual amounts each
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
student aid amount could be so that
 
04:21:20.910 --> 04:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
would actually change state law and that
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
would change the amount the state has to
 
04:21:24.550 --> 04:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
pay um but for the numbers we're talking
 
04:21:26.269 --> 04:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
about here it's you coming up with your
 
04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
best estimate as far as what you think
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be in the future based on
 
04:21:31.389 --> 04:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
the law that you're enacting and based
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
on the student data you have and so
 
04:21:34.630 --> 04:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
we're just going to walk through some of
 
04:21:38.750 --> 04:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
that right now any questions no okay I
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
just want to iterate that adequacy was
 
04:21:44.710 --> 04:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
just for adequacy it didn't include
 
04:21:47.550 --> 04:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
building Aid it didn't include special
 
04:21:49.229 --> 04:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
ed it didn't include tuition and
 
04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
transportation those are always funded
 
04:21:55.269 --> 04:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
from general fund except for this last
 
04:21:59.349 --> 04:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh budget which was you
 
04:22:01.830 --> 04:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
know which ended up with a big Surplus
 
04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
that we couldn't spend anywhere else
 
04:22:04.870 --> 04:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
yeah if you look at the history and I
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
think um um uh the commissioner and
 
04:22:09.510 --> 04:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
Tammy's uh document will show you they I
 
04:22:10.630 --> 04:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
don't think the history goes back as far
 
04:22:11.790 --> 04:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
as you're talking about but they'll show
 
04:22:14.309 --> 04:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
you the history of fund moving around
 
04:22:15.630 --> 04:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
general fund programs moving to the
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and so uh there's
 
04:22:19.229 --> 04:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
been a lot of changes throughout the
 
04:22:21.229 --> 04:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
years and it's expanded the programs
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
used by the education trust fund that's
 
04:22:27.550 --> 04:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
correct um so uh the first one we're
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
going to talk about is District
 
04:22:31.910 --> 04:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy so District adequacy the
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
governor has recommended uh uh a billion
 
04:22:39.349 --> 04:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
80 million um that's for fiscal year 26
 
04:22:41.790 --> 04:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
and then for fiscal year 27 so if you
 
04:22:43.469 --> 04:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
look at page 2 your sheet it has the
 
04:22:45.229 --> 04:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
town by Town you're all familiar with
 
04:22:46.830 --> 04:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 26 estimate we've
 
04:22:49.469 --> 04:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
provided that before um this is just the
 
04:22:52.349 --> 04:22:52.359 align:start position:0%
town by town to get to what the uh the
 
04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
governor has uh um put in the budget for
 
04:23:01.790 --> 04:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
hb1 um that billion 82 million so that
 
04:23:04.990 --> 04:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
is fiscal year 27 and so uh the
 
04:23:06.990 --> 04:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
assumptions used in that there are some
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
assumptions used in that uh is
 
04:23:13.469 --> 04:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
essentially a 1.2% decline an enrollment
 
04:23:13.479 --> 04:23:14.630 align:start position:0%
essentially a 1.2% decline an enrollment
between

04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
26 uh um it's it's going to be 26 to 27
 
04:23:19.229 --> 04:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
but really it's going to be school year
 
04:23:22.269 --> 04:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
25 to school year 26 because adequacy is
 
04:23:23.550 --> 04:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
one year
 
04:23:28.349 --> 04:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
behind um so that billion 82 assumes
 
04:23:32.349 --> 04:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
6.6% property growth um which is the
 
04:23:35.149 --> 04:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
historical average um that property
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
growth number is not current property
 
04:23:41.229 --> 04:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
it's the property uh now have to theatee
 
04:23:43.670 --> 04:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lag on the property collection
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
so it's not going to be 6.6 as in um the
 
04:23:47.229 --> 04:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
property data that's going to come in
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
this September it's from the previous
 
04:23:53.149 --> 04:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
September um September 2024 once that
 
04:23:56.269 --> 04:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
data has been equalized and analyzed by
 
04:23:58.670 --> 04:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
Dr basically we're assuming the growth
 
04:24:00.510 --> 04:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
of that data is going to be
 
04:24:02.750 --> 04:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
6.6% which is pretty consistent with
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
historical property growth um so um as
 
04:24:09.349 --> 04:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
you all receive the adequacy take a
 
04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
question not as not as much a question
 
04:24:13.630 --> 04:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
but just to make sure everybody's on the
 
04:24:15.389 --> 04:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
same page my understanding is that we
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
are talking about the increase in
 
04:24:19.550 --> 04:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
property values because certain elements
 
04:24:21.550 --> 04:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
of the formula are calculated based on
 
04:24:24.309 --> 04:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
equalized property values so if property
 
04:24:26.429 --> 04:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
values increase really high we may have
 
04:24:28.469 --> 04:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
to pay less funds in certain parts of
 
04:24:31.030 --> 04:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
the formula and so on again we have some
 
04:24:33.229 --> 04:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
people who are newer here and I just
 
04:24:35.429 --> 04:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure they know why we're
 
04:24:36.750 --> 04:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
discussing that's that's an important
 
04:24:37.870 --> 04:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
thing the reason why we now have
 
04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
property estimates and historically the
 
04:24:41.469 --> 04:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
LBA has not done property forecasting in
 
04:24:42.750 --> 04:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
the formula and the Department of
 
04:24:44.710 --> 04:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
Education is because of the significance
 
04:24:46.189 --> 04:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
of the extraordinary needs Grant the
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant is a function
 
04:24:49.830 --> 04:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
of free and reduced price meal counts
 
04:24:52.229 --> 04:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
and property data and so if Property
 
04:24:55.630 --> 04:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
Data uh property valuations if they grow
 
04:24:56.790 --> 04:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
faster than
 
04:24:59.229 --> 04:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
2.2% the adequacy formula is going to be
 
04:25:01.070 --> 04:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
cheaper in the future because property
 
04:25:04.510 --> 04:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
values are growing at a high rate um if
 
04:25:06.990 --> 04:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
the property values were to tank the
 
04:25:09.070 --> 04:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula would go up uh uh I
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
can't put a number for it but you could
 
04:25:13.309 --> 04:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
make an estimate and you could forecast
 
04:25:16.590 --> 04:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
where it would be this is um you all
 
04:25:17.630 --> 04:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
might have opinions about the current
 
04:25:20.550 --> 04:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
property Market um this is looking back
 
04:25:25.109 --> 04:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
a year so this is old data uh moving
 
04:25:27.309 --> 04:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
forward if properties are flat um it
 
04:25:28.870 --> 04:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
could cost the state more an adequacy
 
04:25:30.189 --> 04:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
formula through the extraordinary needs
 
04:25:33.109 --> 04:25:33.119 align:start position:0%
Grant um the other variable um would be
 
04:25:35.469 --> 04:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price meals so in this
 
04:25:38.349 --> 04:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
estimate for fiscal year 27 we assume no
 
04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
drop in poverty um so basically we we we
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
assume uh a drop in enrollment but
 
04:25:48.229 --> 04:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
potentially poverty is going to stay the
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
same um and so we've kind of seen just
 
04:25:53.389 --> 04:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
like we've seen Special Education data
 
04:25:55.710 --> 04:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
um we've seen those numbers not really
 
04:25:57.750 --> 04:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
drop so there's a higher percentage of
 
04:26:00.030 --> 04:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
individuals was uh in special education
 
04:26:02.269 --> 04:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
programs um as a percent of the student
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
population so we held those numbers
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
constant in our estimate we held poverty
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
constant in our estiment we increased
 
04:26:12.269 --> 04:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
property values um and we declined to
 
04:26:13.950 --> 04:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
moment a little bit so those are all the
 
04:26:15.189 --> 04:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
assumptions that would go into that
 
04:26:17.990 --> 04:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
formula we think that's a fair number we
 
04:26:20.670 --> 04:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
don't know this number could be off by 5
 
04:26:22.750 --> 04:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
million 10 million we don't know but we
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
think based on those assumptions um I
 
04:26:26.309 --> 04:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
think we're happy with that and you
 
04:26:29.070 --> 04:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
funding at this num this number um keep
 
04:26:30.590 --> 04:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
in mind if something happens like
 
04:26:33.389 --> 04:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
poverty skyrockets um adequacy would
 
04:26:34.830 --> 04:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
become more expensive and you would have
 
04:26:36.189 --> 04:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
to we would have to draw a warrant to
 
04:26:39.469 --> 04:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
pay for it um so this is the challenge
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
you have as far as forecasting the
 
04:26:42.670 --> 04:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
future we think these this is a fine
 
04:26:44.990 --> 04:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
number for you to put there in your
 
04:26:47.309 --> 04:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
budget for a little bit of context if I
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
could add to that Mark was talking about
 
04:26:52.389 --> 04:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
warrants earlier so last bium in 2023 we
 
04:26:55.790 --> 04:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
assumed we budgeted 1 b53 million for
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 adequacy if you look at the
 
04:27:01.070 --> 04:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
one pag or Mark just gave in ad in
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 for adequacy it's 1 billi 64
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
million so it was $1 million off that
 
04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
the department had to draw warrant so 1%
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
which is really not not that bad
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
considering you know 11 million seems
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
like a large warrant to have to draw but
 
04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
on over a billion dollars it's not too
 
04:27:19.590 --> 04:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
bad one of one of the yeah the the
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
percentages make us look good but 10
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
million is not I don't want to be off by
 
04:27:25.910 --> 04:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
10 million again um and one of the
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
reasons why we were off was we had a
 
04:27:30.510 --> 04:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
hard time forecasting poverty so f&amp;r
 
04:27:33.590 --> 04:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
data um the districts give us a
 
04:27:34.830 --> 04:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year count of the
 
04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
students they think are going to be free
 
04:27:38.349 --> 04:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
and reduce price meals and we just sort
 
04:27:40.990 --> 04:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
of use that data but through as the year
 
04:27:43.030 --> 04:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
progress more students started accessing
 
04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
fnr programs so poverty did increase
 
04:27:46.590 --> 04:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
from what we thought it was going to be
 
04:27:48.429 --> 04:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
when we did our first snapshot of data
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
collection and so it grew and that
 
04:27:52.750 --> 04:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
caused the budget to be off by just the
 
04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
nature of the extraordinary needs Grant
 
04:27:56.070 --> 04:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
off by a lot that's why we're not
 
04:27:58.349 --> 04:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
forecasting any drop in poverty so in
 
04:28:00.950 --> 04:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
that way we're being conservative um of
 
04:28:02.830 --> 04:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
course anything can happen to the data
 
04:28:04.590 --> 04:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
um but that's where we're trying to
 
04:28:06.429 --> 04:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
maybe correct not trying to overcorrect
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
but trying to correct for maybe that
 
04:28:11.750 --> 04:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
mistake um or that that blip uh uh issue
 
04:28:11.760 --> 04:28:13.269 align:start position:0%
mistake um or that that blip uh uh issue
before

04:28:13.269 --> 04:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:28:16.309 --> 04:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
um so that's our adequacy estimates uh
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
um that the um and this is the backup um
 
04:28:20.750 --> 04:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
um and Mickey always talks with us
 
04:28:23.070 --> 04:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
whenever he's building his adequacy town
 
04:28:24.670 --> 04:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
by town or building estimates or working
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
with the committee to build your own
 
04:28:29.510 --> 04:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
estimates um um we'll we'll always uh
 
04:28:31.670 --> 04:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
quality control each other's work
 
04:28:39.109 --> 04:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:42.510 --> 04:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
adequacy um yes we're good
 
04:28:45.990 --> 04:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
the the next document really um again I
 
04:28:46.990 --> 04:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
know you have no more questions about
 
04:28:51.309 --> 04:28:51.319 align:start position:0%
District adequacy but page six um this
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
will just confirm everything that you
 
04:28:54.910 --> 04:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
that you've already just heard you'll
 
04:28:57.550 --> 04:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
notice we plugged in our our 1.2%
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
decline in
 
04:29:02.030 --> 04:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
ADM uh page six of the district adequacy
 
04:29:05.510 --> 04:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
one should look like this um again you
 
04:29:06.990 --> 04:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
can see the you can see the numbers
 
04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
yourself uh fnr numbers we have holding
 
04:29:11.349 --> 04:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
steady special education numbers we have
 
04:29:17.389 --> 04:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:19.710 --> 04:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
decline so that's it for district
 
04:29:22.389 --> 04:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
adequacy any
 
04:29:24.990 --> 04:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
questions um and and what the governor
 
04:29:28.109 --> 04:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
has proposed is exactly this and so um
 
04:29:30.189 --> 04:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
no uh if you agree with these
 
04:29:31.950 --> 04:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
assumptions in this estimate um you
 
04:29:34.910 --> 04:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
would have to make no changes um however
 
04:29:37.550 --> 04:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
of course um this Ed funding has been
 
04:29:39.269 --> 04:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
looking at changes to adequacy and so
 
04:29:47.670 --> 04:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:01.309 --> 04:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:03.349 --> 04:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
Schools yeah we'll move on to Charter
 
04:30:05.710 --> 04:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
Schools but just to go back to this
 
04:30:07.630 --> 04:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
handout if we're going to enumerate all
 
04:30:09.349 --> 04:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
the programs that potentially have a
 
04:30:11.710 --> 04:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
financial uh uh cost to the state that
 
04:30:14.670 --> 04:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
is unknown um there's District adequacy
 
04:30:16.870 --> 04:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
which if we estimate is accurate then
 
04:30:18.070 --> 04:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
then you're then the cost is the
 
04:30:19.469 --> 04:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
estimate if then then you don't have any
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
unknown cost um there's Charter School
 
04:30:25.269 --> 04:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
tuition um which has an EFA uh um uh has
 
04:30:27.950 --> 04:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
a a a warrant Authority education
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts um EFA phase out grants
 
04:30:32.030 --> 04:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
which we'll talk about have warrant
 
04:30:33.710 --> 04:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
Authority um down here towards the
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
bottom is kindergarten enrollment um So
 
04:30:38.109 --> 04:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
currently a few districts are having
 
04:30:40.030 --> 04:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
town meeting district meeting to
 
04:30:42.109 --> 04:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
determine if they want to go from a half
 
04:30:44.149 --> 04:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
funded kindergarten program to a full
 
04:30:46.229 --> 04:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
day funded kindergarten program and
 
04:30:48.750 --> 04:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
under state law if they go from full day
 
04:30:53.550 --> 04:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
to so from half day to full day um uh we
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
have to increase their adequacy amount
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
um to cover that half day Delta because
 
04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
when you think about adequacy adequacy
 
04:31:03.149 --> 04:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
is one year behind so basically they
 
04:31:04.830 --> 04:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
have to wait a full year to be paid for
 
04:31:08.910 --> 04:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
1.0 ADM and so we fund them at half um
 
04:31:10.870 --> 04:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
the missing half of an ADM that they
 
04:31:12.510 --> 04:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
need and it's considered like a startup
 
04:31:14.469 --> 04:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
Grant so it basically catches adequacy
 
04:31:18.750 --> 04:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
up with real time um so there's four
 
04:31:21.790 --> 04:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
districts considering it um if they go
 
04:31:23.469 --> 04:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
ahead and pass it and have full day
 
04:31:25.830 --> 04:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
kindergarten we are going to have to uh
 
04:31:28.630 --> 04:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh Implement uh uh payout
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
kindergarten startup grants um we're
 
04:31:33.429 --> 04:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
going to know more by the end of uh
 
04:31:35.990 --> 04:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow uh so we'll pass that
 
04:31:37.550 --> 04:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
information along to the LBA so you'll
 
04:31:39.630 --> 04:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
have that information which um which
 
04:31:41.030 --> 04:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
Mickey would plug into the Surplus
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
statement because that also as warrant
 
04:31:44.750 --> 04:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
Authority um and so that's will just be
 
04:31:47.229 --> 04:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
a potential variable in your budgeting
 
04:31:50.550 --> 04:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
um the other one is SAU merger grants if
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
any SAU uh
 
04:31:56.469 --> 04:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
consolidates and uh um with another SAU
 
04:31:58.710 --> 04:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
there's $200 per student that goes out
 
04:32:01.870 --> 04:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
in a grant currently um we have received
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
no applications as far as districts
 
04:32:05.950 --> 04:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
looking to merge or saus looking to
 
04:32:08.309 --> 04:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
merge with each other um but if they did
 
04:32:10.149 --> 04:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
that would be a cost to the state for
 
04:32:13.469 --> 04:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
$200 a student um so the numbers here
 
04:32:16.469 --> 04:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
are zero because we don't have any
 
04:32:16.479 --> 04:32:17.990 align:start position:0%
are zero because we don't have any
information

04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:32:20.710 --> 04:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
wer why wouldn't it be a savings when
 
04:32:22.910 --> 04:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
they merge so there there could be a
 
04:32:26.469 --> 04:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
saving locally but to the state uh uh
 
04:32:28.349 --> 04:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
the state the way the grant is the way
 
04:32:29.950 --> 04:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
the bill was written and then enacted
 
04:32:32.349 --> 04:32:32.359 align:start position:0%
into law was it's an SAU merger Grant so
 
04:32:34.950 --> 04:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
it incentivizes them to merge sius and
 
04:32:38.070 --> 04:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
it cost $200 a student okay what what
 
04:32:40.030 --> 04:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
page are you on uh this is just the just
 
04:32:43.109 --> 04:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
at the bottom here uh the same one yeah
 
04:32:44.950 --> 04:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
at the the last last little row there
 
04:32:48.389 --> 04:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
SAU merger we have zeros in
 
04:32:51.269 --> 04:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
there there
 
04:32:51.279 --> 04:32:54.510 align:start position:0%
there there
the

04:32:54.510 --> 04:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:58.510 --> 04:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
yep papich thank you um while I know
 
04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
this would be terrible policy I swear to
 
04:33:02.469 --> 04:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
God sometimes I'm tempted to charge a
 
04:33:04.830 --> 04:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
fee to people who split Asus for the
 
04:33:08.629 --> 04:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
exact same reason I understand that uh
 
04:33:10.269 --> 04:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
it's not legislation I'm planning to
 
04:33:12.990 --> 04:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
propose but given how much duplication
 
04:33:15.390 --> 04:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
in Services usually results from SAU
 
04:33:18.510 --> 04:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
splitting you know it's what it is it
 
04:33:20.269 --> 04:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
was discussed during the um when the seu
 
04:33:21.349 --> 04:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
merger bill was going through the
 
04:33:24.510 --> 04:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
process um I've seus haven't really
 
04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
Consolidated since like the 1960s so
 
04:33:31.310 --> 04:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.150 --> 04:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
up um the other thing to point out um
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
and this is one of the challenges we
 
04:33:37.150 --> 04:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
have so this adequacy number we're
 
04:33:38.990 --> 04:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
pretty comfortable with because adequacy
 
04:33:41.230 --> 04:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
uses data from one year behind where it
 
04:33:43.269 --> 04:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
gets a little more challenging for the
 
04:33:44.990 --> 04:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
the department and for all of you is
 
04:33:46.629 --> 04:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
forecasting the programs that use
 
04:33:49.390 --> 04:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
current data so charter school adequacy
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
we pay in real time this year in which
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
the student was educ educated we provide
 
04:33:57.429 --> 04:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
the uh Charter School Grant um same with
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts so it's
 
04:34:01.869 --> 04:34:01.879 align:start position:0%
that's all happening in real time so the
 
04:34:04.029 --> 04:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
reasons why we have updated numbers for
 
04:34:06.670 --> 04:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
you for Charter School uh funding and
 
04:34:08.990 --> 04:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
EFA funding is because the data is
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
coming in real time so we're getting
 
04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
continuous data collection points and
 
04:34:15.029 --> 04:34:15.039 align:start position:0%
then it's helping us uh forecast our
 
04:34:16.830 --> 04:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
estimates to be more accurate about the
 
04:34:18.269 --> 04:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
current year in which we're educating
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
the child and paying for their education
 
04:34:23.551 --> 04:34:23.561 align:start position:0%
and then also future fiscal years so
 
04:34:26.230 --> 04:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
um uh we have a couple different
 
04:34:28.990 --> 04:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
estimates relative to charter school
 
04:34:30.990 --> 04:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
funding so so specifically to what Mark
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
is just talking about so for Charter
 
04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
Schools we had a payment that we just
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
made on March 1st to all of the charter
 
04:34:37.510 --> 04:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
schools so this data is super Super
 
04:34:38.830 --> 04:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
Fresh you're some of the first people
 
04:34:40.390 --> 04:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
that are seeing this information because
 
04:34:42.310 --> 04:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
this is a based on a very recent count
 
04:34:44.429 --> 04:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
and when we get into the efas same sort
 
04:34:46.390 --> 04:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
of thing they actually have a payment on
 
04:34:48.629 --> 04:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
April 1st but they count on March 1st so
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
they are in the process of counting we
 
04:34:51.869 --> 04:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
have that count prelimary information in
 
04:34:53.310 --> 04:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
this packet but it wasn't available to
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
other people when they were working on
 
04:34:56.429 --> 04:34:56.439 align:start position:0%
the budget so when you're looking at
 
04:34:57.789 --> 04:34:57.799 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools and you look at your
 
04:35:00.551 --> 04:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
packet um so what we have in here is so
 
04:35:02.590 --> 04:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
we have new Charter we've kind of broken
 
04:35:04.470 --> 04:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
it down to existing charter schools so
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
those are the charter schools that are
 
04:35:07.070 --> 04:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
there that their doors are open that
 
04:35:08.949 --> 04:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
there's kids in there right now in this
 
04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
school year and then we have new and
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
pending charters schools which mean
 
04:35:14.310 --> 04:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
these schools haven't opened yet some of
 
04:35:15.670 --> 04:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
them have been approved by the State
 
04:35:17.429 --> 04:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
Board of Education some of them haven't
 
04:35:19.070 --> 04:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
been we're kind of in the process of
 
04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
getting them approved and through that
 
04:35:24.109 --> 04:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
process and there could be some costs um
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
or there will be some costs associated
 
04:35:27.949 --> 04:35:27.959 align:start position:0%
with those schools and we've really
 
04:35:29.629 --> 04:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
thought it was important to break down
 
04:35:31.949 --> 04:35:31.959 align:start position:0%
that bucket because the existing schools
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's you know their enrollment number is
 
04:35:36.510 --> 04:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
probably a much more predictable number
 
04:35:38.390 --> 04:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
most of the schools are open they have
 
04:35:40.789 --> 04:35:40.799 align:start position:0%
kids there the new schools the numbers
 
04:35:42.269 --> 04:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
that we've used are based on their
 
04:35:44.429 --> 04:35:44.439 align:start position:0%
applications and their Charters but some
 
04:35:46.269 --> 04:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
of those are maybe more optimistic
 
04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
numbers than what have you know they
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
might actually end up opening at and
 
04:35:51.070 --> 04:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
that's been a historical issue that we
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
struggled with with Charter Schools so
 
04:35:54.189 --> 04:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
on the first page well it's actually
 
04:35:55.709 --> 04:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
page two of your packet that's exactly
 
04:35:56.750 --> 04:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
what we have we have the breakdown
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
between existing and new and pending
 
04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
charter schools so the pending means
 
04:36:03.070 --> 04:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
just to remind everybody the pending
 
04:36:06.670 --> 04:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
means we have an application um in place
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
or or we've received an application um
 
04:36:10.510 --> 04:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
and we're in the process of working
 
04:36:12.029 --> 04:36:12.039 align:start position:0%
through the approval process of that to
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
the State Board of
 
04:36:16.830 --> 04:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
Education um so if you look on page
 
04:36:20.109 --> 04:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
three of your packet um we have the
 
04:36:22.109 --> 04:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
charter schools the existing Charter
 
04:36:24.590 --> 04:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
Schools um we have the 25 count which
 
04:36:26.349 --> 04:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
that was the count for the March 1
 
04:36:28.349 --> 04:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
payment that's right there um that's hot
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
off the press um and then we have a 26
 
04:36:35.189 --> 04:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
and a 27 um count that we are estimating
 
04:36:37.349 --> 04:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
based on historical growth of charter
 
04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
schools and then also we reviewed
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools applications were
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
approved by State Board of Education to
 
04:36:45.230 --> 04:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that if we were existing or
 
04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
projecting growth that we didn't exceed
 
04:36:49.551 --> 04:36:49.561 align:start position:0%
a charter schools cap so remember when a
 
04:36:50.869 --> 04:36:50.879 align:start position:0%
charter schools comes to the State Board
 
04:36:53.789 --> 04:36:53.799 align:start position:0%
of Education they propose an a total
 
04:36:55.789 --> 04:36:55.799 align:start position:0%
enrollment um and they
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
appro propose enrollments by grade and
 
04:37:00.590 --> 04:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
then if the charter school wants to have
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
more kids than they had originally
 
04:37:03.109 --> 04:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
approved they actually have to go to the
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education to request uh
 
04:37:07.750 --> 04:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment to their Charter to change
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
their cap so that is being accounted for
 
04:37:12.150 --> 04:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
in this this um spreadsheet that you
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
have here so if you look at it we're
 
04:37:17.429 --> 04:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
projecting an estimated $70 million for
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
charter schools for 26 and then $74
 
04:37:22.349 --> 04:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
million for charter schools for 27 for
 
04:37:24.070 --> 04:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
just the charter schools that are open
 
04:37:27.789 --> 04:37:27.799 align:start position:0%
with kids in their doors as of today um
 
04:37:29.551 --> 04:37:29.561 align:start position:0%
and that includes the virtual Learning
 
04:37:31.349 --> 04:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
Academy which has two different
 
04:37:33.629 --> 04:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
functions so virtual Learning Academy is
 
04:37:36.510 --> 04:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
a virtual charter school that has kids
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
from all around the state that are
 
04:37:39.429 --> 04:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
enrolled in traditional Public Schools
 
04:37:41.109 --> 04:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
accessing courses that are not available
 
04:37:42.629 --> 04:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
at their local school districts at the
 
04:37:44.910 --> 04:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
virtual Learning Academy in addition to
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
kids that are enrolled at the virtual
 
04:37:48.789 --> 04:37:48.799 align:start position:0%
Learning Academy full-time they'll those
 
04:37:51.029 --> 04:37:51.039 align:start position:0%
kids will um graduate from the virtual
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
Learning Academy they can take um and
 
04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
they'll take all of their classes there
 
04:37:58.029 --> 04:37:58.039 align:start position:0%
and whatnot so um so in addition to that
 
04:38:00.349 --> 04:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
the next page on in your packet though
 
04:38:04.269 --> 04:38:04.279 align:start position:0%
this is this is the number that um is
 
04:38:06.029 --> 04:38:06.039 align:start position:0%
quite a large number um and we kind of
 
04:38:07.349 --> 04:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
need to just talk through and make sure
 
04:38:08.830 --> 04:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
that you're all aware of this so these
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
are charter schools that we are
 
04:38:12.869 --> 04:38:12.879 align:start position:0%
projecting will open in the next bym
 
04:38:14.789 --> 04:38:14.799 align:start position:0%
budget so the first group of them you
 
04:38:16.230 --> 04:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
can see it's approved that means they
 
04:38:17.709 --> 04:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
have they've applied to the State Board
 
04:38:19.269 --> 04:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
of Education the State Board of
 
04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
Education has approved their application
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
and they are in various stages of
 
04:38:25.349 --> 04:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
opening so some of them may be opening
 
04:38:27.269 --> 04:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
in 26 actually looks like all of the
 
04:38:28.590 --> 04:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
approv schools that we have here plann
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
to open in 26 and they'll probably have
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
kids for 26 and 27 school year and then
 
04:38:36.670 --> 04:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
we have another group those are the
 
04:38:38.429 --> 04:38:38.439 align:start position:0%
pending groups those are applications
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
that we have in various stages of the
 
04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
application process so some of them
 
04:38:44.670 --> 04:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
might be going to the State Board
 
04:38:46.189 --> 04:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
Thursday of this week I'm not sure if we
 
04:38:48.949 --> 04:38:48.959 align:start position:0%
have one but um to get approved some of
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
them may be throughout the summer or
 
04:38:52.510 --> 04:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of the next year
 
04:38:53.750 --> 04:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
but those are the schools that we know
 
04:38:55.310 --> 04:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
about they've submitted some sort of
 
04:38:56.629 --> 04:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
application there's someplace in the
 
04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
middle of the process um and we
 
04:39:00.349 --> 04:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate those schools opening during
 
04:39:02.310 --> 04:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
the bium but so you can see that the
 
04:39:04.230 --> 04:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
cost we're projecting relative to these
 
04:39:07.150 --> 04:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
schools is between 5 and $10 million for
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
the two years of the bium um and that's
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
a number that we need to talk about and
 
04:39:12.910 --> 04:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
kind of see what where are we
 
04:39:14.910 --> 04:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable budgeting because it's not
 
04:39:17.470 --> 04:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
necessar all of these schools may open
 
04:39:18.990 --> 04:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
and it's not NE they're not necessarily
 
04:39:21.390 --> 04:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
guaranteed to have this number of kids
 
04:39:23.150 --> 04:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
on the flip side of though some of these
 
04:39:25.670 --> 04:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
schools could open with more kids than
 
04:39:27.789 --> 04:39:27.799 align:start position:0%
originally projected so it did really
 
04:39:29.510 --> 04:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
kind of the enrollment on them is a lot
 
04:39:32.070 --> 04:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
harder to predict because they're not
 
04:39:35.150 --> 04:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
accepting kids right now do we have any
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
way to
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
say schools can open um you do as the
 
04:39:42.070 --> 04:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
legislature we don't as the Department
 
04:39:44.910 --> 04:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
of Education actually um it's been kind
 
04:39:46.868 --> 04:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
of it's been put in law that the State
 
04:39:49.230 --> 04:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
Board of Education cannot deny Charter
 
04:39:51.150 --> 04:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
School applications based on finances
 
04:39:54.670 --> 04:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
alone so you would need um other um you
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
would need to write that into hb2 if you
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
wanted that expectation of the
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
department and try to basically set a
 
04:40:03.310 --> 04:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
cap so that we didn't exceed a
 
04:40:06.628 --> 04:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
certain uh budgeted amount and one of
 
04:40:08.270 --> 04:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
the reasons why they're continuing to
 
04:40:10.990 --> 04:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
open um is because we do have a pretty
 
04:40:12.708 --> 04:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
large Charter School startup Grant so
 
04:40:15.270 --> 04:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education in 2019
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
applied and was successful for a $46
 
04:40:19.708 --> 04:40:19.718 align:start position:0%
million Grant to open charter schools
 
04:40:22.590 --> 04:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
and those Grant dollars are used for
 
04:40:24.910 --> 04:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
preliminary um costs associated with
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
opening a charter school prior to their
 
04:40:29.628 --> 04:40:29.638 align:start position:0%
opening um and so um we actually on the
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
last page of your packet I have um kind
 
04:40:33.788 --> 04:40:33.798 align:start position:0%
of the status of that Grant but we have
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
opened a fair number of Charter School
 
04:40:37.590 --> 04:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
Grants with or charter schools with that
 
04:40:41.390 --> 04:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
Grant um so the the three primary um use
 
04:40:42.750 --> 04:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
of that Grant is to open a new Charter
 
04:40:44.910 --> 04:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
School expand an existing charter school
 
04:40:47.230 --> 04:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
or replicate an existing Charter School
 
04:40:48.990 --> 04:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
um we've had some we had some initial
 
04:40:50.550 --> 04:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
delays on that Grant because of some
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
legislative decisions and then the grant
 
04:40:54.990 --> 04:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
did kind of get off what we think is
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
probably a little slower um than it
 
04:40:59.150 --> 04:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
would have because of the pandemic but
 
04:41:01.708 --> 04:41:01.718 align:start position:0%
now we are in the end years of our grant
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
and we're having a lot of applicants
 
04:41:05.110 --> 04:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
people are very interested in that Grant
 
04:41:07.030 --> 04:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
and and leveraging that
 
04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity repr wer how many years do
 
04:41:11.830 --> 04:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
the 46 Mill
 
04:41:13.750 --> 04:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
um so it was a 5-year Grant initially
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
with the authority to apply for five
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
additional one c um one at a time no
 
04:41:22.510 --> 04:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
cost extensions um we're not sure what
 
04:41:24.190 --> 04:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
that process looks like with the US
 
04:41:25.788 --> 04:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Education currently but
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
right now we are in the first year of
 
04:41:29.030 --> 04:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
our no cost extension so up to four
 
04:41:32.030 --> 04:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
additional years are those extensions of
 
04:41:34.550 --> 04:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
the existing monies yes the existing use
 
04:41:36.830 --> 04:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
them over an extended period of time yes
 
04:41:40.830 --> 04:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative Murray thank you go
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
ahead oh I was going to say just the
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
rest of information that's in your
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
packet or do you w
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
to um so on the governor's budget in 26
 
04:41:53.590 --> 04:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
and 27 you're looking at 66 million 68
 
04:41:55.628 --> 04:41:55.638 align:start position:0%
million you're saying that you need
 
04:41:58.910 --> 04:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
between 70 and 74 million yes and you
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
need an additional
 
04:42:04.190 --> 04:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
55 million uh for the charter school
 
04:42:06.190 --> 04:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
program potentially yes so we've got a
 
04:42:09.510 --> 04:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
gap of around $22 million yes and that's
 
04:42:11.310 --> 04:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
because the the governor's budget was
 
04:42:12.788 --> 04:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
based on the agency phase of the budget
 
04:42:14.550 --> 04:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
which we had prepared if you remember a
 
04:42:16.150 --> 04:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
year ago before there were any schools
 
04:42:17.670 --> 04:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
open and so when we've done the counts
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
throughout the year the number has
 
04:42:20.830 --> 04:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
substantially increased and then we've
 
04:42:23.550 --> 04:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
also received a lot of applications this
 
04:42:25.110 --> 04:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
year there's there's been a lot of
 
04:42:27.430 --> 04:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
momentum um to open no new Charter
 
04:42:28.590 --> 04:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
Schools this
 
04:42:31.590 --> 04:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
year I'll just add um so yeah page two
 
04:42:33.868 --> 04:42:33.878 align:start position:0%
has the the existing Charter funding and
 
04:42:35.670 --> 04:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
the new and pending Charter funding and
 
04:42:37.510 --> 04:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
so those would be the numbers that if if
 
04:42:39.110 --> 04:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
you accept these numbers they would get
 
04:42:40.430 --> 04:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
plugged into the Surplus statement or
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
hb1 and the Surplus statement as far as
 
04:42:44.670 --> 04:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
how you're funding Charters um just one
 
04:42:46.230 --> 04:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
thing to add because uh Kaylin and I
 
04:42:48.190 --> 04:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
were wrestling with what is a good
 
04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
methodology there's things that our
 
04:42:51.708 --> 04:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
methodology doesn't include it doesn't
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
include any charter schools closing down
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
that does happen we do have a charter
 
04:42:57.708 --> 04:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
school close about once a year typically
 
04:42:58.990 --> 04:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
when a charter school closed down it's
 
04:43:00.670 --> 04:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
usually a slow death where their
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
enrollment declines enrollment declines
 
04:43:04.270 --> 04:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
and they hang on for as long as they can
 
04:43:05.230 --> 04:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
because they want to educate those
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
students um and then they eventually
 
04:43:08.430 --> 04:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
close down um there are sometimes
 
04:43:10.190 --> 04:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
dramatic closures where multiple
 
04:43:12.030 --> 04:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
students now have to leave the Charter
 
04:43:14.350 --> 04:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
system and go to a new Charter system or
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
find a new educational pathway um but
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
but we don't forecast any charter
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
schools closing that could happen which
 
04:43:22.750 --> 04:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
would save the state uh uh money as far
 
04:43:25.470 --> 04:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
as this line item um the other thing we
 
04:43:28.948 --> 04:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
don't include is uh uh these pending
 
04:43:31.030 --> 04:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools we gave them a reduction
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
in what they estimate they'll forecast
 
04:43:34.628 --> 04:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
so a lot of them are very ambitious they
 
04:43:35.990 --> 04:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
want to get as many students as they can
 
04:43:37.030 --> 04:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
into their new charter school they're
 
04:43:41.550 --> 04:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
very excited to open um some of them uh
 
04:43:42.990 --> 04:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh open and they don't have those
 
04:43:44.868 --> 04:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
numbers that they hoped and dreamed for
 
04:43:46.470 --> 04:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
um so we did give them a reduction in
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
that in our estimate um some of them
 
04:43:50.110 --> 04:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
might not just be able to open they
 
04:43:51.470 --> 04:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
really would like to open but they don't
 
04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
open so that's areas where this could
 
04:43:56.868 --> 04:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
be uh overestimating what charter
 
04:43:58.350 --> 04:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
schools are going to be as far as
 
04:44:00.550 --> 04:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
funding is concerned but regardless if
 
04:44:02.390 --> 04:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
this scenario is true and charter
 
04:44:04.110 --> 04:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
schools are able to open they're able to
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
have pretty good enrollments um
 
04:44:07.948 --> 04:44:07.958 align:start position:0%
enrollment Trends hold this would be
 
04:44:09.750 --> 04:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
again back to the education trust fund
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
warrant aspect of it this is what we
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
would have to pay so um there's there's
 
04:44:16.590 --> 04:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
this methodology is not perfect there's
 
04:44:17.948 --> 04:44:17.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of assumptions that go in here a
 
04:44:19.670 --> 04:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
lot of this could happen couldn't happen
 
04:44:21.230 --> 04:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
we think these are fair numbers that you
 
04:44:23.788 --> 04:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
should plug into hb1 um given all the
 
04:44:25.628 --> 04:44:25.638 align:start position:0%
data and assumptions included in this
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
model um but it might it might come out
 
04:44:29.470 --> 04:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
cheaper might come out more expensive
 
04:44:35.230 --> 04:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:39.550 --> 04:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
cheaper repres d as charter schools are
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
increasing public schoool should be
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
decreasing so is there an offset how
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
that that's a good point uh so we we we
 
04:44:48.910 --> 04:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
just include for our district adequacy
 
04:44:50.910 --> 04:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
uh we just have the standard 1.2%
 
04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
enrollment decline um which would that's
 
04:44:55.788 --> 04:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
a historical Trend with Charter Schools
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
online so uh uh yeah potentially that
 
04:45:02.070 --> 04:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
1.2 could be light so it could be there
 
04:45:03.510 --> 04:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
could be higher District enrollment
 
04:45:05.310 --> 04:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
decline um that's assuming students are
 
04:45:06.430 --> 04:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
going from the district system to the
 
04:45:08.670 --> 04:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
Charter system um of course as you'll
 
04:45:10.310 --> 04:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
see in a lot of the LBA fiscal notes
 
04:45:11.550 --> 04:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
students could go from the home
 
04:45:13.750 --> 04:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
education system to a Charter system or
 
04:45:15.948 --> 04:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
the EFA system to the Charter system so
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
h a lot of different ways that's a
 
04:45:19.030 --> 04:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
variable we haven't factored in but
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
that's a good observation also remember
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a Ono one so there's base
 
04:45:24.430 --> 04:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
adequacy that charter schools get but
 
04:45:26.788 --> 04:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
and District Public Schools get District
 
04:45:27.830 --> 04:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
Public Schools do not get an
 
04:45:29.470 --> 04:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grants but all
 
04:45:30.788 --> 04:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
charter school kids receive an
 
04:45:33.070 --> 04:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
additional Charter School Grant of it's
 
04:45:35.550 --> 04:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
about $5,000 per kid for this coming
 
04:45:38.670 --> 04:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
bium so it it's not necessarily A Ono
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
one um there could be more costs
 
04:45:42.110 --> 04:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
associated with the kid going to a
 
04:45:44.070 --> 04:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
charter school or less depending on
 
04:45:45.948 --> 04:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
which district they come from but but
 
04:45:47.750 --> 04:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
the point is that sorry just to the
 
04:45:49.230 --> 04:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
complexity of the variable you're saying
 
04:45:51.070 --> 04:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
is absolutely true but we've not
 
04:45:52.310 --> 04:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
considered that in any model and we
 
04:45:54.270 --> 04:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really know how to do that uh
 
04:45:56.830 --> 04:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh right now right now thank you thank
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
you uh chairman wer thank
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
you when you look at the um grades from
 
04:46:07.390 --> 04:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through 12 isn't there a
 
04:46:10.750 --> 04:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
decline from one grade to another in so
 
04:46:12.550 --> 04:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
the that the population of children is
 
04:46:16.510 --> 04:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
really decreasing yes so and and we're
 
04:46:18.110 --> 04:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
really paying about
 
04:46:21.150 --> 04:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
$10,000 total per Char a student how
 
04:46:23.150 --> 04:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
much of that money is coming from the
 
04:46:23.160 --> 04:46:24.550 align:start position:0%
much of that money is coming from the
school

04:46:24.550 --> 04:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
itself um just some rough numbers um
 
04:46:30.510 --> 04:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
just to confirm uh yeah we see we see uh
 
04:46:32.830 --> 04:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh student enrollment declining overall
 
04:46:34.670 --> 04:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
we see that Trend um there could be
 
04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
bumps and fluctuations but generally
 
04:46:37.150 --> 04:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
that's the trend and that's why we
 
04:46:38.548 --> 04:46:38.558 align:start position:0%
forecast declining enrollment at least
 
04:46:40.150 --> 04:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
in district schools where most students
 
04:46:46.708 --> 04:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
are um uh the um uh the $110,000 number
 
04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
so Charter Schools run their they run
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
their nonprofit the Quasi nonprofit non
 
04:46:54.670 --> 04:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
uh public school um it cost them about
 
04:46:57.350 --> 04:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
$10,000 generally about 85% of it is
 
04:47:00.270 --> 04:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
state funded so um um so the numbers
 
04:47:01.670 --> 04:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
around the cost per people of a charter
 
04:47:03.628 --> 04:47:03.638 align:start position:0%
school yeah because some of it's free
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
and reduced etc etc uh donations so
 
04:47:09.350 --> 04:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
donations um they reimburse locally
 
04:47:12.150 --> 04:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes you said the state divides 85%
 
04:47:14.110 --> 04:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
so even though we're given like 5,000
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
something per per student that's the
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
base Cost Plus free and reduce plus
 
04:47:22.628 --> 04:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
special we're actually giving $9,000 for
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
every charter school kid plus plus the
 
04:47:26.990 --> 04:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and everything like
 
04:47:27.000 --> 04:47:29.750 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and everything like
thank

04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
yes oh yeah you're right you're right
 
04:47:32.708 --> 04:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
the differential Aid would be on top of
 
04:47:34.868 --> 04:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
that would make up some of that uh uh uh
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
represent muray thank you uh so you
 
04:47:45.628 --> 04:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
saiding the state pays 85% of the
 
04:47:48.750 --> 04:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
tuition for the charter schools how much
 
04:47:50.590 --> 04:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
parameters and how much do you how much
 
04:47:55.190 --> 04:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
does That Vary around charter schools in
 
04:47:56.590 --> 04:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
terms of where they're raising their own
 
04:47:59.910 --> 04:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
monies varies a lot um there because
 
04:48:01.110 --> 04:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
because there's several charter schools
 
04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
that have relationships with school
 
04:48:04.110 --> 04:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
districts so school districts are
 
04:48:05.788 --> 04:48:05.798 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the charter schools so we
 
04:48:06.910 --> 04:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
have a charter we have some charter
 
04:48:08.350 --> 04:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
schools in the state that their average
 
04:48:11.110 --> 04:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
cost for pupil is around $30,000 per kid
 
04:48:12.310 --> 04:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
and most of that is tuition dollars
 
04:48:13.590 --> 04:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
you're receiving from a local school
 
04:48:15.310 --> 04:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
district and then we have other charter
 
04:48:17.350 --> 04:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
schools that their amount that they're
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
receiving is right or spending per stent
 
04:48:21.948 --> 04:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
is right around that per pupil $9,000
 
04:48:24.190 --> 04:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
$110,000 amount because they're
 
04:48:25.750 --> 04:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
receiving this and then some federal
 
04:48:27.150 --> 04:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
funds from the Department of Education
 
04:48:28.628 --> 04:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
the title grants that we spoke about
 
04:48:30.590 --> 04:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
before those go to Charter Schools but
 
04:48:32.270 --> 04:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
other than that they're not necessarily
 
04:48:34.750 --> 04:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of local fundraising and and
 
04:48:35.670 --> 04:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
charter schools are different too when
 
04:48:36.788 --> 04:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
you're looking at their financial some
 
04:48:40.110 --> 04:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
of them um are able to bring in Surplus
 
04:48:42.628 --> 04:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
so they're they're having years where
 
04:48:43.990 --> 04:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
they have more money coming in than
 
04:48:45.750 --> 04:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures going out and so then
 
04:48:46.990 --> 04:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
eventually at some point they want to
 
04:48:49.548 --> 04:48:49.558 align:start position:0%
spend that Surplus and uh make change
 
04:48:51.590 --> 04:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
operations in some sort of way and so
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
the the numbers can really fluctuate um
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
in different from districts that's sort
 
04:48:59.830 --> 04:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
of a quasi nonprofit um in addition to
 
04:49:01.350 --> 04:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
the some of the grants that they may get
 
04:49:03.110 --> 04:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
from you know beyond the state do they
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
do is there a fundraising arm to some of
 
04:49:07.230 --> 04:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
these Charter Schools most of the
 
04:49:08.788 --> 04:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
charter schools do quite try to do quite
 
04:49:15.310 --> 04:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:15.320 --> 04:49:19.590 align:start position:0%
 
Doan

04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:22.110 --> 04:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
Charters all right last in your pocket
 
04:49:24.070 --> 04:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
for today we have education Freedom
 
04:49:26.430 --> 04:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
accounts so education Freedom accounts
 
04:49:27.788 --> 04:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
we've already done a fair number of
 
04:49:29.510 --> 04:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
presentations in this room about this as
 
04:49:31.070 --> 04:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
far as the way program worked at the
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and then I know
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
that um Kate Beaker was here on Friday
 
04:49:36.310 --> 04:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
and provided a lot of information to the
 
04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
committee so the Department of Education
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
really put some disinformation on there
 
04:49:41.590 --> 04:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
just to show you how um kind of our
 
04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
estimates have worked and kind of what
 
04:49:46.628 --> 04:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
our current projections are so just like
 
04:49:49.788 --> 04:49:49.798 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools um efas had a count on
 
04:49:51.868 --> 04:49:51.878 align:start position:0%
March 1st and so we have the newest
 
04:49:54.510 --> 04:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment information from them so as
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
of March 1st they had
 
04:49:59.070 --> 04:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
5,794 kids at the beginning of the year
 
04:50:00.270 --> 04:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
or actually last summer when the
 
04:50:01.948 --> 04:50:01.958 align:start position:0%
Department of Education was doing its
 
04:50:03.150 --> 04:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
projections we had thought their
 
04:50:05.708 --> 04:50:05.718 align:start position:0%
projection originally would be 5300 kids
 
04:50:08.470 --> 04:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
so they had 500 more kids um than we had
 
04:50:09.788 --> 04:50:09.798 align:start position:0%
originally projected based on their
 
04:50:11.750 --> 04:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
enrollments that they had last summer um
 
04:50:13.830 --> 04:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
so the program continues to grow so
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
we've updated our estimates from our
 
04:50:18.548 --> 04:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
agency vase budget of of the budget um
 
04:50:23.270 --> 04:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
to be uh 34 million for 26 which would
 
04:50:27.350 --> 04:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
give us a enrollment of about 600 more
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
kids of 6,500 and then 7500 for 27 of 41
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
million so those are the costs of the
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
Department's projected under the current
 
04:50:38.590 --> 04:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
law um the information that you have in
 
04:50:40.070 --> 04:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
your packet if we just flip through it
 
04:50:41.708 --> 04:50:41.718 align:start position:0%
real quick cuz most of it's duplicative
 
04:50:43.470 --> 04:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
to information that you have already
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
received um so we have the um way the
 
04:50:47.390 --> 04:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
formula works and I should have
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned too this was also in your
 
04:50:50.510 --> 04:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
Charter School pack packet and me um
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
explaining how the charter school
 
04:50:53.110 --> 04:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
formula works we like to distribute that
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
as many times as possible um we have the
 
04:50:59.788 --> 04:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
EFA enrollment history so um if you
 
04:51:01.150 --> 04:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
remember you saw that for regular
 
04:51:03.030 --> 04:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy in charter schools it's getting
 
04:51:04.830 --> 04:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
smaller and smaller for efas now as
 
04:51:06.750 --> 04:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
we've added more years but you kind of
 
04:51:08.948 --> 04:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
can see how we've increased the base
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
amount in adequacy and how that impacts
 
04:51:13.270 --> 04:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
the EFA program as well as well as
 
04:51:14.670 --> 04:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
charter schools and that goes for all of
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
the differentiate differentiated AIDS um
 
04:51:20.190 --> 04:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
and then oftentimes we get a lot of
 
04:51:22.830 --> 04:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
requests for what the breakdown of um
 
04:51:24.030 --> 04:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
the number of free and reduced launch
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
special education English language
 
04:51:26.910 --> 04:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
learner kids so that's all in that
 
04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
historical documentation and then you
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
can see what are how much we're spending
 
04:51:32.030 --> 04:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
in total for the education Freedom
 
04:51:34.070 --> 04:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
account program um the next thing in
 
04:51:38.030 --> 04:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
your packet is for the March 1 payment
 
04:51:42.190 --> 04:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
um it has the count um in there um and
 
04:51:45.430 --> 04:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
all of the information that we have um
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing in your packet
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
that we just put there just for your
 
04:51:52.270 --> 04:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
informational purposes um is the phase
 
04:51:55.708 --> 04:51:55.718 align:start position:0%
out Grant so um so the phase out Grant
 
04:51:57.628 --> 04:51:57.638 align:start position:0%
is a grant that is paid to District
 
04:51:59.990 --> 04:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
Public Schools when a child leaves an
 
04:52:02.750 --> 04:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
EFA or leaves a public school and takes
 
04:52:05.670 --> 04:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
it an EFA the very first year that the
 
04:52:07.470 --> 04:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
kid leaves its Public School receives
 
04:52:09.990 --> 04:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
100% because adequacy is one year in a
 
04:52:11.470 --> 04:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
the second year year the child's left
 
04:52:13.590 --> 04:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
this Public School receives 50% and the
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
third year this CH the School receives
 
04:52:19.350 --> 04:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
25% for that child um we calculate that
 
04:52:21.628 --> 04:52:21.638 align:start position:0%
through fiscal year 26 and that's the
 
04:52:23.070 --> 04:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
last year that we'll be calculating that
 
04:52:24.910 --> 04:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
and then that Grant goes away so we kind
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
of laid out the cohorts here for you to
 
04:52:29.788 --> 04:52:29.798 align:start position:0%
kind of follow through um because there
 
04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
we've been asking we've been getting a
 
04:52:33.910 --> 04:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
lot of questions relative to how of
 
04:52:35.708 --> 04:52:35.718 align:start position:0%
those cohorts work and when we pay those
 
04:52:38.510 --> 04:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
last cohorts so the last cohort will get
 
04:52:41.390 --> 04:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
or it will be in fiscal year 20 six um
 
04:52:43.270 --> 04:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
but it will be paid through fiscal year
 
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
28 um and that information is there and
 
04:52:48.548 --> 04:52:48.558 align:start position:0%
so the Department's projections for the
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
phase out grants um are about a million
 
04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
$1.2 million for fiscal year 26 and $1.2
 
04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
million for fiscal year
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
27 and when we calculate it in fiscal
 
04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
year 26 that will be the last time we
 
04:53:03.990 --> 04:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
calculate it and so then those budget
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
estimates will be set for 27 and then
 
04:53:08.310 --> 04:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 28 when we work on that
 
04:53:16.708 --> 04:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:18.830 --> 04:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
the pen
 
04:53:22.750 --> 04:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
Phillips so with the governor's proposal
 
04:53:25.430 --> 04:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
for expansion of the for children who
 
04:53:27.470 --> 04:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
are leaving the public school sorry I
 
04:53:30.030 --> 04:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
lost my mic there um for the Governor's
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
proposal for um students for expanding
 
04:53:34.990 --> 04:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
the EFA program for students who leave
 
04:53:36.788 --> 04:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
the public school there would be no
 
04:53:39.230 --> 04:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
phase out grant for them moving forward
 
04:53:48.510 --> 04:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:49.830 --> 04:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
any other
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
questions so just so I'm clearing that
 
04:53:57.150 --> 04:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
final chart there the highlighted in
 
04:53:59.470 --> 04:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
yellow how does it diff distinct from
 
04:54:01.350 --> 04:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
not highlighted at the very end of each
 
04:54:04.510 --> 04:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
row so you've got FY 26 with a yellow
 
04:54:06.310 --> 04:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
highlight then you skip over to the FY
 
04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
26 at the end adequacy harm is that the
 
04:54:12.030 --> 04:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
actual total this is the the yellow is
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be U it's our estimates for
 
04:54:16.390 --> 04:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
phas out for the budget so uh fiscal
 
04:54:20.350 --> 04:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
year 25 is the actual for fiscal year 25
 
04:54:23.430 --> 04:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year 26 is uh uh essentially
 
04:54:25.390 --> 04:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
that methodology is we take the number
 
04:54:28.230 --> 04:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's just basically 39 students uh left
 
04:54:30.990 --> 04:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
the district system for the for an EFA
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
and it red it caused U that fiscal year
 
04:54:36.470 --> 04:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
impact and so we just added 2% to that
 
04:54:38.830 --> 04:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
essentially and so if you follow the EFA
 
04:54:41.910 --> 04:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
formula calculation then gets you to EFA
 
04:54:45.030 --> 04:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
phase out rant of 1.2 million in fiscal
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
year 26 so that's all that is is us just
 
04:54:49.590 --> 04:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
coming up with revised budget estimates
 
04:54:51.030 --> 04:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I I was I thought you're on
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
the next one already you're not there
 
04:54:54.270 --> 04:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
yet you're not there you're not on the
 
04:54:57.230 --> 04:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
next page yet um one that doesn't have a
 
04:55:00.750 --> 04:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
header on it page 12 yes yeah so what's
 
04:55:02.910 --> 04:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
going on between the 1.2 million and the
 
04:55:06.910 --> 04:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
1.6 million oh so uh the the way phase
 
04:55:10.310 --> 04:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
out works is that fiscal year 26 we call
 
04:55:11.868 --> 04:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
call it harm so this is harm when a
 
04:55:14.030 --> 04:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
student leaves a district goes to an
 
04:55:15.910 --> 04:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account that District
 
04:55:17.628 --> 04:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
loses out inadequacy and PHS out needs
 
04:55:20.310 --> 04:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
to pay them so the total amount of harm
 
04:55:22.868 --> 04:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
as measured by that that methodology is
 
04:55:24.750 --> 04:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
1.6 million but we don't pay the
 
04:55:27.430 --> 04:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
district 1.6 million we pay them 50% of
 
04:55:28.990 --> 04:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
that which is the
 
04:55:31.110 --> 04:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
823k in the fiscal year in which the
 
04:55:34.670 --> 04:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
harm was curred and then we pay them 25%
 
04:55:37.390 --> 04:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
of the harm done in FIS year 25 okay so
 
04:55:40.590 --> 04:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh you're basically taking that 823k
 
04:55:44.470 --> 04:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
adding that 43k and you're getting that
 
04:55:46.590 --> 04:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
1. so that's the pH out it's a little
 
04:55:51.190 --> 04:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
tricky that La okay yeah right
 
04:55:54.990 --> 04:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
you and I'm sorry Murray go ahead
 
04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
um so the governor's budget has the
 
04:56:05.670 --> 04:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
750,000 so again uh what doe is saying
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
they need is considerably more than what
 
04:56:09.548 --> 04:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
the governor is projecting she correct
 
04:56:10.910 --> 04:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
correct why
 
04:56:13.230 --> 04:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
so what did the governor use to come up
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
with 750,000 use the agency the agency's
 
04:56:17.868 --> 04:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
projections those are our original
 
04:56:19.230 --> 04:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
projections but because we have new or
 
04:56:20.910 --> 04:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
better data we've been able to update it
 
04:56:20.920 --> 04:56:26.390 align:start position:0%
better data we've been able to update it
since

04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:29.628 --> 04:56:29.638 align:start position:0%
then represent hacken Phillips so um I'm
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
interested in um what the charter I'm
 
04:56:34.590 --> 04:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
sorry the education Freedom
 
04:56:34.600 --> 04:56:36.230 align:start position:0%
sorry the education Freedom
account

04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
account
 
04:56:39.628 --> 04:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
um numbers for 26 and 27 would be if we
 
04:56:41.548 --> 04:56:41.558 align:start position:0%
were to accept the Assumption of the
 
04:56:43.830 --> 04:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
governor's expansion of the program do
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
we have estimates for that so I I
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
believe Kate Baker gave you guys some
 
04:56:49.830 --> 04:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
numbers last week um oh for the the
 
04:56:51.390 --> 04:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
governor's yeah so the governor it is
 
04:56:54.750 --> 04:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
page two of that document so we think uh
 
04:56:58.830 --> 04:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
we think if you implement law 512
 
04:57:03.270 --> 04:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
produced okay the 34.8 million again the
 
04:57:06.390 --> 04:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
program predict EFA program enrollment
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
but that 3.4 Million number SE okay um
 
04:57:12.430 --> 04:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
and then the governor put forward
 
04:57:16.390 --> 04:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
41.1 million 27 and we're not disputing
 
04:57:20.548 --> 04:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
that okay so these assume the one-year
 
04:57:23.548 --> 04:57:23.558 align:start position:0%
public students are migrating yep under
 
04:57:32.070 --> 04:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:35.310 --> 04:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:39.150 --> 04:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
you represent thank you um I thought I
 
04:57:40.708 --> 04:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
had understood
 
04:57:43.548 --> 04:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
um back to that page um the governor has
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
hold on one second what oh go aheading
 
04:57:47.160 --> 04:57:49.510 align:start position:0%
hold on one second what oh go aheading
up

04:57:49.510 --> 04:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
there want make not be I think he's
 
04:57:56.310 --> 04:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:00.230 --> 04:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
clear on the sheet you gave us it's
 
04:58:03.990 --> 04:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
44 oh wait I see 41 what you seeing 44
 
04:58:05.470 --> 04:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
oh all over there yeah so this is this
 
04:58:07.390 --> 04:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
is current law so we did so the
 
04:58:09.708 --> 04:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
governor's governor's office projected
 
04:58:11.708 --> 04:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
um with the additional kids the increase
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:19.830 --> 04:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient our is 41 so 41 sufficient or
 
04:58:22.510 --> 04:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
44 sufficient so so 41 is sufficient
 
04:58:24.830 --> 04:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
based on current law and enrollment if
 
04:58:28.270 --> 04:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
the governor if if if the proposal is to
 
04:58:29.948 --> 04:58:29.958 align:start position:0%
increase the governor's proposal which
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
is um access for all public school kids
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
we believe the 44 is sufficient so the
 
04:58:38.788 --> 04:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
41 is based on current law 44 is based
 
04:58:40.910 --> 04:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
on something that something in law that
 
04:58:42.510 --> 04:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
might change correct and we don't know
 
04:58:43.868 --> 04:58:43.878 align:start position:0%
where that's going to end up right now
 
04:58:49.390 --> 04:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:56.430 --> 04:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
FPL just may yeah go ahead and um I mean
 
04:59:01.948 --> 04:59:01.958 align:start position:0%
there's there are a lot of proposals out
 
04:59:02.830 --> 04:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
there we don't know where they're going
 
04:59:05.190 --> 04:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
to end um part of the governors which I
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
don't think is in a bill is you have to
 
04:59:09.190 --> 04:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
be in this public school for a year
 
04:59:10.990 --> 04:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
before you're eligible
 
04:59:13.310 --> 04:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
um how do you consider those numbers
 
04:59:14.830 --> 04:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
when you're making your estimates of
 
04:59:17.110 --> 04:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
people joining an EFA program but again
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
we don't know if that's so our estimate
 
04:59:21.110 --> 04:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
just we just estimated current year the
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
governor did a proposal and and did
 
04:59:26.310 --> 04:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
their estimate at 44 and we don't have
 
04:59:29.590 --> 04:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:33.590 --> 04:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
that um yeah difficult to estimate um
 
04:59:35.708 --> 04:59:35.718 align:start position:0%
and and so just always keep in mind as
 
04:59:37.110 --> 04:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
far as whatever the number you put in
 
04:59:39.430 --> 04:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
there if the program is more successful
 
04:59:41.230 --> 04:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
than you envisioned it's going to cost
 
04:59:43.948 --> 04:59:43.958 align:start position:0%
more uh money so always just be mindful
 
04:59:43.958 --> 04:59:46.628 align:start position:0%
more uh money so always just be mindful
of

04:59:46.628 --> 04:59:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:50.270 --> 04:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:52.990 --> 04:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
else any other comments from yeah just
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
one thing Mick Mickey and I were talking
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
about and I think he's already U fiscal
 
05:00:01.150 --> 05:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
year 25 Charter Schools um so uh Vicky
 
05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
presented a surplus statement that said
 
05:00:05.750 --> 05:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
the warrant would be $6 million for
 
05:00:08.350 --> 05:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
charter schools in fiscal year 25 and
 
05:00:10.030 --> 05:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
that's on the Surplus statement U Mickey
 
05:00:11.510 --> 05:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
I've been talking about how much money
 
05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
is carried over and so that warrants Pro
 
05:00:15.430 --> 05:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
I'll give Mickey an official more
 
05:00:17.070 --> 05:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
detailed number but essentially instead
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
of a $6 million warrant it's likely
 
05:00:20.670 --> 05:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
going to be more like $3 million so you
 
05:00:22.830 --> 05:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
got a little saving there found found
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
you $3 million did not find you did not
 
05:00:27.390 --> 05:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
find you tens of millions of dollars but
 
05:00:28.990 --> 05:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
um um just but that's just just want to
 
05:00:30.030 --> 05:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
get that on record that Mickey will
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
produce that uh number for you and it's
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
based on our conversations about how
 
05:00:34.750 --> 05:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
much money we think is available that
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to go through the warrant
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
process okay thank you did you have some
 
05:00:40.590 --> 05:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
comments you'd like to so I'll just kind
 
05:00:41.868 --> 05:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
of add on to that talking about the
 
05:00:43.230 --> 05:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement so the one Mark was
 
05:00:44.670 --> 05:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
referring to is the one I provided to
 
05:00:47.350 --> 05:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
everyone on the 19th of February um so
 
05:00:48.788 --> 05:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
that number there we'll we'll adjust
 
05:00:50.750 --> 05:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
that number for 25 our Assumption of how
 
05:00:53.350 --> 05:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
much it's going to be spent uh this year
 
05:00:54.910 --> 05:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh but the department did just present
 
05:00:57.390 --> 05:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
Charter School numbers EFA numbers EFA
 
05:00:59.948 --> 05:00:59.958 align:start position:0%
phase out grant numbers that are very
 
05:01:01.708 --> 05:01:01.718 align:start position:0%
different than what the governor has in
 
05:01:03.750 --> 05:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget so I
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
would like to put a another snapshot
 
05:01:08.390 --> 05:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
together for you but I I will need
 
05:01:09.470 --> 05:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
guidance from the committee and it
 
05:01:11.470 --> 05:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to to be today of what the
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
committee wants to assume for these
 
05:01:14.350 --> 05:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
programs so you've got numbers the
 
05:01:15.830 --> 05:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
governor appropriated you have estimates
 
05:01:16.990 --> 05:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department it's still the
 
05:01:18.510 --> 05:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
prerogative of this committee to come up
 
05:01:20.590 --> 05:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
with your budget estimates for those for
 
05:01:22.708 --> 05:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
those programs so you're going to love
 
05:01:26.628 --> 05:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
this could you prepare one a s statement
 
05:01:26.638 --> 05:01:27.470 align:start position:0%
this could you prepare one a s statement
based

05:01:27.470 --> 05:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
based
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
on the Department's
 
05:01:32.830 --> 05:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
estimates purely and you've already done
 
05:01:34.110 --> 05:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimates correct that's
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
essentially what you have now
 
05:01:37.150 --> 05:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
essentially yeah I mean and and those
 
05:01:38.548 --> 05:01:38.558 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimates the governor's
 
05:01:40.708 --> 05:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement won't change
 
05:01:42.230 --> 05:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
division twos will change when we do a
 
05:01:44.030 --> 05:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
compar to it so I can build a division
 
05:01:46.350 --> 05:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
two with the governor's or excuse me the
 
05:01:47.868 --> 05:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
Department's estimates in there now
 
05:01:49.030 --> 05:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
let's not call division two yet let's
 
05:01:51.230 --> 05:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
just call it the education
 
05:01:53.230 --> 05:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
departments okay for division two or
 
05:01:54.430 --> 05:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
something of that nature so it doesn't
 
05:01:56.110 --> 05:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
imply that we've settled on that just we
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
can start looking at that and understand
 
05:02:00.830 --> 05:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
that create I can create something that
 
05:02:03.110 --> 05:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
that shows the impact of carrying these
 
05:02:04.708 --> 05:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
estimates yep yeah it seems like it's
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial yeah I I think it
 
05:02:07.400 --> 05:02:08.230 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial yeah I I think it
could

05:02:08.230 --> 05:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:02:11.190 --> 05:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
be substantial leave at that put tens of
 
05:02:13.390 --> 05:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
millions of
 
05:02:16.628 --> 05:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
dollars okay um further questions from
 
05:02:16.638 --> 05:02:18.190 align:start position:0%
dollars okay um further questions from
the

05:02:18.190 --> 05:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:02:21.510 --> 05:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee further comments from yeah go
 
05:02:25.548 --> 05:02:25.558 align:start position:0%
ahead represent um I I'm wondering in
 
05:02:27.110 --> 05:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
with part of you know the estimates that
 
05:02:30.990 --> 05:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
you're putting in um trying to
 
05:02:33.190 --> 05:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
accommodate what the legislature might
 
05:02:35.310 --> 05:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
do with regards to some of the bills but
 
05:02:37.030 --> 05:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that may be you know
 
05:02:38.590 --> 05:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a year whether or
 
05:02:40.110 --> 05:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
not you have to be in school for year
 
05:02:42.190 --> 05:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
before you're eligible to afas whether
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to be 350 whether it's going
 
05:02:46.190 --> 05:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
to be 400 but that may be above and
 
05:02:48.470 --> 05:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
beyond what we need to do right now
 
05:02:52.350 --> 05:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
right now yes but eventually no right so
 
05:02:55.110 --> 05:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
so let's let's assume House Bill 115
 
05:02:56.470 --> 05:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
which I believe is the FAA expansion
 
05:02:58.270 --> 05:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
bill passes I think it's on the floor
 
05:02:59.910 --> 05:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
this Thursday and does get referred to
 
05:03:02.708 --> 05:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
finance or whatever um once it becomes
 
05:03:04.708 --> 05:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
the position of the house whether it's
 
05:03:06.350 --> 05:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
in the budget or crosses over in a
 
05:03:08.788 --> 05:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
separate bill as part of the budget
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
surplus statement pack we would want an
 
05:03:12.548 --> 05:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
estimate to carry for the cost of that
 
05:03:14.910 --> 05:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
bill just like any other bill so that
 
05:03:16.350 --> 05:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
that's we're a little we're a little
 
05:03:18.270 --> 05:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
ahead of that one but that'll be a
 
05:03:19.708 --> 05:03:19.718 align:start position:0%
second committee Bill presumably so we
 
05:03:22.830 --> 05:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
then we all
 
05:03:28.070 --> 05:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
said anything else well I think the
 
05:03:29.230 --> 05:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
question is what else do you need from
 
05:03:31.868 --> 05:03:31.878 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education for our
 
05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
budget at this point I can't tell you
 
05:03:35.990 --> 05:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
what else I need does anybody else know
 
05:03:40.868 --> 05:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:43.590 --> 05:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
thanks I I think you've given us all you
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
can for the moment but that's subject to
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
change the only thing I'll point out is
 
05:03:49.110 --> 05:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
um earlier this morning there was some
 
05:03:52.030 --> 05:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
additional technical corrections to hb2
 
05:03:53.788 --> 05:03:53.798 align:start position:0%
um uh that language Mickey has that
 
05:03:55.590 --> 05:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
language um so if you have any questions
 
05:03:56.948 --> 05:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
about any because you haven't had time
 
05:03:58.510 --> 05:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
to discuss it but if you see anything
 
05:04:00.628 --> 05:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
relative to hb2 um there's some changes
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
with how we do uh special education Aid
 
05:04:06.548 --> 05:04:06.558 align:start position:0%
forecasting um and uh um syncing up how
 
05:04:08.110 --> 05:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
we uh pay Charter Schools instead of
 
05:04:09.270 --> 05:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
paying them off a November first
 
05:04:09.280 --> 05:04:10.310 align:start position:0%
paying them off a November first
headcount

05:04:10.310 --> 05:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
headcount
 
05:04:12.948 --> 05:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
um uh we asked them to do an October 1
 
05:04:14.270 --> 05:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
head count and then we asked them to do
 
05:04:16.510 --> 05:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
a November 1 head count so we have uh
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
language that Mickey has that basically
 
05:04:20.548 --> 05:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
says how about we just do the October 1
 
05:04:21.868 --> 05:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
headcount and don't bother sending the
 
05:04:23.590 --> 05:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
November 1 numbers in so these are all
 
05:04:25.830 --> 05:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
technical issues but as you see anything
 
05:04:27.590 --> 05:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh relative to hp2 any tech technical
 
05:04:29.190 --> 05:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
agers as you work with Mickey uh feel
 
05:04:31.470 --> 05:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
free to reach out to us too um and I
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
think Caitlyn was speaking to that this
 
05:04:37.110 --> 05:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
morning and indicated that there was I
 
05:04:38.110 --> 05:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
to say what you just said but that there
 
05:04:39.230 --> 05:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
was going to be some way to handle the
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
situation with special cases for for a
 
05:04:43.548 --> 05:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
particular school that or District that
 
05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
had yeah that that's another language
 
05:04:47.708 --> 05:04:47.718 align:start position:0%
that actually is introduced in hb2 so if
 
05:04:50.230 --> 05:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
you um didn't change that that's the
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's the process about um uh
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
rectifying data after taxes have been
 
05:04:57.750 --> 05:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
set um So currently we allow districts
 
05:05:01.910 --> 05:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
to uh um uh um districts can change
 
05:05:03.430 --> 05:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
their data after taxes have been set and
 
05:05:05.990 --> 05:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
it does impact their revenue flows um
 
05:05:07.230 --> 05:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to restrict that
 
05:05:08.788 --> 05:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
process and allow them to actually
 
05:05:10.548 --> 05:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
require them to the State Board to
 
05:05:12.070 --> 05:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
change their data after taxes have been
 
05:05:13.830 --> 05:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
set so we're trying to put more controls
 
05:05:15.708 --> 05:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
over that process that's an H we have a
 
05:05:17.150 --> 05:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
lot of little tiny little data
 
05:05:19.350 --> 05:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
processing stuff in hb2 which is can get
 
05:05:20.750 --> 05:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
technical so if you do have questions
 
05:05:23.990 --> 05:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
about that definitely reach out um okay
 
05:05:25.470 --> 05:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
but was that related to the comments you
 
05:05:27.030 --> 05:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
just made about the two those are
 
05:05:27.788 --> 05:05:27.798 align:start position:0%
different ones so could you
 
05:05:29.070 --> 05:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
differentiate those two so do you have
 
05:05:31.708 --> 05:05:31.718 align:start position:0%
the proposal from this morning still um
 
05:05:33.628 --> 05:05:33.638 align:start position:0%
so the first one is District adequacy so
 
05:05:36.670 --> 05:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
District adequacy um we get that the
 
05:05:37.990 --> 05:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
summer is about to end when the summer
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
ends districts are going to send in
 
05:05:41.910 --> 05:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
their eii why then we spend all summer
 
05:05:44.310 --> 05:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
making sure um uh there's no conflicting
 
05:05:46.070 --> 05:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
student data so the school year is about
 
05:05:47.470 --> 05:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
to end yeah the school year is about to
 
05:05:50.990 --> 05:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
end not the summer sorry uh uh uh and as
 
05:05:53.150 --> 05:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
the before the summer ends um we're
 
05:05:54.470 --> 05:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
working with the school districts to
 
05:05:56.230 --> 05:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that um they've accurately
 
05:05:58.830 --> 05:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
accounted for all their students and So
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
eventually get to the point where the
 
05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
data is settled and then we start paying
 
05:06:03.670 --> 05:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
September 1st adequacy based on that
 
05:06:06.310 --> 05:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
data that we've spent all summer vetting
 
05:06:09.030 --> 05:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
um then on October 1st we vet the data
 
05:06:10.670 --> 05:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
just a little bit more and then we end
 
05:06:13.270 --> 05:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
up paying uh um uh don't pay adequacy
 
05:06:14.990 --> 05:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
but then we give Dr our adequacy
 
05:06:16.350 --> 05:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
estimates in October
 
05:06:20.750 --> 05:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
1st then Dr sets taxes off that sometime
 
05:06:24.110 --> 05:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
between October 1st and April they might
 
05:06:26.150 --> 05:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
go oh we we missed a student here or
 
05:06:28.030 --> 05:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
missed a student there we're trying to
 
05:06:31.110 --> 05:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
stop that process and say if you do make
 
05:06:32.350 --> 05:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
a change to any of your student
 
05:06:34.590 --> 05:06:34.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment data after October 1st
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a process where you
 
05:06:37.110 --> 05:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
have to petition the state board and
 
05:06:38.788 --> 05:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
request that we change it instead of
 
05:06:40.628 --> 05:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
just asking us re the estimates I want
 
05:06:41.990 --> 05:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
to clarify it's not for the school year
 
05:06:43.470 --> 05:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
they're currently in it's for the school
 
05:06:45.830 --> 05:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
year that is already closed they're not
 
05:06:47.350 --> 05:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
adding any more additional kids for that
 
05:06:48.548 --> 05:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
school year that they had the
 
05:06:50.190 --> 05:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to count for that school
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
year so it's not like it's a kid that
 
05:06:53.670 --> 05:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
came and went during this existing
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
school year and that's a little bit of
 
05:06:56.948 --> 05:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
the confusion and people oftentimes get
 
05:06:58.190 --> 05:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
confused with this and like oh yeah you
 
05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
were updating it throughout the year and
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
like no no no this has nothing to do
 
05:07:02.548 --> 05:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
with this this is after taxes set the
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
numberers set we've done federal
 
05:07:06.150 --> 05:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
reporting on that number we've set cost
 
05:07:07.590 --> 05:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
per pupil on that number we've done a
 
05:07:08.708 --> 05:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of things it shouldn't be
 
05:07:11.070 --> 05:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
changing it should just Frozen yeah just
 
05:07:12.230 --> 05:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
as a commentary and I've talked to
 
05:07:13.628 --> 05:07:13.638 align:start position:0%
Chairman Earth about this whenever we do
 
05:07:15.470 --> 05:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
data collection I always say we're only
 
05:07:16.990 --> 05:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
as good as our weakest link and so if
 
05:07:18.948 --> 05:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
there's an SAU that's dragging dragging
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
their feet to get data to us um um that
 
05:07:22.708 --> 05:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
slows down the whole process and so we
 
05:07:24.030 --> 05:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
have phone calls where're well you're
 
05:07:25.548 --> 05:07:25.558 align:start position:0%
the last seu in the state we need the
 
05:07:26.910 --> 05:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
data you need to get it in so we can do
 
05:07:28.750 --> 05:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy and so this process would just
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
say you're the last seu in the state
 
05:07:31.868 --> 05:07:31.878 align:start position:0%
we're moving on you can go to the state
 
05:07:33.310 --> 05:07:33.320 align:start position:0%
board if you need if you need to move
 
05:07:35.830 --> 05:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
forward so it just adds a little bit uh
 
05:07:37.070 --> 05:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
we think adds a little more control to
 
05:07:38.910 --> 05:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
the process so the other ones on so on
 
05:07:40.350 --> 05:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
your um spreadsheet from this morning
 
05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
that house bill to so item number five
 
05:07:44.628 --> 05:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
is one of the technical Corrections Mark
 
05:07:46.110 --> 05:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned relative to State special
 
05:07:48.070 --> 05:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
education Aid so right now for State
 
05:07:49.470 --> 05:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
special education Aid We're actually
 
05:07:51.430 --> 05:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
using an estimated cost per pupil rather
 
05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
than the actual cost per pupil the
 
05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
estimated cost per pupil is estimated
 
05:07:58.548 --> 05:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
using a a pretty technical calculation
 
05:08:00.430 --> 05:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
Mark does it with school district
 
05:08:01.830 --> 05:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
budgets and some of their actual
 
05:08:03.788 --> 05:08:03.798 align:start position:0%
expenditures and we thought it would be
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's only used the only reason we're
 
05:08:08.070 --> 05:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
doing this estimate is for this area
 
05:08:09.150 --> 05:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
specifically it's not like we're using
 
05:08:10.750 --> 05:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
in other areas of the department and we
 
05:08:12.150 --> 05:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
really felt that for State special
 
05:08:14.990 --> 05:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
education Aid it should use the actual
 
05:08:16.708 --> 05:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
actual cost per pupil rather than an
 
05:08:19.868 --> 05:08:19.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:23.910 --> 05:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
pupil yeah go ahead um and special ed is
 
05:08:26.390 --> 05:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
done in real time no special education
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
is what paid one year as in a r one year
 
05:08:31.070 --> 05:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
so it is still the one year in events so
 
05:08:33.350 --> 05:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
I guess that would have been um you
 
05:08:35.510 --> 05:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
actually do know the cost there isn't
 
05:08:38.110 --> 05:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
any so so yeah what the cost is and what
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
would happen is they would send out the
 
05:08:43.350 --> 05:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
invoices in June so as the as the year
 
05:08:46.670 --> 05:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
would end they would say based on 3.5x
 
05:08:48.590 --> 05:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
the cost per pup that we published in
 
05:08:50.868 --> 05:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
January so you would know the number 6
 
05:08:53.868 --> 05:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
months earlier 3.5x the number that was
 
05:08:56.590 --> 05:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
known been known for a while now um go
 
05:08:58.830 --> 05:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
ahead and submit your invoices um well
 
05:09:00.548 --> 05:09:00.558 align:start position:0%
not they don't do in June I think it's
 
05:09:02.230 --> 05:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
May but basically a number that would
 
05:09:05.350 --> 05:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
been recorded by the department um in
 
05:09:07.590 --> 05:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
around December and January um in the
 
05:09:09.430 --> 05:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
springtime they're saying submit your
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
voices uh uh for special education Aid
 
05:09:13.830 --> 05:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
um so this just mechanically but
 
05:09:15.868 --> 05:09:15.878 align:start position:0%
currently what we're doing is in April I
 
05:09:17.350 --> 05:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
make an estimate and I give it to the
 
05:09:19.070 --> 05:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau of education and then they send
 
05:09:21.990 --> 05:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
out that estimate so it would be quicker
 
05:09:23.548 --> 05:09:23.558 align:start position:0%
instead of me doing an estimate in April
 
05:09:27.548 --> 05:09:27.558 align:start position:0%
based on budgets um uh it would just be
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
it would just be the actual number so
 
05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
yeah it seemed if it is a year behind as
 
05:09:34.150 --> 05:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
you saying you do you have the number
 
05:09:36.910 --> 05:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
yep so and then the last one is number
 
05:09:39.510 --> 05:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
13 so that willly is with Charter School
 
05:09:41.548 --> 05:09:41.558 align:start position:0%
we just it feels kind of silly that
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
they're doing an additional account for
 
05:09:45.030 --> 05:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
us in November when they've done on
 
05:09:47.270 --> 05:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
October on October 1st well they've
 
05:09:48.788 --> 05:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
really done it like October 15th but
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
based of as of October 1st it's
 
05:09:52.830 --> 05:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary work for both the department
 
05:09:54.270 --> 05:09:54.280 align:start position:0%
and the charter schools to go through to
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
get to a number that is pretty much the
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
same as on October 1st and us to make
 
05:10:00.548 --> 05:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
that payment for to the charter schools
 
05:10:02.190 --> 05:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
so we thought would just help with
 
05:10:06.750 --> 05:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:09.670 --> 05:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
everybody I hope so
 
05:10:11.590 --> 05:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
everybody get all
 
05:10:14.470 --> 05:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
that right now when I get home maybe
 
05:10:16.750 --> 05:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
not we'll have them back if we need to
 
05:10:18.548 --> 05:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
but hopefully we won't need to here and
 
05:10:22.190 --> 05:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
available other uh anything else one go
 
05:10:24.788 --> 05:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
ahead um around special ed we were
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
talking just a little bit um it was
 
05:10:30.110 --> 05:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
suggested at some point and you had
 
05:10:32.270 --> 05:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
reminded me having someone who sort of
 
05:10:34.190 --> 05:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
boots on the ground around special ed
 
05:10:35.868 --> 05:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
come in and is it too late to have that
 
05:10:37.670 --> 05:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
to have a superintendent or someone who
 
05:10:40.150 --> 05:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
works with special ed to have walk us
 
05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
through what actually happens in the
 
05:10:44.030 --> 05:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
school district when a special ed
 
05:10:45.470 --> 05:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
student comes in is there still time to
 
05:10:47.590 --> 05:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
have someone come in to do that or do
 
05:10:49.230 --> 05:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
you think it's not necessary I guess I'd
 
05:10:52.430 --> 05:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
refer that to Mr Lander so
 
05:10:54.868 --> 05:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
sometime maybe next week maybe the week
 
05:10:56.430 --> 05:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
after uh we're going to get bills
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
referred to us presumably on Thursday
 
05:11:01.270 --> 05:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
one being House Bill 773 which is
 
05:11:03.510 --> 05:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
related to the cadid program so perhaps
 
05:11:04.910 --> 05:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
when we schedule a work session on that
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
bill I'll invite the department to come
 
05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
in like I always do and perhaps they can
 
05:11:10.150 --> 05:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
see if there's administrator that makes
 
05:11:13.270 --> 05:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
sense to to bring in for for that to
 
05:11:17.150 --> 05:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:21.628 --> 05:11:21.638 align:start position:0%
sense yeah we do several many
 
05:11:38.190 --> 05:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:25.788 --> 05:12:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:29.190 --> 05:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
else get duplica we don't need
 
05:12:31.910 --> 05:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
toar so thank you all for coming Kaitlyn
 
05:12:33.990 --> 05:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
and your crew um to see you again
 
05:12:39.310 --> 05:12:39.320 align:start position:0%

05:12:47.868 --> 05:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
much I hope you get paid
 
05:12:51.190 --> 05:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
well you can look it
 
05:12:56.190 --> 05:12:56.200 align:start position:0%

if we're done for today I think that's
 
05:12:59.830 --> 05:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
we had a productive day so Friday we
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
have a work session scheduled at 10: uh
 
05:13:03.948 --> 05:13:03.958 align:start position:0%
I'm going to come in with some tracking
 
05:13:05.390 --> 05:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
sheets just to kind of compile
 
05:13:06.590 --> 05:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
everything you've kind of heard to this
 
05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
point and try to get it all in front of
 
05:13:11.150 --> 05:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
you um perhaps some amendments easy ones
 
05:13:12.350 --> 05:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
like we've talked about some things in
 
05:13:14.910 --> 05:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
house bill to um perhaps some sections
 
05:13:16.110 --> 05:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
that could just be deleted because they
 
05:13:18.190 --> 05:13:18.200 align:start position:0%
have other bills up I'm going to try to
 
05:13:19.948 --> 05:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
come up with a plan the next couple days
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
